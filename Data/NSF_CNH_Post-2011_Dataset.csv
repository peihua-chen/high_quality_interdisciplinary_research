1824951,CNH-S: What Does It Take to Cooperate Over Transboundary Groundwater Resources?,ICER,DYN COUPLED NATURAL-HUMAN,08-01-18,08/14/2018,Marc Muller,IN,University of Notre Dame,Standard Grant,Richard Yuretich,07/31/2021,"$749,932.00 ","Diogo Bolster, Michele Muller-Itten, Bruce Huber",mmuller1@nd.edu,940 Grace Hall,NOTRE DAME,IN,465565708,5746317432,GEO,1691,"1691, 9278",$0.00 ,"While crucial to the health and livelihood of billions of people, groundwater is being depleted globally at alarming rates. Groundwater is a shared resource, where pumping by any user decreases groundwater levels and thus the ability of other users to also exploit this resource. This phenomenon can cause users to strategically over-exploit groundwater in a ""pumping race"" that can accelerate its depletion. Unfortunately, few regulations address this tragedy of the commons because the underground nature of the resource makes it particularly challenging to monitor. This research seeks to estimate the extent to which strategic over-exploitation accelerates global groundwater depletion, and to identify new mechanisms to explain why groundwater is particularly prone to strategic over-exploitation, especially at jurisdictional boundaries. These new insights will be used to explore new regulatory approaches to curtail this behavior.  This research will benefit society by integrating hydrology, economics, and law to improve cooperation over shared groundwater resources. It will also provide interdisciplinary training for three graduate students and create valuable infrastructure that will be shared broadly with businesses and the public sector.<br/> <br/>Adverse selection is the tendency for markets to break down under asymmetric information, because uncertainties cause agents to attribute ulterior motives to other agents' willingness to make a deal. A similar mechanism likely arises for groundwater due to asymmetric hydro-geologic uncertainty. This research will test the hypothesis that adverse selection explains why agents do not cooperate over shared groundwater resources. The project has four components: (1) perform a global assessment of the role played by tragedies of the commons in the depletion of international aquifers; (2) derive a micro-economic model to investigate whether adverse selection can explain the dearth of international agreements on shared groundwater; (3) develop coupled human/groundwater models to investigate why cooperation has emerged in specific aquifers, through case studies in Europe and South America; and (4) investigate the potential for satellite data to attenuate information asymmetry and facilitate cooperation by averting adverse selection, focusing on a vulnerable aquifer identified in component (1).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project will conduct an experimental investigation of a novel disease-control strategy that incorporates the reintroduction of native prawns to determine whether they might help reduce the prevalence of the snails that host the parasitic worms for that spread schistosomiasis, which is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in the world.  The project will test the idea that reintroduction of the native prawns as predators will repair the aquatic food web that has been disrupted by dam construction and significantly reduce transmission of schistosomiasis by reducing the prevalence of the parasites.  The project will investigate whether and how prawn restoration can be sustainable as well as add an important protein food source and market resource for the people living along the rivers.  The project will provide new understanding regarding the complex interaction of human and natural forces to alter patterns of disease transmission.  It will enhance knowledge across a range of fields, including trophic ecology, epidemiology, aquaculture, economics, and other social sciences as well as mathematical modeling.  The project therefore will provide new insights regarding how biodiversity may be enhanced, how human health may improve, and how native prawn aquaculture may provide benefits to the rural market economy.  The transmission of schistosomiasis by parasites from infected snails when people use open water systems for bathing, washing clothes and equipment, tending livestock, farming, or playing has led to the infection of about 220 million people, with an estimated 200,000 deaths per year from schistosomiasis around the world.  More than 95 percent of the infections are occur in Africa, and this project will be based in the Senegal River ecosystem of western Africa, but the project will provide both basic and applied insights regarding the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems related to the transmission of diseases in rivers and other water bodies in other locales, including many in the U.S.  The project also will provide special education and training opportunities for post-doctoral researchers as well as graduate and undergraduate students.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.<br/><br/>The project will be conducted by researchers constituting a team drawn from many different disciplines.  They will conduct experiments where prawns will be enclosed at water-use sites and disease transmission will be compared with control sites to determine the effect of prawns on snail abundance and on human infection rates.  Reintroduction of the prawns will be combined with drug treatments and will be analyzed with economic models, consideration of human behavior, and monitoring of snail and human infections.  The information from these components of the project will be synthesized with mathematical models.  This project will contribute to the technology of cultivation of the prawns as part of the ecosystem recovery and augmentation of natural snail predators, and prawn-stocking and harvest strategies will be modeled to seek the best approach to maximize public health while also offering a nutritional and market incentive to sustain prawn populations."

Millions of hectares of tropical forests have been converted to agriculture leaving behind patches of remnant natural forest embedded in an agricultural matrix. Historically, this agricultural matrix was dominated by subsistence crops and pasture, but in some areas this land is rapidly being replaced with intensive plantation agriculture for soybean, banana, and pineapple production. In contrast with more traditional land uses, these crops require higher inputs of labor, money, agrochemicals, and infrastructure. The impacts of this new land conversion trend are not well understood, but preliminary studies suggest that intensive plantation agriculture may drive dramatic demographic and economic changes in local communities and have profound effects on ecological systems. Ultimately, these impacts will change the ability of these human and ecological communities to maintain resilience to future change. Thus, a better understanding is needed of the relationships among land-use policies, ecosystem structure and function, and the decisions and actions of local communities and land managers that ultimately determine where and how fast intensive plantation agriculture will spread. This project will evaluate these relationships in the model system of the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica. Specifically, this research will address a variety of research questions, such as: What national policies led to the establishment and spread of intensive non-traditional plantation crops? For three focal regions, what is the status of the social and ecological indicators of resilience? How will current and alternative policy scenarios affect future land use patterns, and how will these affect ecological resilience? How does future scenario modeling of projected land use changes influence the perceptions of community members and land managers about their future social and ecological resilience? This effort incorporates stakeholder input at every step of the research; implements two new ecological approaches, functional traits analysis and landscape genetics; and explicitly measures both social and ecological resilience in the same system and at multiple spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>Findings from this research will advance understanding of how human communities and ecosystems respond to agricultural intensification, and will therefore help scientists and managers better understand how to manage for resilience in the face of global change. At the local scale, findings will be shared through stakeholder workshops with community leaders and regional land managers; these workshops will provide participants with information to make informed land use decisions, and develop community capacity to adapt to change. At the global scale, findings from this research will be disseminated through presentations at the participating universities, at professional conferences, and through publication of peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals.  In addition, this project will contribute to the interdisciplinary research training of multiple undergraduates and five Ph.D. students, all from under-represented groups.

This project will collect archeological data on ancient human land use, vegetation, and land form at four Neolithic sites in Spain and Italy.  These data will guide the development of models of social and natural processes that will attempt to predict the long-term outcomes of alternative patterns of land use.  The predictions will be checked against new knowledge of what has actually happened over centuries of use.  Based on these checks, the models will be refined to simulate the feedbacks through which human decisions are affected by land cover and terrain, vegetation is affected by land use and landscape change, and the land surface and soils are affected by land cover and use.<br/><br/>By increasing our ability to learn from the past, this project will help the U.S. plan for more sustainable agriculture and development of towns and cities.  To help disseminate results, the modeling software created will be available on line.  The extensive educational component of the project comprises extensive training of undergraduate and graduate students including members of groups under-represented in science, a summer program to train K-12 teachers to use models of landscape change, and the incorporation of findings into courses at four universities."

These include potent pharmaceutical classes including synthetic steroids, whose bioactivity can persist in the environment despite their transformation through natural and engineered processes. In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, a collaborative team of researchers at the University of Iowa, University of Washington at Tacoma and Seattle, University of California at San Diego, and Stony Brook University develops a predictive framework to help catalyze more robust water regulations and improved chemical risk assessment. Ultimately, outcomes of this project moves society toward more safe and sustainable water supplies, particularly as society becomes more reliant on reuse of treated wastewater to bridge the widening gap in supply and demand. The broader impacts of this work include advancing undergraduate education by enabling the participation of under-represented groups in research activities, integrating modern computational tools into student learning, and promoting scientific literacy in non-technical audiences through general education coursework development.<br/> <br/>This work represents a new paradigm in water quality management. Focusing on a widely utilized abiotic treatment process, chlorination, and ubiquitous but understudied pollutant classes, potent synthetic progestins and glucocorticoids, this project will develop a high-throughput framework built upon computational and experimental methods for the a priori prediction of high risk, bioactive transformation products. This approach integrates (i) theoretical calculations to identify probable chlorination products using descriptors for both parent (partial charges, oxidation potentials) and likely product (thermodynamic stability) species. (ii) Potential product species are prioritized based on bioactivity (i.e., risk) using high throughput virtual ligand screening.  Once identified, formation and yield of high risk products are evaluated (iii) in bench-scale experiments across a range of chlorination conditions and (iv) via high resolution mass spectrometric detection in wastewaters and receiving waters. Research outcomes ensures that when emerging pollutant classes are inevitably regulated, a more holistic approach is available that also addresses risks posed by their bioactive products.

Although only 30 percent of the African population lived in urban centers in 2000, this percentage is projected to double by 2050, with the majority of growth occurring in small- to medium-sized cities.  Given the heavy reliance on charcoal as an energy source in African cities, rapid urbanization likely will increase forest degradation.  This project will investigate interactions among urban and rural livelihoods and the health of the Miombo woodland ecosystems.  Miombo woodlands are the most extensive forested ecosystem in Africa, covering 2.7-million square-km throughout eight southern African countries.  The researchers will investigate how local-level decisions regarding charcoal production and consumption in changing economic and environmental contexts influence rates of forest degradation in Mozambique's Miombo woodlands.  They will examine the charcoal trade in Tete, a mid-sized but rapidly growing city, to analyze how simultaneous economic and environmental change impact the well-being of people and the landscapes in which they live.  They will integrate socioeconomic analysis and ecosystem modeling to better understand forest degradation in poorer regions that are rapidly integrating into the global economy.  The results of the socioeconomic analyses will enable the refinement of an ecosystem model that accounts for consumer and producer preferences in charcoal production systems and their impact on forest degradation rates.  The model will be used to simulate charcoal-driven forest degradation under various social, economic, and environmental scenarios in order to identify patterns that could compromise the sustainable use of Miombo woodlands and the well-being of urban and rural residents.  Although focusing on a specific case study in Mozambique, many facets of the analysis will be of value in understanding coupled natural and human system dynamics in other nations and ecosystems."

Small-scale fisheries, in particular, are incredibly important; they employ more than 90 percent of the world's approximately 35 million capture fishermen worldwide, and contribute over half of the world's marine and inland fish catch, nearly all of which is used for direct human consumption. Small-scale fisheries shape coastal cultures, economies, and ecosystems. Yet knowledge of small-scale fisheries is notoriously poor, in part because they often are marginalized within their own communities and nations. With the increasing emphasis on reconciling food security and other development aims with environmental conservation, integrated understanding of small-scale fisheries is more critical than ever. This research project will develop fundamental knowledge of human-environment interactions in coastal marine systems, and help inform the development and evaluation of innovative small-scale fisheries management strategies.  Specifically, this research will examine how environmental and economic variability and institutional diversity shape the resilience and adaptive capacity of the coupled natural and human systems associated with the small-scale fisheries.<br/><br/>This work will focus on the reciprocal interactions between the ecosystems and institutions associated with small-scale fisheries in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur (BCS). BCS is an ideal model system in which to investigate these human-ecosystem dynamics, given its variability of institutional, economic, and ecological contexts. For most fishermen in BCS, access to necessary capital inputs (boats, gear, etc.) is achieved either through membership in a fishing-cooperative or via a relationship with a patron. Both empirical evidence and theory suggest that fisheries dominated by cooperatives may contribute to improved ecosystem and human wellbeing outcomes, relative to those dominated by patron-client relationships. But the mechanisms underlying these differences and how they may contribute to resilience of human and natural systems to environmental and economic variability are not well understood, nor have they been well tested empirically. This work will address these gaps by integrating field and synthetic investigations at the scale of individual fishing communities throughout BCS. This work will generate new social and ecological data including information on fish abundances and distributions, indicators of ecological resilience and ecosystem health, information on fishermen activities and community characteristics, indicators of institutional resilience, and indicators of individual and community well-being. The project will also create targeted dynamic models of key human-environment interactions that will address core issues in coupled human-natural system science, ecology, economics, and common-pools resources studies."

For example, citizen-driven lake associations often form in response to deteriorating water quality, and are becoming increasingly effective in driving changes in land management and policies that greatly improve lake environments. <br/><br/>This project examines the linkages between land use, lake water quality, and local communities in three contrasting U.S. lake systems. Insights from these lake systems will in turn inform the study of human-natural system dynamics across thousands of other lakes throughout the northeastern and midwestern U.S. An understanding of these relationships and feedbacks will help inform the development of effective programs and policies to protect and enhance lake water quality.<br/><br/>This project investigates the nature and extent of linkages among human and natural systems in lake catchments. The project will develop a novel coupling framework that links process-based human and natural system models to trace the effects of land-use decisions on nutrient fluxes through lake ecosystems; represent how hydrological and limnological processes transform nutrient loads into changes in the water quality metrics valued by people; and determine how water quality changes feed back into human decision making by affecting property values and collective action by citizen groups. For three contrasting catchments in the northeastern and midwestern U.S., the project explores these linkages by deriving essential management variables that describe the critical drivers of human-natural system dynamics and the relationships between those drivers. These results provide an integrated foundation for a suite of statistical approaches that will be used to scale up and extrapolate the results to a diverse set of lake catchments representative of continental-scale gradients.

This characterization may be true for long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, but it is not true of compounds that are considered short-lived local pollutants (SLLPs) such as particulate matter, black carbon, sulfur dioxide and tropospheric ozone. These short-lived pollutants impact atmospheric conditions and air quality through different mechanisms over a range of spatial and temporal scales. LLGHGs and SLLPs are often co-emitted by the same processes, albeit in widely differing quantities and combinations, but to date, scientists and policymakers have largely treated these different types of emissions as both interchangeable and separable. This approach is incomplete because individual emissions species rarely can be mitigated in isolation and the net global and regional impacts of different mitigation portfolios should consider the sum of both LLGHG and SLLP effects. A full understanding of environmental impacts, and of mitigation costs and benefits, requires that SLLPs and LLGHGs be considered together, and thus is the focus of this project. Additionally, this project will contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by training several undergraduate and graduate students to work on interdisciplinary research of societal importance.<br/>This project will utilize a coupled systems approach to understanding the joint roles of LLGHGs and SLLPs in the dynamics of natural (atmospheric) and human (policymaking) systems, as well as in the processes that connect them.

Regional spatial datasets will be combined with the results from county-level easement donor surveys and both fine and coarse filter ecological integrity approaches to assess whether conservation easements whose purpose is to maintain biological integrity have a higher likelihood of contributing to reserve networks in their spatial arrangement than do other conservation easements. Whether this is more likely to occur in areas with public oversight in the easement placement process will be determined. How the environmental outcomes affect the easement decision process will be addressed. Theory will be advanced by examining the geographic effect of the easement tool, and how social factors may influence its use, in a single spatial and quantitative framework. Broader impacts will include better understanding of the complete conservation easement process for planners and land owners and the training of undergraduate and graduate students."

However, because PHS programs seek to influence both human behavior and the environment, they are extremely complex, and the scientific understanding needed to maximize their effectiveness is lacking. The goal of this project is to analyze the interacting social, economic, ecological, hydrological and policy impacts of Mexico's PHS programs, which have been operating for over a decade and thus represent some of the longest running programs of their kind in the world. The project will focus on two types of PHS programs operating within the Pixquiac and Gavilanes watersheds near Xalapa and Coatepec, Veracruz: 1) the ""national"" program, which is centrally organized and administered by the Mexican government, and 2) the local ""matching"" program, which requires greater involvement of diverse local institutions in the financing, planning, and execution of the program.  Impacts of the PHS programs on water and other (e.g., biodiversity, carbon) ecosystem services will be assessed using a combination of field data collection and modeling.  Interviews and surveys will be used to assess the influence of the two PHS programs (national and local) on people's decisions, as well as interactions with other social qualities such as perceptions of equity and well-being, health, income opportunities, and social organization. The information collected for the human and natural systems will be integrated through the application of spatial mapping tools, watershed modeling, and participatory workshops involving multiple actors in order to identify the key factors that determine the long-term success and cost-benefit trade-offs of PHS programs. This integrated approach will also be used to test the effects of different PHS policy and land use change scenarios on ecosystem services and long-term watershed sustainability.  <br/><br/>This project will contribute significantly to enhancing society's ability to protect water resources by developing an interdisciplinary approach for understanding how PHS policies both shape - and are shaped by - the coupled human and natural systems they seek to influence. Additionally, an important aspect of this research is that it will advance the current level of knowledge about PHS programs to encompass the larger concept of watershed sustainability, which to date has not been an integral component of PHS yet is crucial to protecting water resources. Results will be integrated into two science-based decision support tools that can be used by landowners and decision makers achieve desired watershed management and policy goals while avoiding unintended consequences: an aggregate sustainability index that provides concise information on watershed health, and a GIS-based mapping framework that spatially integrates impacts of land use change on ecosystem services and their relationship with coupled human and natural systems. Given that PHS programs are rapidly becoming an important policy mechanism worldwide for addressing critical environmental issues related to water supply and quality, the findings from this research will have broad impacts by helping to guide the design of more effective PHS policies across the globe.  To ensure successful local and global application of this research, findings will be widely disseminated through diverse portals, including policy forums, news media, interdisciplinary and disciplinary scientific journals, an edited book volume on global PHS programs, and a series of educational modules and seminars developed for both the middle school and university levels.  Finally, this project will train and mentor one postdoctoral research associate, four graduate students, and several undergraduate students, all of whom will gain valuable skills in interdisciplinary thinking and analysis and sustainability science within the context water resource management."

Mangroves provide a number of ecosystem services that are particularly beneficial to low-income coastal communities. However, dependence on natural resources can lead to environmental degradation. Despite the importance of this interaction, there is a significant gap in understanding the relationship between mangrove ecosystem services and poverty traps, mechanisms that cause poverty to persist, in low income coastal communities. This interdisciplinary research is a first step toward advancing our understanding of ecosystem services through the lens of poverty traps. It empirically investigates important feedback loops, drivers and other mechanisms that link poverty traps and mangrove ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project will inform stakeholders involved in coastal resource management and poverty alleviation how changes in mangrove ecosystem services are associated with poverty and vice versa, and examine new approaches to break the vicious cycle of resource degradation and poverty. The findings can potentially be extended to efforts to sustain ecosystem services provided by other natural resources in developing economies.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted in rural coastal Tanzania where degradation of mangrove resources and persistent poverty continue to be significant challenges. An interdisciplinary research team with expertise in economics, ecology, hydrology, climatology, and system modeling will undertake a two-year study to conceptualize and provide empirical evidence for the feedback loops, drivers, and thresholds existing within and across natural and human systems for multiple ecogeomorphological and poverty conditions. The researchers will collect and use a wide range of ecological and socioeconomic data by synchronizing the temporal and spatial scales at four sites. Four ecosystem services of mangrove forests that are likely interlinked with poverty will be examined: (a) goods extracted (fuel wood, building poles, and charcoal), (b) fish and shrimp habitats, (c) coastal protection, and (d) prospects for carbon storage (as a net carbon sink),which will be assessed as a potential source of revenue to break poverty-environment traps. The ecological processes of mangrove ecosystem functions and their services, as well as the decision rules related to natural resource use, management, and livelihood inferred from empirical evidence will then be used to build an agent-based model to scale up to a regional level. This approach will help identify system-wide effects under alternative scenarios and simulate directions in which the coupled systems can evolve to benefit both the environment and coastal communities."

The project will focus on two overarching themes: the importance of feedbacks in natural-human systems and the importance of value systems and customary practices that are not adequately captured by knowledge systems alone.  It will provide new insights and information regarding how changes in forest ecosystem structure and function result in new relationships between humans and forest species and services as well as how forest-management practices influence ecosystems.  The project also will advance understanding of the complex reciprocal relationships among values and practices, including traditional knowledge of indigenous people, and decision making by individuals and communities.  Furthermore, the project will enhance understanding of the degree to which individuals and communities hold cultural, spiritual, ethical, and aesthetic values and engage in customary forests practices that are not adequately captured by conventional knowledge systems.  Because the project's participants include the College of the Menominee Nation, the project will provide opportunities for Native American students to have education and training opportunities with respect to both basic research and to the use of innovative technologies, including virtual reality software and devices.  Other education and training opportunities in the conduct of interdisciplinary science will be provided for graduate students and post-doctoral scholars.  The project will promote collaborations among educators, scientists, and managers in the region and will inform ongoing environmental assessment activities focused on indigenous peoples and tribal knowledge.  The project also will contribute to enhanced decision making for environmental change adaptation in tribal communities by providing clear routes by which values and relationships with forests can be embedded within state-of-the-art optimization procedures, and it will assist forest managers and community members in working together to evaluate trade-offs when making decisions.<br/><br/>Traditional knowledge from indigenous cultures is recognized as important in environmental assessments but has not been adequately captured in landscape-level planning.  Forests managed by tribal communities are under threat from increasing insect damage, which is already the most spatially extensive forest disturbance in North America, affecting approximately 20 million hectares of forest per year with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.  Significant changes to forests could adversely impact the forest industries upon which many tribal communities depend and could alter tribal identity.  The investigators will use state-of-the-art visualization and virtual reality experiences about future forest conditions to access a broader range of human values about scenarios of future forest conditions.  These outcomes will be used to model preferences in forest-management activities and determine trade-offs and synergies among economic and other value-based decisions about forest management.  The investigators will employ anthropological, ethical, process-based, and immersive means to explore the complex factors that influence how people and communities make decisions and evaluate trade-offs among diverse objectives when faced with considerable uncertainty.  The investigators will test a set of hypotheses, include the propositions that immersive virtual reality can enhance emotive and cognitive perceptions of environmental changes and that current management activities can be refined through the incorporation of value structures into a robust decision making analysis.  Values and practices will be incorporated into consensus mental models, which will inform information available via immersive virtual reality and ecosystem modeling, and the investigators will enhance a decision support algorithm to assess trade-offs in outcomes.  The immersive virtual reality experiences will include interactive 2-D and 3-D landscape maps, 360-degree depictions of alternative forest structures, and interactive maps through time.  The decision-analytics approach will facilitate analysis of trade-offs across a broad set of sustainability metrics and will help test the performance of alternative strategies under uncertain future conditions.  The investigators will characterize and tradeoffs and synergies among competing values that reflect cultural, ecological, and economic well-being and assist in determination of what choices lead to sustainable solutions.

This project investigates the dynamic connections among these areas of concern and evaluates strategies that can alleviate problems in the future. It examines how people use forest resources for energy and whether these habits are altered by the introduction of more efficient cooking stoves and other new technologies. The effects on forest condition will be examined through direct measurements and modeling. Measurements of air quality will determine how pollution levels will be affected. The field sites are in Malawi and the results will be scaled up to determine the possible changes in the larger regions of eastern and southern Africa. This research has the potential to improve forest condition and air quality in areas at risk of severely declining environmental conditions, and improve the quality of life for large numbers of people who depend upon these resources.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to investigate linkages between the use of biomass energy in Southern Africa and its coupled impacts on human, terrestrial, and atmospheric systems.

Water-limited arid and semiarid cities are experiencing disproportionate increases in population and land transformation worldwide, increasing stress on water resources and altering natural hydrological systems. Cities face significant challenges in providing clean water for municipal and industrial uses and in managing the environmental water quality and flooding risks that accompany urbanization. The growth of cities will require a continuing investment in infrastructure and in new strategies to adapt to water resource limitations. In the face of demographic and global change, the sustainability of water resources in arid and semiarid cities will be a key challenge. Addressing this challenge will require improved understanding of how water availability and distribution changes with urbanization, and how these changes affect ecosystem service provision and policy responses. Policy and governance decisions aimed at enhancing ecosystem services related to water resources need to be based on scientific evidence to be effective. However, better science does not necessarily lead to better governance; there remains a gap between scientific knowledge and the actions taken as a result of this knowledge. The objective of this project is to improve understanding of the linkages between ecosystem services and governance of water resources.   <br/><br/>This project will study the natural and human components of semi-arid cities in the US Southwest in order to determine if various attributes of these urbanized systems encourage learning and action that lead to more sustainable outcomes. This research will draw on theoretical frameworks that explicitly link ecological structure and function to ecosystem services to information flows to decision making. Specifically, four key questions will be addressed: (a) How does the frequency, intensity and redistribution of rainfall and runoff influence the eco-hydrologic response of arid and semi-arid urbanized systems and result in emergent ecosystem services? (b) How do human system conditions affect city-level learning about actions that influence ecosystem service provision? (c) How do natural system conditions influence social networks, understanding, and decision-making about water management and infrastructure? And (d) What actions have been taken, in terms of alterations to the built environment, that influence the effect of the built environment on natural system processes? These questions will be answered through a set of field, survey, lab, workshop, and synthetic experiments. Specifically a suite of research sites will be established in Tucson, Sierra Vista, and Yuma, Arizona that will allow investigations from the 1 ha/individual to the 100,000 ha/regional scales. Natural system investigations will focus on how eco-hydrologic processes integrate from the point to large catchment scale and characterize ecosystem services. The social dimensions of this project will focus on the policy and governance sectors to understand learning, decision-making and action at the municipal scale and importantly across social and bioclimatic regions.

The project will enhance basic understanding of the interactive effects that noise has on bird diversity and on the perceptions and actions of people.  The project will provide a test of the hypothesis that as bird diversity declines when human-made noise fills the soundscape, individual and group valuation of wildlife and the acoustic environment decline, thereby reducing support for nature conservation, which ratchets declines in bird diversity further downward.

A particular concern in this area is the export of excess nitrate from the use of fertilizers on lawns, which can promote algal or microbial growth in receiving waters. Recent research has indicated that such nitrate export is less than expected, but the reasons for this are unclear. This project will investigate both the natural processes that may regulate the retention and discharge of nitrogen from lawns, as well as the sociological forces that influence the decisions of homeowners concerning the level of lawn management. The results will be incorporated into a model that will identify the locations and episodes of high nitrate in runoff in order to determine how human decisions and natural processes work together to control these concentrations. The conclusions will be applicable to a wide variety of urban and suburban locations across the country and the project will have direct benefit to the management of the environmental health of Chesapeake Bay. <br/><br/>This project models multi-scale, coupled-system dynamics of nitrogen in residential landscapes to determine how biogeochemical, hydrologic, and human behavioral processes interact to control nitrogen exports from residential ecosystems and landscapes. These models will coordinate information from household surveys, existing data, and geographic information system analyses to evaluate interconnected spatial patterns of lawn management and hydrologic sensitivity. The overarching hypothesis is that large-scale social and institutional influences often induce homeowner lawn-care practices contrary to homeowner preferences, but that significant changes in behavior can be motivated via systematic incentives. Field studies on plots varying in land use history (forest versus agriculture), site management (fertilizer input) and age will be established to test hypotheses about the limits of nitrogen sequestration in lawn soil profiles. Geographic, biogeochemical, and social-science data will be analyzed using ecohydrological models to produce spatial analyses of potential hotspots of lawn fertilizer export at the watershed scale. The effect of alternative policies and homeowner practices on land management and nitrogen exports can then be evaluated rigorously."

Changes in climate will alter ecosystem structure and function, affecting the distribution of subsistence resources and access to the areas where resources are harvested. High fuel costs (e.g., heating, transportation) have forced rural households to make economic sacrifices to maintain and use equipment needed for subsistence. To address these issues, this project will: 1) document specific impacts that environmental change and energy costs are having on subsistence, 2) identify and link characteristics of the human (e.g., policy, household economics) and natural (e.g., climate patterns, landscape change) system that influence vulnerability to impacts, 3) evaluate the effectiveness of current responses to impacts, and 4) enhance communication networks among communities and researchers to foster future adaptation to globally-driven changes. Rather than considering global-change adaptation as a set of discrete actions, this research will treat actions as feedback loops that link social and ecological components at community and regional scales and will test the hypothesis that ineffective adaptation to global change results in part from weak or missing feedbacks. The project involves collaboration with local communities as well as with federal, state, and tribal organizations in Alaska to develop and enhance networks that invent, test, and share adaptations at regional and larger scales. It will enhance capacity to adapt to environmental change in Alaska by engaging community leaders and training graduate students, many of whom are Alaska Natives, in an interdisciplinary research process. Of the 14-member project team, 21% are Alaska Native, 50% are women, and 43% are early-career scholars.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel framework (adaptive coupling) to study adaptation in social-ecological systems. It will integrates vulnerability and resilience science in a systems context.

The project will test the hypothesis that ineffective adaptation to global change results in part from weak or missing feedbacks from impacts on communities back to the local drivers or factors mediating community sensitivity to these drivers. The investigators seek to understand reasons for weak or missing feedbacks. The research will contribute to theory by integrating qualitative insights from the social sciences (especially related to political ecology and adaptive and collaborative capacities) with more quantitative information from ecology, hydrology, and economics within a systems framework. The dynamics and pathways by which adaptation scales from individual communities to a region will be investigated. In contrast to the literature on top-down diffusion of innovation from agencies to local entities, the investigators will focus on the grassroots emergence of novelty and factors that influence its regional diffusion. The focus on the interface between theory and practical application of knowledge in local communities has the potential to transform the western linear (loading dock) model of science to a more iterative adaptive approach that recognizes the intellectual value of local knowledge and the importance of real-world application as a learning laboratory."

In recent decades these programs have increased in popularity, and an increasing number of parallel PES programs have been deployed to mitigate environmental degradation and the over-exploitation of natural resources. PES programs are often implemented concurrently in the same temporal and spatial context, yet little understanding exists about the mechanisms, pathways, and social and ecological effects of such interacting, parallel PES programs. This project will analyze how and why parallel PES programs interact with one another and with the corresponding coupled natural and human system. This work will result in generating insight into the potential, often unintended, social and ecological consequences. PES programs may impact human migration, investment in education, and other connections between local households and the physical environment. Furthermore, the project will address how such programs may affect changes in land cover, land use, and species habitat over time. This project will benefit society by addressing the interactions between development conservation policy and the effectiveness of governmental investments made in PES programs. This project's broader impacts also extend to innovative education and outreach activities that mentor K-12 students and their teachers, creative use of new geospatial technologies for effective monitoring and conservation of endangered wildlife, development of a student-centered pedagogy that enhances understanding of complex human-environment systems, and the development of a related movie and a web-based PES Center to disseminate project results.  The research will train graduate students and foster collaboration between U.S. and Chinese scientists.  <br/><br/>The project aims to understand the reciprocal relationship between parallel PES programs, shedding light on the related social and ecological consequences of these programs over space and time. The PIs will answer the following questions: (1) Through what pathways or mediating variables do parallel PES programs, through their influence on human and natural subsystems, affect one another? (2) Where and to what extent do parallel PES programs lead to net changes in the environment? (3) How has and will the human-environment system evolve over space and time given these interventions? Within the human subsystem the PIs will focus on the impacts of migration and job opportunities, as well as the educational investments of participating households. Within the natural subsystem, the PIs will document and monitor land cover and land use change, as well as occupancy and habitat of major mammal species using an unmanned aerial vehicle, camera trapping, and satellite imaging techniques. Lastly, the PIs will develop a complex systems framework, which consists of geospatial and statistical analyses, structural equation modeling, and development of an agent-based model (ABM) integrating qualitative and quantitative data and models across various spatial and temporal scales.

Foundational science is needed to understand how water storage in headwaters will change and how downstream communities will adapt to those changes. This award will study how headwater dependent systems water storage changes by coupling knowledge of watershed hydrology, climatology and downstream human development in multiple watersheds across a latitudinal transect across North and South America.

Urban landscapes are excellent settings within which to examine interactions ecological and human communities.  Urban areas that have experienced a traumatic event can be highly tractable systems for studying potential parallels between ecological and socioeconomic systems as well as feedbacks among them.  With acute trauma resulting in an initial state change, the assembly and reassembly of proximate or coincident urban ecological and human communities can be a coupled dynamic, where outcomes are contingent on responses to common forcing factors or interactions arising from management interventions.  The catastrophic flooding of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina resulted in a natural laboratory for investigating assembly and reassembly of coupled natural and human systems.  The investigators will determine the extent to which ecological and socioeconomic diversity exhibited parallel responses to Katrina-related flooding.  They also will examine how interventions executed as public health measures shaped relationships and interactions between ecological and socioeconomic diversity.  They will conduct geographic information system-based analyses of landscape heterogeneity and socioeconomic variation before and after Hurricane Katrina as well as plot-based inventories of post-Katrina plant communities while accounting for flooding and socioeconomic stratification.  They will examine the ecology and demography of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), a habitat-dependent primary reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, in order to understand human health outcomes of flooding.  This facet of the research will involve a trap-based census; population genetic analysis of abundance and dispersal, and histological analysis of pathogen prevalence.  Mail surveys and in-person interviews of households proximate to plant inventory and trapping sites as well as households in four neighborhoods having different income and ethnicity characteristics will be administered to determine how perceptions of risk compare to physical measures of exposure risk across the city.  Information gained from these studies will be integrated into a spatially explicit predictive model of Norway rat demography to assess ecological and human-health outcomes of alternative control scenarios reflecting habitat suitability, movement, and risk perceptions.<br/><br/>Trauma can have enduring consequences on environments and societies.

As contamination causes a variety of severe health problems in humans, including several forms of cancer and increased infant mortality Recent field evidence shows how human activities can elevate As concentrations and suggests many more people could be affected in the coming decades. Massive groundwater pumping for the supply of both megacities and rice irrigation could contaminate deep aquifers that currently have low levels of As, by drawing in groundwater that is high in As. Furthermore, irrigation with high-As groundwater markedly reduces the yield of rice crops, threatening food security. The extent of groundwater contamination in affected areas is determined by a combination of individual farmers' practices and the decisions made by large municipalities. In order to study these interactions, the researchers will model how human decisions affect As levels in aquifers across three river basins that have experienced differing degrees of development. The study will identify effective measures to reduce the amounts of As in groundwater and rice crops, leading to safer food and water supplies. <br/><br/>Aquifer vulnerability will be assessed by tracking the penetration of the radioisotopes of hydrogen in water and carbon released to the atmosphere between 1950 and 1970 relative to As in groundwater. Several hundred wells distributed along three 30 km transects, some affected by municipal and irrigation pumping and others not, will be sampled for these and additional tracers. These measurements will be combined with modeling of groundwater flow and As transport to determine whether irrigation pumping or municipal pumping poses a more serious threat. Farmer behavior will be assessed through a randomized controlled trial by providing field-kits for measuring As in irrigation water and paddy soil in some villages and not in others. Currently all rice farmers in the study area use some fertilizer to boost yields, but almost no farmer removes the most contaminated topsoil to reduce As before adding fertilizer and increase yields for years to come. The researchers will examine the tradeoff between a short-term gain and a long-term gain where the one-time investment cost is paired with varying patterns of future benefits. The observations are expected to establish that soil removal and lowering of As in irrigation water will increase rice yields and protect deep low-As groundwater for drinking. More broadly, the research is expected to provide evidence for policy makers that scaling up the adoption of simple alternative approaches can protect groundwater aquifers."

The human response to this annual flooding, and to its variability over the years, was the major driver of Egyptian history up to the completion of the high dam at Aswan in 1970. This project, a collaboration among historians, scientists, hydrologists, and statisticians, seeks to understand the coupling between the hydrological cycle and human society in Egypt during the Hellenistic era (305 BCE - 30 BCE), a well-documented period of economic, technological and social change with often violent rivalries between major regional powers. The results will also inform our understanding of best-practice responses to the changing climate in the modern world. The project will inform the broad public about human and natural systems and the complex interactions between them at diverse scales, through a traveling exhibition program developed at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. <br/><br/>This project will capitalize upon a rare confluence of natural and human archives for Ancient Egypt and the Near East. By comparing rich historical records (papyrus documents and inscriptions) with environmental data and regional climate and hydrologic simulations for repeated abrupt climate events, the research will determine whether and how social dynamics are climate-driven, and whether and how human water management affects regional climate and hydrology. Volcanic eruptions provide tests of human and natural system sensitivity to abrupt shocks because their repeated occurrence allows the identification of systematic relationships in the presence of random variability. The project will make three important contributions: (1) integrate historical data from a wealth of different archives to analyze the connections between climate variability, social unrest, and institutional change during the Hellenistic era; (2) improve knowledge of hydrological responses to volcanic eruptions; (3) document the extent of human impacts on Mediterranean hydrology. Simulations will be used to evaluate the climatic impact of large and sustained volcanism and intensive regional water management. This historical analysis will delineate the mechanisms through which environmental stress influenced state-level behaviors, community responses (such as changes in land and water management), and interstate conflict during the Hellenistic period, and how in return human activities interactively affected soils, land cover, hydrology, and regional climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use a multidisciplinary research approach to examine these linkages in order to improve the management and forecasting of diarrheal disease in general and particularly in vulnerable dryland systems.  The project will serve as a foundation for a multidisciplinary education program that will strengthen cross-cultural understanding and leadership in coupled natural and human systems research.

The project will examine the coupled natural human dynamics in dryland river floodplains in southern Africa by using advanced sensing, molecular, microbiological, and modeling tools that span multiple disciplines. The study area spans part of Namibia and Botswana in a region where human diarrheal disease outbreaks are coupled to fluvial processes and microbial water quality dynamics. Empirical studies of this dryland river system will be integrated with dynamical modeling of the environmental and human- system components of diarrheal disease. Project outcomes will: i) provide robust empirical data; ii) advance dryland fluvial, soil microbial, and socioeconomic theory and public health policy; and iii) produce generic tools for managing and forecasting the coupled dynamics of microbial water quality and health in other drylands globally."

At the same time, this ""Arctic amplification"" may yield potentially positive impacts on some Arctic industries, such as shipping. Estimates of sea ice extent project an ice-free Arctic over the next century, but more near-term projections are uncertain, notably increasing the risk (and required return) of investments in shipping infrastructure. Despite this uncertainty and the attendant risks, early investments and policy planning are underway for a not-so-distant future in which a transpolar shipping route might be competitive with the Suez Canal. This transformation would have far-reaching effects on shipping costs, global and national competitiveness, the finances of multiple countries, and the deployment of commercial and military assets. Early adopters in Arctic shipping could conceivably bring this future closer:  soot (black carbon) deposited on the ice from local ship traffic has been identified as a contributor to Arctic amplification, since the soot deposited on ice absorbs heat from the sun, accelerating ice melt. This feedback might accelerate the opening of sea lanes, but also increase the year-to-year shipping season variance, increasing uncertainty.  As such, if financial analysts assume sea ice retreats in a predictably linear fashion, they likely underestimate the cost of variation in shipping season length, which may in turn affect investment behavior and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This project asks how risk assessments of Arctic shipping under environmental and geopolitical change can incorporate the risk of amplification from black carbon deposition. To answer this question, the project seeks to understand the reciprocal relationships among ocean-atmosphere-ice dynamics, shipping accessibility, risk-finance-traffic dynamics, and black carbon emissions. Given that uncertainties in sea ice projections are to some extent irreducible, this necessitates a systems approach that can characterize uncertainties. Innovative model simulations of the dynamics of coupling between atmospheric processes, sea ice, and ocean heat transfer will constrain the role of local and global sources of black carbon. Grounded insights on risk management and perception will produce refined estimates of shipping volumes and associated black carbon emissions. The scientific output that will be produced will be disseminated to practitioners and policy-makers in the US and abroad.  The project will additionally, train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers and professionals by running a winter session class for students from the educational institutions involved in the project to help prepare a new generation for a rapidly-changing Arctic and world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will focus on the Lower Mississippi River Basin in Louisiana, which is one of the most vulnerable coasts in the continental United States and the world.  Over the years, this deltaic region has endured multiple threats and disasters, such as land loss, subsidence, sea-level rise, flooding, hurricanes, and oil spills.  The disappearance of land is a critical problem in the southern part of the region. During the past decade, significant population and economic growth has occurred in the northern part of the study area, whereas the southern part surrounding New Orleans has experienced population and economic decline.  A pressing question is whether southern coastal Louisiana reached a tipping point that makes it too costly to sustain.  If so, has the same type of economic and ecosystem functions gradually migrated to the neighboring region to the north?  The researchers will quantify and explain these changes using a coupled natural-human system approach, and they will evaluate the implications of those findings for future planning and mitigation. The four objectives the researchers will pursue are (1) to develop methods to assess the sustainability or resilience of a coastal system; (2) to develop a system-level model to capture and quantify the dynamic linkages among the major natural and human components; (3) to compare and contrast the resiliency between the northern and southern parts of coastal Louisiana so as to understand the resiliency control factors; and (4) to simulate future scenarios for planning and decision making.<br/><br/>This project will assess the sustainability of the lower Mississippi River basin in Louisiana using a coupled natural-human system approach.  It will increase basic understanding about the key factors affecting the sustainability of a coastal system and how these key factors interact at a system level.  The comparison between the two systems in coastal Louisiana will provide new knowledge regarding how the two systems have been coupled in the past that enhances understanding of system interactions in the present and facilitates projections for the future.  The set of sustainability assessment and modeling tools and software developed in this project will be valuable educational as well as decision-making tools for students, other researchers, and decision makers.  The project will engage a wide audience, including K-12 students and teachers from underserved schools, local governmental officials, environmental groups, and the public. Project findings will inform policy makers and the public about how to increase the resilience of the region, and they will provide scenarios to better plan for the future.  The findings also will provide new insights regarding other deltaic regions around the world that are faced with similar types of threats and challenges.

This project will develop a new approach that integrates computer modelling with collection and analysis of archaeological and geological data spanning the last one million years. Computer-generated models will test hypotheses about how various human activities and climatic processes influence environmental changes that can be detected in archaeological and geological data.

The latter provides a framework for understanding how processes that occur over ecological or ethnographic time-scales are reflected in time-averaged fossil archives. This approach, which can be applied virtually anywhere in the world, will be implemented in a study the Cape Floristic Region in southern Africa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and biodiversity hotspot of global significance. Although this exceedingly diverse ecosystem is under increasing threat from modern development, the legacy of human impact stretches back hundreds of millennia. This project aims to resolve the extent to which climatic and anthropogenic impacts have shaped the evolutionary history of this unique ecosystem, including the degree to which ecological functions provided by people are important to maintaining biodiversity.

These issues are of concern to a significant part of the US population, especially along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, that faces persistent flooding and storm damage.  A fundamental aim of this research is to provide knowledge and tools to look further forward in time in responding to coastal and environmental changes. The results will advance knowledge about how beaches and coastal environments react to various storm-related scenarios.  It will also provide insight into how real-estate markets react to complex changes in environmental conditions, public policies, scientific knowledge, and individual attitudes and values.<br/><br/>A technical description of the project<br/><br/>Changing climatic and geomorphological processes are likely to increase risks of living at the coast in the future and to increase the value of reducing those risks through engineering. However, the same factors will tend to elevate the cost and decrease the certainty of the effectiveness of those engineering actions. These dynamics may eventually make it too expensive to continue coastal habitation in its current forms. Coupled choices about modifications to the natural and built environment will determine not only the characteristics of coastal communities but also the nature of transitions to less inhabited or uninhabited states. Natural systems will be represented by state-of-the-art three-dimensional coastal geomorphology models to significantly improve predictions about the way coastal systems evolve over time. The economic system will be investigated through a novel specification of the property markets in two US east coast communities and will be informed by surveys and qualitative research into residents' knowledge of risks and preferences for coastal amenities and infrastructure.  The project will investigate the way that public policies, including government-managed insurance, engineering projects, disaster relief, and infrastructure, will impact both economic decisions and the coastal environment.

Third, the interactions between natural montane systems and human systems extend considerable distances into lowlands, through use of such resources as water and timber. Fourth, different mountain ranges often differ in species and cultures and so provide comparative examples of how coupling between nature and humans works.

Despite the long history of hydropower development in Brazil, the synergistic, cumulative and long-term effects of dams on rivers, forests, and social systems are still undervalued in planning and decision-making. Uncertainty about the social-ecological effects of dam construction is due in large part to the existing piecemeal approach to analyzing the impacts of dams.

Network activities will focus on four critical integrative themes: a) governance and social actors (an overarching and cross-cutting theme that mediates interactions and outcomes in dammed systems); b) watershed hydrology and geomorphology; c) fish and fisheries; and d) land-use/land-cover change.  Focal intersections among these themes to be addressed by the network include feedbacks between hydrologic change and forest ecosystems; human geographic dislocations and land-use change; monitoring and mitigation approaches for Brazilian dams; and the relevance of local knowledge (fishermen, indigenous peoples, riparian communities) for the study and management of systems transformed by infrastructure development.

This approach integrates theoretical calculations to identify probable chlorination products using descriptors for both parent (partial charges, oxidation potentials) and likely product (thermodynamic stability) species. Potential product species are prioritized based on bioactivity (i.e., risk) using high throughput virtual ligand screening.  Once identified, the formation and yield of high risk products are evaluated in bench-scale experiments across a range of chlorination conditions.  High resolution mass spectrometric detection is used to examine wastewaters and receiving waters.

In turn, farmers are altering grazing regimes by increasing herd sizes and expanding pastures, processes that are negatively affecting wetlands. The broader impacts of this project relate to climate change and associated glacial recession, which represent the most important threats to pastoral livelihoods in tropical mountains like the Andes.

An example of an ecosystem service provided by a migratory species is the consumption of insect pests by bats, which minimizes crop damage and agricultural losses. Another example is bird watching and hunting of pintail ducks, which provides people with recreational opportunities. Migratory species spend parts of the year across a geographic range, which often spans political boundaries. Migratory species might provide more benefits to people in certain regions than in others. Additionally, migratory species might receive greater benefits from habitats in particular areas within their range than from others. This could cause a mismatch between the areas where a species provides the benefits and the areas from which it receives support. This mismatch is called a spatial subsidy. Simply put, areas with habitat that provide the greatest benefit to migratory species are subsidizing areas where people receive most of the species' benefits. This can lead to an inequality - between people in areas that subsidize the species versus people in areas that receive the benefits - and to difficulties for wildlife management and habitat protection.  This project will examine the spatial subsidies of an exemplary migratory species: Northern Pintail ducks (Anas acuta). Pintails are an important species for bird watching, sports, and subsistence (food) hunting. Previous studies indicate that breeding habitat in Canada and in the northern continental United States subsidize bird watching and hunting of pintails in California and elsewhere. This suggests that continued pintail hunting and recreational activities are dependent on the conservation of the species' breeding habitats. <br/><br/>This research will develop a model to calculate spatial subsidies in the coupled natural-human systems of the migratory species: Northern Pintails.  Researchers will measure how modeled values of spatial subsidies may influence decision-making related to migratory species in coupled systems in North America.  This model will integrate four components that feed into one another: (1) a Habitat Distribution sub-model; (2) a Habitat Dependence sub-model; (3) an Ecosystem Services sub-model, which (a) valuates ecosystem services, (b) assesses spatial subsidies, and (c) provides decision-makers with modeled scenarios of impacts on services and spatial subsidies to identify how they might alter land-use and conservation actions in response, which is modeled in (4), the Drivers of Change sub-model. Two drivers of change are considered: land-use change, and change in the societal demand for their services.  Finally, this project will also survey agency and NGO decision-makers to determine the degree to which they might use spatial subsidies information in resource management decisions, and conduct a policy analysis of how the spatial subsidies concept might support the objectives of international agreements on migratory species."

The project will provide new perspectives on ways to adapt to and manage human-wildlife interaction.  The project will provide international, interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The investigators will assess conflicts between humans and macaques in southern and southeastern Asia as dynamically functioning, self-sustaining coupled systems.  They will examine how certain combinations of attributes and features (such as human socioeconomic status, human population densities, macaque home range use, and the boldness of macaque personalities) influences the nature, frequency, and diversity of interactions and conflict between humans and macaques.  The investigators will assess how these interactions affect dominance behavior through the imposition of time-constraints on macaques. They will evaluate how these interactions influence human social conflict management as reflected in damage-related transaction costs, and they will examine which aspects of these coupled-systems co-vary within and across human and wildlife systems.  The investigators will conduct a three-year study of six human-macaque systems at three locations in the Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka regions of India and the Selangor region of Malaysia.  They will conduct intensive field-based data collection, including behavioral event sampling of human-macaque interface interactions, behavioral focal animal sampling to record macaque dominance behavior, and GPS coordinates and questionnaire-administered sampling of human attitudes, beliefs, and experiences to gauge human social conflict. The investigators will use both standard regression models and self-developed network approaches to examine the directional flow of dominance information in macaque social networks.  They will employ data cloud geometry to identify higher-order clustering in human geospatial proximity, and they examine patterns in the links between human and macaque systems by using multi-dimensional regression to test specific predictions related to the project's aims.

On one hand, aquaculture promises to fill the gap left by declining wild fisheries and to provide the world with a reliable, affordable form of fish. On the other hand, aquaculture can have negative consequences such as pollution, inequitable distribution of benefits, and ecological impacts on the wild fish harvested to produce fish feed. These tradeoffs are becoming increasingly evident around Lake Victoria. In the face of stagnating wild fisheries in Lake Victoria and a surging human population around its shores, aquaculture may improve food and livelihood security in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. An international team of researchers from three U.S., one Canadian, and three African institutions are investigating the potential for Lake Victoria-based aquaculture and the implications for wild fisheries, global and local supplies of fish, and regional economic development. Researchers will investigate how global demand for fish affects local markets and the fishers who supply them, how the distribution of benefits from aquaculture can be made more equitable, and how building aquaculture facilities in and near lakes affects the ecology and economics of wild fisheries. This work fills a critical gap in knowledge about the links between aquaculture and wild fish, and it will increase understanding of how emerging markets in developing countries can be structured to promote sustainability and equitability. Given links between poverty and political violence, improving food and income security in East Africa will promote development in a part of the globe with strategic importance to the United States. This project will also build technical and analytical capacity at three East African research institutes, train students in socio-ecological systems modeling, and engage a diverse international, interdisciplinary research team.<br/><br/>This project investigates the dynamic links between the ecology of Lake Victoria (a natural system), the economy of its surrounding fisheries (a human system), and the bridge between these systems created by aquaculture. Within the natural subsystem, dynamics of fish abundance are regulated by predation, competition, and lake productivity. Within the human subsystem, dynamics of demand for fish are driven by local fish consumption and global fish exports. The natural subsystem supplies fish catch to the human subsystem, and the human subsystem impacts fisheries through fishing effort. Aquaculture links these systems through additional production of fish and response to demand. This research will investigate the effects of aquaculture on wild fisheries and food commodity markets through an ecosystem accounting model (MIMES) that links lake biological dynamics with human socio-economic dynamics. New environmental, biological and socio-economic data will be collected through trawl, acoustic, and questionnaire-based surveys. New and existing data will be synthesized with GIS. The expansion of a forecasting model (International Futures or IFs) will investigate effects of global demand dynamics on our system. Finally, MIMES will be used to assess scenarios of aquaculture growth and tradeoffs in fish population dynamics, food security, and income security in the Lake Victoria basin."

Residents, businesses and public agencies in megacities respond to extremes in disparate and often uncoordinated ways, and these actions (such as changes in land use and infrastructure) may unintentionally create hazardous conditions in other parts of the city.  The project will produce a dynamic systems model to explore how the individual responses of specific populations to different future scenarios of environmental change may affect one another and produce unintended consequences.  As a decision-support tool, the model will enable decision-makers to test how altering risk-management priorities or adjusting the geographic focus of interventions aimed at dealing with changing climatic conditions could lead to improved overall results. The model will be developed for use in the study locale and would be readily adaptable for reducing risks from changing environmental conditions in complex urban environments across the globe.<br/><br/>The project will be implemented in close collaboration with the National Autonomous University of Mexico City and local stakeholders.  Four case studies of vulnerable regions within Mexico City will be conducted to characterize the complexity of residents' experience of hazards and their response strategies.  City-level analyses will capture the institutional context of decision -making and the mandates, intervention strategies, and priorities of city-level agencies and actors.  A biophysical model will be developed to simulate the impact of land-use change and infrastructure modification on the city's hydro-climatic system.  Agent-based modeling will be developed to simulate the responses of residents and city-level agencies to spatially differentiated hydro-climatic risk, with the outputs from this model linked to the hydro-climatic system.  A geographic information system embedded in a multi-criteria decision-analysis framework will permit the exploration of different scenarios of hazard response in a spatially explicit manner, thereby facilitating decision making concerning adaptation to changing hydro-climatic conditions.

There is good agreement among climate models indicating a warmer and probable drier future for central Texas. As such, the transitional boundary between the humid east and semiarid west is shifting eastward from the 100th Meridian. The major cities of San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, and the Rio Grande Valley are located just east of the 100th Meridian, and rank among the fastest growing regions in the U.S. The state is projected to double in population by the year 2065. The central Texas corridor's position near the climatic boundary makes it particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation. Couple climate change with rapid population and economic growth, and man-made forces become an important driver of future water scarcity in times of drought. It is because of these twin drivers of climate change and population/economic growth that the central Texas corridor can be viewed as a sentinel community; that is, the changes that are currently underway in the region may predict trends for other parts of the U.S. Thus, research will be conducted on climate, population, urbanization and water resources in this region, as it is a valuable proving ground for new techniques and strategies to address water scarcity.<br/><br/>The research comprises: 1) Identifying the Grand Challenges for understanding Texas water resiliency; 2) comparison of 21st century climate model projections at high spatial resolution and improving our understanding of the mechanisms that drive drought in Texas; 3) development of scenarios of demographic changes and regional development for the 21st century in Texas; and 4) integration of the above into a regional evaluation of future water resiliency for the state. New research activities will bring together researchers from complementary disciplines to initiate collaborations and synthesize research activities. The overarching goal of this research is to build knowledge regarding the factors that will impact future water resiliency in the rapidly changing human and natural systems of Texas, which will have applicability to other regions for which significant population growth and changing water availability are projected."

The project will yield a diverse set of products that will have future value in both basic and applied research contexts, including data about migration, livelihood activities, land-use, and adaptation from communities living on a shifting coastline; detailed characterization of the role of land-water governance in shaping both contemporary and historical social-biophysical dynamics within river deltas, and open-source computer models of migration and landscape patterns that emerge in an environment where land is constantly created and destroyed.

As land and economic opportunities are created (and sometimes destroyed) through evolving landscape dynamics, risks from floods and conflicts over land tenure are intensified, forcing community upheaval and migration.  The investigators will use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates household- and community-level surveys, qualitative interviews, collection of sedimentological and geochemical field data, time-series analyses of landscape and institutional change, and scenario modeling.  They will combine established empirical methods in the social sciences and the earth sciences with computational modeling to study coupled dynamics of human activity and environmental change in rural communities living along channels in a low-lying delta, where sediment deposition and erosion create a constantly changing landscape.  The investigators will focus on population movement as a crucial process on the human side of these coupled dynamics.  They will characterize different types of migration as responses to environmental and socioeconomic stress and to opportunities related to changing environmental conditions.  The impacts of migration on livelihood activities, which in turn affect the physical environment through land use, also will be assessed.  With respect to physical systems, sediment transport, and the rates of deposition and erosion will be a central focus, because the creation or destruction of agricultural and homestead land are expected to strongly affect migration dynamics, particularly as changing climatic regimes produce unpredictable precipitation and flooding patterns.  Observational data about the changing biophysical landscape and human activity will be integrated in coupled agent-based and sediment transport models to explore the role of migration as a potential adaptation to climatic stress and as a source of resilience in vulnerable populations.

Zoonoses are a major threat to biosecurity and public health. Bats are home to some of the highest-profile emerging zoonoses, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, and Hendra viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Transmission from bats to humans often occurs when bats abandon natural habitats to take advantage of resources associated with human settlements. This project will investigate how habitat loss causes bat migration into populated developed areas, which leads to increased bat-human encounters and increased disease transmission. The research will focus on Hendra virus, a bat borne pathogen in Australia, to study the interactions among changing landscapes, loss of natural habitats, humans, bats, and pathogens. A surge of bat movement into towns and cities in eastern Australia has led to increased negative bat-human interactions, and increased mortality of horses and humans from Hendra virus. An ultimate goal of the research is to identify and mitigate the specific interacting factors responsible for increased disease incidence and poor health outcomes. The research team includes investigators at ten academic institutions and a non-profit organization. The project will train U.S. students and postdoctoral researchers, improve science communication and policies that protect wildlife and human health, and will build greater research capacity among national and international collaborators. Methods and results will be generalizable to numerous countries in which similar zoonotic events occur, but that have limited resources for biological surveillance, disease prevention, and responding to outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will address the hypotheses that the root cause of negative bat-human interactions is the loss of habitat needed to sustain bats' nomadic feeding ecology, and that some management decisions (e.g., destruction of roost sites, not vaccinating horses) may exacerbate conflict, spillover, and habitat loss. The research integrates theory and field data spanning ecology, physiology, epidemiology, political science, anthropology, veterinary medicine, behavioral ecology, and mathematical modeling. Data will be collected on land-use change and the physiology, energetics, and movement of bats; mechanistic models will be used to examine how the relations among these variables influence bats' use of urban areas. The researchers will conduct field and modeling studies on the dynamics of bat viruses to help predict future instances of virus spillover. They will additionally use narratives, collaboratively produced by researchers and local communities, to conduct experiments on risk perceptions and decisions about bat nuisance, virus spillover, and vaccination. Ultimately, the project will lead to an evidence-based program for reversing the negative human-wildlife interactions that lead to epidemics and loss of wildlife. It will also lead to a framework for public education and engagement that is endorsed by local communities and is embedded in ecological restoration initiatives."

The project is expected to yield insights into a form of dynamic coupling between nature and humans that heretofore has not been studied in depth, one in which policy choices must be made about the relative usefulness of attempts to control either nature or human behavior, or both, in order to reduce harm.<br/><br/>This research project will enhance our understanding of how the dynamic interactions between natural and human systems influence and inform society's choice of public policies for mitigating the economic and public health effects of marine harmful algal blooms (HABs).  The coupled natural-human system of HABs and increasing coastal populations on the Florida Gulf Coast appear to exhibit many of the classic characteristics of dynamic coupled systems, such as feedbacks, thresholds, surprises, and legacy effects.  A better understanding of these characteristics can potentially lead to public policies that are better organized, more informed, less costly, and more effective.  The knowledge gained will inform researchers studying other coupled natural-human systems, thereby opening up other lines of research into coastal and aquatic regions affected by natural hazards around the world."

Three biologists and three social scientists will team up to help answer: (1) How do insect-nutrient relations and livestock grazing strategies interact to affect food prices, food security, and rangeland degradation? (2) How do property rights regimes affect the adaptive capacity of societies to respond to the link between overgrazing and locust outbreaks?  Because both market forces and locust swarms operate over long distances, these effects are likely to be global.  <br/><br/>Locust outbreaks have had devastating effects on food security, impacting crop and livestock yields. This proposal aims to develop new, sustainable strategies to understand and manage locust outbreaks, accounting for feedbacks among ecological, agricultural, and economic systems.

A growing fraction of forest conversion and other land placed into agricultural production is associated with commodities produced for global markets. Much of the demand for food that was historically met by local agriculture is increasingly being met by global trade; in the past three decades food exports have increased 10-fold. This project will quantify and model this type of global scale connection that links natural and human systems by studying how agricultural markets and land use in China and Brazil are linked via commodity trade. The natural environment is incorporated in this model in two ways: first, the local land use choices affect soil quality and water, which in turn affects subsequent agricultural choices; second, the expansion of agriculture into tropical forest has an effect on global climate and biodiversity. The models produced by this project will increase our understanding of how human and natural systems change in concert even when the connections are over great distances (telecoupled). This project is a first effort to quantify complex dynamics of distantly coupled agricultural and economic systems by going beyond the traditional focus on a single system, one-way impacts, or comparative analysis of systems. It represents an exciting new frontier of research in coupled systems, with substantial contributions to the theory, methods, and applications of telecoupled systems. The work is of further importance in providing a broader view and new perspective on international commodity trade, which is in the national interest, and in training the next generation of scientists<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to quantify the telecoupling framework to address fundamental questions about human and natural systems such as: What are the effects of telecouplings on human-nature dynamics across scales in distant systems? How do telecouplings and local couplings enhance or offset each other in terms of their effects on human-nature dynamics?  To address these questions and associated hypotheses, the project will focus on major telecouplings involving the trade of agricultural products (e.g., soybeans for food and animal feed) between Brazil and China, two of the world's most important emerging economies. These two countries constitute an excellent example of telecoupled systems, but little is known about the effects of their rapidly increasing trade on human-nature dynamics. By leveraging existing remote sensing and socioeconomic data and collecting complementary new data, researchers will model complex dynamics and relationships among key components of telecoupled systems. Analyses at the international and national scales will be conducted with the widely used Global Trade Analysis Project model. They will be complemented by in-depth studies at the regional and local scales through ecological fieldwork and socioeconomic surveys, as well as through developing and validating a telecoupled agent-based model.

This research examines how predator species contribute to reducing crop losses in agricultural ecosystems by consumption of crop-eating species, thereby providing an important ecosystem service that increases crop productivity. By learning how to enhance the abundance and activity of predators, agricultural productivity and environmental quality should improve. Strengthening this type of ecosystem service is increasingly important given evidence of negative effects of chemical pest management and consumer preferences for food produced with fewer chemical inputs. This project investigates whether predatory bird populations increase when researchers provide nest boxes in fruit-growing regions and whether the predatory birds in turn reduce crop damage by consuming crop-eating insects, rodents, and birds. Further, the project investigates factors that potentially influence fruit growers' decisions about the use of predator nest boxes, including economic and consumer-preference considerations. The work will result in greater knowledge about the contexts under which humans can enhance ecosystem service delivery. It will provide information about factors that influence fruit grower adoption of management strategies of crop-eating species. Finally, it will document the value of nest-box programs to the conservation of predatory bird species.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the American kestrel, Falco sparverius, a falcon whose prey species damage cherries, blueberries, and other fruits. The work addresses two hypotheses:  1) resource subsidies in the form of nest boxes for kestrels reduce prey activity and abundance and, thus, reduce damage to cultivated fruit and 2) the economics of fruit production, consumer preferences for particular pest management techniques, and kestrel conservation will influence grower decisions about installing nest boxes, and produce positive feedbacks on the growth of nest-box programs in agricultural regions. Researchers will survey abundance and activity of kestrels and crop-eating species, as well as fruit damage, in landscapes with and without kestrels using nest boxes. They will calculate costs and benefits to individual growers and regional economies of utilizing predator nest boxes in fruit-producing regions. The project will use a national survey of fruit growers and in-person interviews, along with modeling approaches, to investigate factors that influence grower adoption of predator nest boxes as a pest management practice.  By integrating information from ecology, economics, and food systems sociology, the project will improve understanding of linkages between natural predator-prey effects, the degree to which humans can manipulate such effects through providing resources to predators, and the potential for factors other than economic ones to influence grower decisions about agricultural practices."

This project will study the system of payments in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve in China, the habitat of the endangered Guizhou golden monkey, Rhinopithecus brelichi.  To assess effects on the ecosystem, researchers will use remote sensing to measure change in forest cover and use camera trapping to measure which forest areas are serving as habitat for golden monkeys.  To assess effects on the local people, researchers will combine existing census data with extensive household surveys and participatory mapping.  Results will show how human populations, attachment to the land, decisions, and livelihoods have changed since payments began, how the quality of the forest has changed, and how these changes in the human and the natural systems depend on each other and are likely to go on in the future.  These findings will assess how well payments for ecosystem services have succeeded at Fanjingshan, show how to assess other systems of payments, and suggest how to improve the effectiveness of payments.<br/><br/>The project will help test and hone an important tool for conservation.

While the transformation of livelihood activities has the potential to improve human well-being, food security, and ecological sustainability, it can also have the opposite effect and increase the vulnerability of the human population and the ecosystems that support them.  In the drylands of Africa, about 100 million pastoralists rely heavily or solely on livestock production for their subsistence. Modernization has brought drastic political and social changes, as well as unprecedented population growth, land degradation and more frequent droughts that decimate herds. Today, many pastoralists are adopting crop agriculture alongside their struggling livestock-based livelihood system as an avenue for much-needed diversification. Such a transformation entails profound changes in the ecological functioning of landscapes, the level of risk exposure faced by households and whole communities, and the authorities and rules governing land use and land rights. Given the complexity and novelty of these changes, assessing the conditions under which social and ecological vulnerability is likely to be alleviated or exacerbated is a profound challenge, but is urgently needed as traditional subsistence-level societies worldwide face similarly uncertain futures.  This research will assess how the transition to agro-pastoralism in two Maasai communities in Kenya is affecting three components of social-ecological vulnerability: the ecosystem's sensitivity to drought and shifting grazing pressure; the degree of risk exposure that households take on as they make the transition; and the coping capacity afforded by the suite of new rules and practices adopted by the communities.  <br/><br/>The approach adopted in this research is based on advances in complex systems theory, which can be applied to ecosystems, human interactions, and governance systems alike.  This approach is also highly advantageous because it enables the use of information about easily-measured, small-scale interactions to understand and predict broader trends such as tipping points and thresholds, which emerge at the level of the whole social-ecological system.   By developing theoretically grounded methods to evaluate multiple dimensions of vulnerability, this research will build transformative links between theory and real-world empirical assessments.  It will directly enhance the ability of scientists to understand and solve other complex sustainability problems emerging around the world.  Through ongoing participation and dialogue, research procedures and findings will be shared with local community members as tools for empowerment and sustainability planning. Cooperative ties with key colleagues in regional academic, development, and conservation communities will ensure that the research tools developed will enhance the approaches and impact of other sustainability initiatives and research programs.

In the face of these challenges, households, communities, and governmental resource management agencies will have to make changes in order to cope; however, strategies to adapt to new conditions will depend on perceptions of climate change, water availability, and how these affect the local agricultural resource base.  Studying the effects of changes in water availability on arid lands and their key stakeholder groups has been particularly challenging because the impacts of climate change and water policy are felt at a variety of scales, including Federal, State, regional and local.  At each scale individuals perceive the changes differently and respond in unique ways shaped by cultural and institutional influences.  This project will examine how various stakeholder groups at different scales perceive climate and water policy changes and how these perceptions affect natural resources and management decisions.  The investigators will examine historical data on climate, water availability, and vegetation, combining this with interviews, participatory GIS, documented water management policies, and historical personal accounts of environmental change and response in order to assess the relationship between measured and perceived environmental change as well as to understand better how people's perceptions shape the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of coping strategies.  By studying the human and natural systems together, the investigators will be able to examine the complex feedbacks between them through time and across spatial scales.<br/><br/>This project will have significant implications for land management, water policy, and biodiversity conservation planning in semi-arid lands and other water-limited environments.  Our empirical analysis will allow replication and model development for other systems or locations to examine the resilience and sustainability of local practices and government policies.  The results of this study will contribute to developing sustainable approaches to coping with variable water availability and policy shifts by helping land managers understand the past and plan for the future.  The results will also contribute to better understanding of the dynamic relationship between climate, water availability, and vegetation communities in the Eastern Sierra region, which will be of interest to land managers developing conservation and range management plans.  Water policy and conservation planning have traditionally been a top-down exercise, ignoring scale, changes through time and from place to place.  This project will generate new knowledge about how environmental perception and response vary with scale and time, and how this knowledge can be used to adaptively manage coupled natural and human systems."

Recent scientific studies show that changes in forests-such as the widespread die-off in the West related to drought, beetle infestations, and wildfires-affect patterns of temperature and precipitation, which in turn ""connect"" through atmospheric processes to agricultural production in other parts of the country. This research will determine the economic impacts of forest die-off across the US on agricultural yields and crop values and will develop a blueprint to manage the challenges of such outcomes. This award will provide decision-makers with the knowledge and tools to better manage natural-human systems in a telecoupled world.<br/><br/>A grand challenge of the coming century is not only to understand the ecological connections between natural and human systems, but also to understand how and when changing ecological conditions can prompt effective governance feedback responses. This research contributes to the body of literature on telecoupled natural-human systems, focusing on the hidden linkages between forests and agriculture in the US. The long-term goal of the award is to provide decision-makers with the knowledge and tools to better manage natural-human systems in a telecoupled world. Changes in vegetation in one location can drive changes in temperature, precipitation, and, subsequently, gross primary productivity in distant locations-a process referred to as an ecoclimate teleconnection. For example, in recent years, California has seen a historic 129 million trees killed across 8.9 million acres, a result of drought, beetle infestation, and wildfire. Via ecoclimatic teleconnections, such large-scale forest die-off may result in telecoupled changes in human systems in distant locations, such as in agricultural yields in the Midwest and related market changes. Specifically, this research will: (1) determine the ecoclimate teleconnections of forest die-off across the US; (2) quantify economic impacts of such changes on US agricultural yield and crop values in key bioclimatic regions; (3) determine the political, institutional, and behavioral factors that may influence decision-makers' ability to respond adaptively to telecoupled forest-agricultural systems; and (4) convene an interactive workshop with decision-makers to present the research findings and to co-produce a blueprint for addressing the governance challenges of such telecoupling. The award will utilize the National Ecological Observatory Network to evaluate the effects of teleconnections between forests and agriculture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project evaluates the impacts of environmental variability on rural agricultural production and how this affects urban food security, and, in turn, how urban population growth affects the demand for local and regional agricultural production, as measured through food trade and other flows. Future challenges lie ahead in terms of meeting urban food demand due to population growth, the changing nature of food consumption patterns, and the vulnerability of both local and regional food production to environmental variability. Globalization and international flows and trade of food and commodities are key aspects of how urban areas will meet future food demand. But urban areas exhibit different levels of connectivity to international, regional, and local food systems. Given complex patterns of urbanization and their differential engagement with global, regional, and local food supply chains, new research is needed to understand what types of urban places are most vulnerable to impacts of local and regional crop production, and what type of urban agglomerations can mitigate those impacts through food imports from distant areas. This project produces a new and transformative understanding of the challenges of maintaining future urban food security and how local, regional, and global food flows affect urban food security under different socio-environmental conditions.  This has implications for national security issues and is of concern for economic development. The project includes educational and stakeholder engagement and disseminates academic and policy relevant materials.<br/><br/>The project uses a novel spatial network approach to model the flow of food within regions and across international borders by analyzing rural food production under recent and projected urban food demand scenarios. This spatial analysis is linked to household survey data collected in urban areas of different sizes and within different geographic contexts to understand how shocks in rural agricultural production affect urban food flows. Household level information is linked to food demand and production information, as well as pricing information. While there has been a considerable amount of research focusing on the drivers and outcomes of rural food insecurity, less work has been done to understand the drivers of urban food insecurity. Additionally, most urban food security research has focused on large metropolitan areas, mostly primate cities, despite the reality that significant numbers of urban residents live in small to moderate sized urban places. This project will make important theoretical advancements in integrated socio-environmental systems research and will make methodological contributions by modelling urban-rural feedbacks and integration and by developing ways of understanding the increasingly important small-to-moderate urban dimension of food security. The research will be conducted in a variety of settings, but the application of the findings is relevant to many urban areas undergoing socio-environmental change, and how this impacts urban food security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project team will develop and test conceptual and quantitative theory that emphasizes feedbacks between humans and the complex ecological systems that support them. The project applies archaeological and paleo-ecological methods to increase understanding of the relationships between initial conditions and subsequent developmental trajectories in the four study socio-ecosystems. This understanding will be used to develop and constrain computational models which will be used to test theories regarding long-term human-ecology feedbacks. The project seeks in particular to integrate the dual roles of humans as subsistence consumers of resources and as market-driven exploiters of resources. The understanding and integrated models will be used to explore the sustainability of people's extraction of biomass (e.g., fish, fiber, fuel, and timber) from complex ecosystems in the context of ecosystem services and environmental change. This work includes three activities: 1) Build a comprehensive network theory of dynamic coupled natural-human systems including their robustness and resilience to external and internal change; 2) apply the theory to, and test it against, the introduction, persistence, and dynamics of Polynesians on four Pacific Islands; and 3) explore how the development and application of the theory might support further advances in our understanding of diversity and complexity and their interactions with ecosystem management.<br/><br/>This project will help us to understand how and why humans succeed or fail to live sustainably within their environment. The research examines four French Polynesian islands where humans arrived about one thousand years ago and lived sustainably on some islands but not on others. Historical and current data will be used to help develop a clearer picture of the social and ecological changes that have taken place since the islands were first occupied. The project team will build and test sophisticated computer models of humans interacting with wild and managed ecosystems. The data and models will help more fully describe and explain fundamental properties such as the resources required by human populations and the ability of ecosystems to provide food and shelter for humans over hundreds of years. They will also highlight interactions between ecosystem services and the human use and exploitation of the islands' resources. Such knowledge is critical to understanding the role of humans with respect to ecosystems and environments well beyond these islands. The project will provide fundamental knowledge about how humans can interact more sustainably and beneficially with a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This work will also demonstrate how environmental and social sciences such as ecology, hydrology, oceanography, archaeology, demography and economics can be integrated to push forward the frontiers of interdisciplinary science. Such advances are vital for addressing critical problems at the intersection of social and natural sciences including resource overconsumption, climate disruption and the collapse of civilizations."

Many landscapes have small natural features that are far more important for maintaining biodiversity or for providing ecosystem services than one would expect based on their size.  Examples include small pools in upland landscapes and coral heads in an extensive bed of sea grasses.  Many landscapes are becoming more urban as communities grow and their development patterns change, so effective management of smaller natural features presents important challenges and opportunities.  The small size of these features often means they can be conserved while allowing activities like development, forestry, or agriculture to continue.  Prevailing conservation strategies do not fully take advantage of these opportunities, however, often because managers have limited scientific knowledge, especially of mechanisms linking ecological and social processes.  In northeastern forests, vernal pools provide a model system in which to study the dynamics of small natural feature management.  Building on numerous ecological and economic theories, this interdisciplinary research project will examine dynamic interactions associated with vernal pools (seasonally inundated wetlands) in forested landscapes of the urbanizing northeast of the U.S.  Their overarching goals are (1) to explore the biophysical and socioeconomic components of vernal pool ecology and management as a coupled-systems model and (2) to improve strategies for conserving vernal pools and other small natural features with large ecosystem service significance.  The investigators will couple spatially explicit ecological and economic models within a dynamic system simulation model to examine the interactions among regulator, community, and landowner decision-making and the resulting landscape impacts on vernal pool species and broader-scale ecosystem functions.  Results from the simulation model will provide information to assess the efficacy of strategies for conserving natural resources.<br/><br/>This project will provide the intellectual foundation for advances in amphibian meta-population theory and microeconomic theories of land use and institutions.  It also will assess the utility of a relatively novel approach for managing natural resources that extends far beyond vernal pools to analogous systems around the globe, from prairie potholes in central North America to desert springs in southern Africa.  By focusing on small natural features with disproportionate significance in urbanizing landscapes, the project will offer insights to help transform the way society approaches resource conservation, especially on private lands. By examining the merits of alternative management strategies, the investigators will provide stakeholders with more efficient and flexible management tools.  They will test these tools by supporting policy experiments on the ground in Maine.  Sharing the experiences of Maine communities with communities throughout New England and eastern Canada as well as with academics and practitioners from around the globe will broaden the impact of these activities.  This project will support and mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and it will facilitate in-service training of teachers from rural and Native American schools.

Fishers are naturally tuned to this complexity and meet their individual goals by targeting their efforts towards particular locations and types of catch, and by adapting their social interactions. Yet we - the scientific community - lack an understanding of how social behavior and ecological dynamics are coupled. Further, these feedbacks are largely ignored in present management approaches. We aim to fill this knowledge gap by answering three questions: (1) How does fisher social behavior (defined as the level to which individual fishers share information) change in response to ecological, technological and management factors? (2) What effect does social behavior have on fisher spatial dynamics and on the social structure of the fishing community? (3) How can management strategies be designed to account for the social behavior of fishers? To answer these questions we will conduct a comprehensive research project involving data gathering and analysis, theoretical modeling and the development of novel mathematical theory. This project will have direct implications for agencies responsible for managing marine resources along the west coast of the U.S. and in Hawaii, some of whom are collaborating in the research. By increasing our understanding of how humans using a natural resource interact with one another and how this in turn affects that resource, the results of this study will be relevant to fields as diverse as finance and global food security. <br/><br/>We propose to gather data on the spatial and behavioral dynamics of fishers along the U.S. west coast, in Brazil and in Fiji - three marine systems with contrasting social, ecological, technological and management characteristics. U.S. data will come from collaborations with the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, and data from Brazil and Fiji will be obtained using economic field experiments. All three data sources will be used to develop agent-based models that simulate both the dynamics of fish and individual fishers. We will distinguish ourselves from traditional modeling approaches by adopting a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) perspective. With a CAS perspective the spatial dynamics of fish and fishers and the social structure of fisher communities, along with other macroscopic properties, emerge from processes operating at low levels of organization, namely the actions of individual fishers and their target species. Our agent-based models will have the CAS perspective at heart, with fisher agents able to adapt and learn different behavioral strategies (e.g. sharing or not sharing information). A combination of variation, fitness and reproduction will create a selective mechanism whereby fisher behaviors converge to evolutionary stable types. We will complement our agent-based modeling with evolutionary game theory and investigate why certain social behaviors are evolutionarily stable in some marine systems and not in others. Last, we will use mechanism design theory to develop management strategies that account for changes in fisher social behavior."

Under optimal conditions, an intact coral reef can provide an abundant supply of food resources to coastal communities. However, overfishing, pollution, environmental change, and economic globalization are currently transforming reefs and the surrounding communities, placing both the health of the reef and the health of people at risk. This research seeks to understand the interactions between coral reefs and human communities. The project seeks to identify effective reef management practices that lead to levels and types of seafood consumption that promote human nutrition. Undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and local inhabitants will be trained in methods of surveying reef health, human health, and fisheries management practices. Through this convergent research, the investigators will develop generalizable principles that can lead to harmonious management of the health of fisheries and seafood-dependent people. <br/><br/>This award will identify the environmental and economic factors that lead to the decline in reef-based food systems. In addition to filling key gaps in our understanding of the human health impacts, this project will advance social-ecological trap theory by empirically testing the extent to which certain feedbacks produce trap dynamics and estimating critical drivers of transitions. To accomplish this, the investigators will dovetail their research efforts with a scheduled socio-economic survey. This project offers a unique quasi-experimental design to study roughly independent and isolated yet culturally similar sites, along a gradient of reef health, market access, and fisheries management strategies. Researchers will collect data on fisheries management approaches and the current status of reef fish and conduct clinical health surveys to determine levels of anemia, obesity, diabetes, and other nutritional disorders that can arise from lacking seafood in one's diet. This award will address pressing questions about the thresholds for reef transitions; the feedbacks between the diversity and abundance of reef-based fisheries; and fisheries activities, management, and consumption.

This project also investigates how ecological changes, disease transmission, risk management practices, and public policy simultaneously affect human activity. Project investigators elucidate how the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in changing landscapes depend on complex interactions between social and environmental conditions. As many vector-borne diseases are expanding their ranges, this project provides public health officials data and strategies needed to anticipate the northward advance of CD, ACL, and other vector-borne diseases. Through collaboration with the Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, this project improves vector-control and disease management policies, with a direct impact on human health. This project provides education and training to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, as well as public health workers, in the United States and Panama. <br/><br/>This research contributes to advancements in the dynamics of socio-environmental systems by integrating disease ecology and social sciences. There has been increasing attention in disease ecology to theoretical and empirical studies of the ecological drivers of deforestation-associated zoonotic disease emergence, while at the same time in the social sciences there is growing knowledge about the economic and cultural drivers of, and responses to, forest change in the tropics. However, there is urgency in synthesizing this knowledge as the range for many vector-borne diseases expands out of the tropics. The investigators integrate social and ecological theory in model-guided empirical research that analyzes co-occurring vector-borne zoonotic diseases, Chagas Disease (CD) and American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL), in dynamic tropical forest landscapes. Using research methodologies from theoretical population biology, field ecology, veterinary epidemiology, and the social sciences, this multidisciplinary team develops a new and transferable framework for representing the combination of land conversion, related human activities, ecological communities, as well as their relationship to vector-borne disease transmission. Data will be gathered using ecological and social surveys, and these will be integrated using a computer model for land use change and disease transmission. The research focuses on three questions: (1) What human and environmental factors determine parasite transmission and human exposure within habitat types? (2) How does the timing and history of land conversion affect ACL and CD transmission? (3) What determines human perceptions and behaviors relating to infection risk across land types? The first question will be answered by determining relative vector abundance (by collecting sand-fly and kissing bug vectors), sampling domestic dogs from households as sentinels for CD and ACL, gathering microclimate data from households and vector habitats, and gathering anthropogenic data from direct observation and household interviews. To answer the second question, investigators will compile and analyze historical satellite imagery, air photos, regional land records, public health records on ACL and CD presence, data on vector habitat distribution, and survey public health officials to determine how human awareness of CD and ACL may change as length of time since deforestation increases. The third question will be assessed using a household survey and data from the local health system, comparing responses to time since deforestation and estimated infection risk from ACL and CD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To fill this gap, ECO-Link is assessing the social and ecological thresholds and feedbacks that influence efforts to manage the invasive North American beaver and restore riparian forests in southern South America?s Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We hypothesize that a current lack of local participation in ecosystem management initiatives is influenced by broken incentive structures that do not account for feedbacks between the underlying beliefs about ecosystem service delivery and their impacts on social well-being. The thresholds that separate inaction from action in environmental stewardship can be overcome by explicitly integrating these underlying beliefs and impacts into to the design of effective incentive programs. We will use a suite of approaches to test our hypothesis by i) studying the perceptions and beliefs of nature held by landowners and other stakeholders, as well as the processes and influences that facilitate or constrain decision-making and action; ii) examining the potential for incentive programs to improve participation in ecosystem management; iii) quantifying associated ecosystem services before and after beaver control and reforestation efforts; and iv) integrating perceptions, incentives, and ecosystem services across a large landscape under various land tenures in Chile and Argentina.<br/><br/>Introduced to the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago in 1946, the North American beaver is responsible for the largest landscape-level change to these southern Patagonian forests since the retreat of the last glaciation. The beaver's expansion has caused widespread deforestation and hydrological changes to entire river ecosystems, and since 2006, Chilean, Argentine and U.S. institutions have been collaborating to confront the issue. It is clear, however, that halting the spread of this ecological damage and restoring watersheds will require a large-scale, integrated management plan involving private and public landowners. Incentive programs are being considered to explicitly encourage behavioral changes in private landowners with the goal of positive environmental outcomes. In Tierra del Fuego, which is shared between Argentina and Chile, understanding local landowners' perceptions of the links between invasive species and ecosystem services is critical to designing an effective program that promotes participation and environmental stewardship across  international institutional boundaries. By focusing on important research questions at the nexus of ecology, culture, and outcomes of management actions, ECO-Link is playing an important role in efforts to restore and protect the southern Patagonian forests of South America?one of the world's most cherished wilderness areas."

The project will provide new insights and information about plant community dynamics before and after restoration and the attitudes, knowledge sources, and perspectives of land managers regarding restoration.  The project will generate new knowledge about interactions between human and natural systems with respect to the influence of ecological variables on public and private land managers' perspectives as well as the influence of land managers' perspectives on the ecological variables.  Project findings will inform land managers about the best practices for restoration and will provide much-needed feedback to restoration scientists about the degree to which their findings are being used and whether anticipated improvements to plant communities are occurring.  Results will be disseminated through regional workshops and trade publications aimed at land managers as well as through scholarly presentations and publications directed toward the scientific community.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Billions of dollars are spent each year to restore degraded river systems around the world.  Research on efforts to restore degraded riparian ecosystems have tended to focus on the interplay between engineering designs and the natural dynamics of water, vegetation, and other natural components of the ecosystem, but very little attention has been given to ascertaining how the knowledge, backgrounds, and motivations of people involved in restoration affect the ecological outcomes of such projects.  The investigators will undertake this project by expanding on a database they previously assembled based on detailed vegetation surveys and environmental parameters for more than 400 sites along streams in the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  They will seek answers to four sets of questions using these natural-system data and data about human attitudes and behavior gathered through the conduct of online surveys and in-person interviews with land managers for each of the sites:  (1) How does plant community structure change as a consequence of restoration?  (2) What aspects of a land manager's background best explain variability in attitudes toward nature and science?  (3) Do elements of the natural environment predict land manager attitudes about science or nature?  (4) Do the attitudes of land managers toward science and/or nature affect the success of restoration projects?  The impact of restoration activities will be measured with comparisons of vegetation over time within restoration sites as well as comparisons among restoration sites and non-restoration reference sites.  The variability in restoration outcomes will be explored using the human-system data, including information about knowledge sources, perspectives on science and nature, and background information, such as education level and level of authority.  Qualitative information from interviews will complement the quantitative data from the statistical analyses in order to ascertain which of many factors are important for describing overall patterns.

Lake Victoria, the largest freshwater lake in Africa, is home to fisheries that contribute to the food and livelihood security of over 40 million people. The introduction of two species of fish, Nile perch and tilapia, has greatly changed the ecology of the lake. While introduced fishes provide income for fishers, they have apparently caused dramatic declines in the abundance of many native species in the lake. One exception is the sardine-like mukene, which supports the largest fishery in the lake and serves as a critical link between the ecology of the lake and the human populations that depend on the lake for food and income. Food security is inherently tied to civil unrest and eastern Africa has been one of the most war-torn regions of the world since the mid-1990s. Martial conflict significantly suppresses fish catch, which harms food security via decreased food availability and loss of livelihood among fishers. Food insecurity can in turn accelerate political violence. This project will investigate how changes in the ecology of Lake Victoria affect food security, and how conflict affects fishing in the Lake.  In collaboration with regional fisheries organizations in Kenya and Uganda, the project aims to a) develop understanding of the relationships between fish abundance, fishery catch and effort, conflict processes, and food security; b) generate estimates of fish abundance using statistical analyses; and c) identify the important links in the system through dynamic structural equation modeling.  Researchers will employ geographic information systems to relate fish catch and effort to food commodity prices in regional markets, and use existing data on the occurrence of conflict to relate prices, conflict, and catch.<br/><br/>These efforts will contribute significantly to understanding the role of natural resources in conflict and conflict effects on local food security.  There is an urgent need to improve understanding of the links between human and natural systems in the Lake Victoria basin. The human population is growing rapidly on the shore of the lake, accelerating impacts on ecosystem services such as water for drinking and irrigation and fishes for food.  This study will contribute to understanding of natural resources and conflict, fisheries ecology, and dynamic modeling of coupled natural and human systems. The project will develop partnerships between U.S. and eastern African scientists and develop the scientific skills of two undergraduate researchers. Moreover, the project will inform sustainable resource management decisions and policies for fisheries that provide food and livelihood security for millions."

The Plateau has increasingly received worldwide attention due its rapid biophysical and socioeconomic changes. Building upon intensive previous work in the region, the purpose of this study is to bring together a multidisciplinary research team to examine and model the changes of the natural and human systems on the Plateau as well as the critical feedbacks between them over recent decades. The project team hypothesizes that while climate change has created pressure on ecosystems and societies in the Plateau, the distinct socioeconomic conditions and development paths of the different administrative units involved have also had a significant effect on the relationships and feedbacks within the human and natural systems. The team will also test the hypothesis that the human influences on the systems exceeded those of the biophysical changes but the significance varies in time, location, and ecological setting. The five major underlying processes studied for the natural systems will include the changes in water fluxes, radiation, soil heat fluxes, primary production, and carbon loss, while the five processes for the human systems are economic growth, population growth, urbanization, technology advancement, and lifestyle change. The system functions and changes will be examined by the life expectancy index, income index, education index, net primary production, evapotranspiration, and ecosystem carbon loss. More importantly, the project team will focus on the relationships between these functions, such as the productivity vs. income index. The connection between the human and natural systems will be viewed through the lens of land use cover and land use change. The progression of causes and consequences will be examined at various levels through three tasks: 1) modeling household behaviors and surrounding ecosystems; 2) studying divergent trajectories for Mongolian systems from past to future; and 3) understanding the vulnerabilities within the system and possible future adaptation strategies toward a sustainable Plateau. The multiple dimensions of the systems will be integrated together systemically, holistically, and across disciplines. <br/><br/>The results of this study will have global implications, especially to this and other regions that are vulnerable to climate and socioeconomic changes. The project will strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration between ecology, economics, anthropology, sociology, and demography and will provide a great opportunity for junior scholars as well as graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research. Data and findings will be disseminated through a series of transformative activities that benefit the people on the Plateau, students in the US, China, and Mongolia, the scientific community, and stakeholders and policymakers worldwide. Recognizing past difficulties in accessing the data for the Plateau, the project team will first develop a comprehensive database that can be shared with the entire scientific community. Intensive training classes and cross-campus courses will be made available through a virtual classroom using state-of-the-art cyber technology to link researchers and students in the US, Inner Mongolia, and Mongolia.

To overcome these limitations, this project will gather data about forest health, human harvesting practices, and climate and other environmental conditions.  The investigators will use these data to examine the dynamics between people and their local environment and to develop a model that can forecast future variation in this coupled natural-human system.  Project findings will provide more generalizable insights for assessing the sensitivity of small-scale socioecological systems to environmental transitions.  This project will inform land management decisions aimed at improving the sustainability of woodland health and human livelihoods under variable environmental conditions.

The research program will specifically investigate the impacts of oceanographic variability on coastal marine ecosystems and human communities of the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico, and the influences of local and global feedbacks on the resilience and adaptive capacity of these systems. Researchers will (1) characterize coastal oceanographic variability and the patterns and drivers of low-oxygen, or hypoxic, events; (2) assess the impacts of variability, particularly hypoxic events, on nearshore species, ecosystems, and fisheries, and compare these impacts with those of past ENSO events; (3) assess the cultural, social, and economic variables that influence the responses of local communities to these impacts, particularly their willingness and ability to invest in local conservation and adaptation; and (4) assess the willingness of selected groups of U.S. citizens to support these local conservation efforts and determine what factors influence such contributions. <br/><br/>As in a number of other coastal regions, the ecosystems and fisheries off Baja California have been heavily affected by extreme events driven by climate.  ENSO events caused significant declines in key resources during 1982-83 and 1997-98, and recent episodes of low oxygen in the California Current region resulted in high mortality of ecologically and commercially important marine species.  A better understanding of the capacity of humans and fisheries to adapt to oceanographic variability will help show how to mitigate the social and economic impacts of increased variability due to climate change and growing pressure on natural resources.  For example, this project will help allow us to anticipate the occurrence and effects on fisheries of low-oxygen events off western North America, and to design marine reserves so as to buffer them.  By examining how the local effects of uncertainty in the ocean can spread more widely in society, the project will lead to broader adaptation strategies. The project will also train undergraduate and graduate students to integrate social and ecological studies, a vitally needed skill in an increasingly crowded world."

This project will measure direct effects of indigenous burning practices on woodlands and low-elevation, mixed forests in the Central Valley, Klamath Mountains, and Sierra Nevada, and indirect effects of these practices on the availability of wild foods and materials used by indigenous peoples that inhabit the woodlands. Researchers will quantify differences in plant species composition between areas burned by local groups of Native Americans and areas subject to fire suppression, and test effects of burning practices on the regeneration of oaks that dominate the woodlands and on infestation of their acorns by insects.  Detailed studies of time required to harvest and process foods and materials such as stems for construction of household items will show whether burning does in fact improve resource availabilities for people.  This work will take a scientific look at a potentially very important interplay between humans and nature that has been the subject of intensive debate but little quantitative study.<br/><br/>The project personnel will collaborate with tribal and other land managers to develop a better understanding of how to manage fire to achieve social goals and to restore and maintain natural systems.

For a variety of reasons, fishing on tropical reefs often targets species of fish that eat seaweeds, and it is thought that reductions in these species can result in growth of seaweeds that eventually replace live coral.  The factors that drive fishing behavior are poorly understood, and can include available livelihood opportunities to fishers as well as their knowledge of and access to fishery resources.  Understanding feedbacks between these components requires accounting for the spatial dynamics of ecological interactions and human behavior.

In most marine systems, basic patterns and interactions between biological and social variables remain poorly understood. This project develops a systems-based model that spans multiple disciplines, including conservation biology, sociology, and political science, to holistically evaluate marine protected area effectiveness.  Oriented towards building a framework to quantify and qualify feedbacks within reef-based, marine, socio-ecological systems, this project focuses on the reciprocal interactions between ecological dynamics, marine conservation strategies, and fishing practices in coastal Madagascar, an island in the process of tripling its marine protected area network. This research examines differences in the marine species richness, abundance, and biomass of a suite of marine organisms between protected areas and control sites. It also draws on both qualitative and quantitative social data to evaluate harvest practices, as well as fishers' perceptions of and participation in marine protected area management. This project contributes broadly to the fields of marine conservation and political ecology and, more specifically, to the literature on protected areas as a fisheries management tool. It also addresses community-based conservation and the role of gender in natural resource management.  Using a holistic analysis that is attentive to gender, class, and race dynamics within a community, this research explores the relationship between community engagement and the abundance and diversity of fish species within each marine protected area.  As a corollary, this research explores the relationship between community engagement and the proportion of shorter-ranging (vs. longer-ranging) marine species fished by a community. This will be the first such study to examine these relationships in tandem. Broader impacts of the work include development of a coupled socio-ecological model of how different levels of community engagement, different marine harvest targets, and modes of harvest influence the ecological effect of marine protected areas and vice versa. It also includes international collaboration with institutions and faculty and students at a university in Madagascar to cultivate relationships between American and Malagasy students, researchers, and key US-based international conservation organizations working to improve marine conservation globally. It will also contribute to the growing body of applied scholarship investigating the link between conservation management strategies and socio-ecological outcomes. Due to its focus on local participation, specifically the role of gendered participation in conservation, this research will illuminate ways in which the application of resource-use rules and regulations, as well as conservation strategies, can be more equitable.

The work focuses on the reciprocal interactions between the ecosystems, community engagement, and harvest practices associated with small-scale fisheries of Madagascar, an island in the process of tripling its marine protected area network.  Drawing on data collected via underwater surveys and quadrat sampling in three regions of the island, including six present marine protected areas and four unprotected control areas, this research compares differences in species richness, relative abundance, and biomass between the two types of areas.  The research draws on both qualitative and quantitative social data through semi-structured interviews and randomized surveys of individuals in coastal villages adjacent to each site concerning harvest practices as well as fishers' perceptions of and participation in marine protected area management.  Using these data, this research parameterizes a coupled socio-ecological model to explore how different levels of community engagement, different harvest targets, and modes of harvest influence the ecological effect of a marine protected area and vice versa.  Due to its unique characteristics, fishing communities in Madagascar form a robust pilot area where there is tight coupling between social and ecological variables.  Local communities harvesting marine species are also engaged in marine protected area management and harvest is spatially concentrated in the reef system adjacent to each fishing village. Similarly, Madagascar is an ideal model system, given the wide spectrum of community engagement in marine protected area management.  Results of the research will not only illuminate processes associated with marine protected areas in Madagascar, but also the complex dynamics of coupled marine fishery social-ecological systems in general. The project contributes broadly to the fields of marine conservation and political ecology and, more specifically, to the use of protected areas as a fisheries management tool, community-based conservation, and gender and natural resource management.  The hypothesis that community engagement is positively correlated with an overall abundance and diversity of fish species within each marine protected area will be examined. In addition, the work will examine whether community engagement is positively correlated with the proportion of shorter-ranging (vs. longer-ranging) marine species fished by a community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers will compare abundances of rare or threatened native plant species and abundances of introduced plants that tend to exclude native species in areas conserved through these different mechanisms. The study will also investigate the factors that determine whether different types of conservation actions are undertaken. The project will use California as the study system, since both mechanisms have been widely employed in the state, and a rich body of data is available. Results will inform conservation policy and help guide future protection of native species in and beyond California.

This project will investigate how reserve design can affect both the natural system within a reserve and the human system outside it, and how these effects can interact to determine the net benefits of reserves to conservation and society.  The research focuses on one of the most basic and variable aspects of reserve design, reserve size; and on protected areas in the deciduous forests of the central and southern Appalachians, an area of high biological diversity and extensive human use.

Savanna fires emit large quantities of greenhouse gases and aerosol particles.  While it is increasing recognized that these fires play an important role in the global carbon cycle, there are few accurate estimates of their emissions and none from West Africa which is that continent's most active fire region. This interdisciplinary research project will develop a model of emission dynamics to determine how emissions change over time by linking changes in the fire regimes to changes in land-use and land-cover patterns.  Available estimates of emissions from savannas contain high levels of uncertainty, because they have been based on very broad generalizations of complex landscapes.  To improve emissions estimates, the investigators will use a new approach to develop a model based on the actual burning practices of people who set fires.  Building on an existing database, they will develop a system to classify savanna vegetation types as defined by fire users and link this classification scheme to fire maps derived from satellite imagery.  These data will be combined with field-based measurements of emissions of key greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane.  These data will be analyzed and combined with data on changes in land use and cover to develop a model of how emissions change over time.  The results of these analyses will produce one of the first accurate estimates of emissions from the heavily burned West African savanna, which will be used to quantify the sources of error in existing emissions estimates. <br/><br/>This project will provide a new model of emissions built on the practices of African fire users as well as one of the first models of fire regime dynamics based on land-use and land-cover changes in Africa.  Project results will be used to predict changes in fire emissions from the African continent, with the new models producing results that will provide valuable and accurate data for those attempting to improve global models of emissions from fire.  The project will yield much-needed local-scale information regarding fire regimes by disclosing those areas associated with high uncertainties in the global-scale models of emissions and by suggesting ways to improve them. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change requires that emissions estimates include an assessment of uncertainties. This project will provide such an estimate.  The project will strengthen research capacities by facilitating graduate research.  It will facilitate collaborative relationships between U.S. and African researchers.  The investigators will help conduct ""fire seminars"" to disseminate results in the study region with the goal of improving local and regional fire management efforts that are currently hampered by a lack of data.

These systems are designed to be adaptable to a wide range of supply and demand conditions. However, climatic and social shifts are placing new stresses on water-supply systems that require substantial changes, also called transitions, to maintain system performance. This research analyzes transitions across 12 large-scale urban water systems in the United States to achieve two goals: 1) to better document the interactions among various environmental and human factors that may prompt transition, and 2) to identify which infrastructure and policy design choices can foster practical transitions to increase sustainability. To accomplish these goals this project will gather and analyze long-term human and environmental data to synthesize relationships and trends, and develop two complementary models to identify pathways that can lead to a sustainable water-supply transition. This project will directly involve stakeholders in multiple stages of the research to both learn from their experiences and ensure that outputs meet their needs. This project also will provide education and training opportunities to help students develop the competencies needed to collaborate across fields, a skill that is essential to tackle current environmental challenges. <br/><br/>The proposed research utilizes a ""convergence"" approach to investigate how integrated urban water systems can be managed effectively as they face increasing pressures from climate change, population growth, and other environmental factors. This research will involve a longitudinal analysis of system stressors, an examination of hydrological detection and change, construction of a Bayesian model to forecast the probability of stressors exceeding thresholds for transition, and development of a dynamic model to identify promising design choices. This project will benefit urban water-supply systems in four ways by: 1) combining institutional analysis with dynamic modeling to gain new insights into the role of institutions in shaping system dynamics; 2) linking the detection and attribution of hydrological change to watershed and policy processes, which will result in new knowledge about the drivers and the impacts of hydrological change; 3) synthesizing quantitative and qualitative data, stakeholder knowledge, and inductive and deductive modeling approaches to enhance system performance; 4) identifying how specific infrastructure and institutional design choices affect system resilience and transition probability. Knowledge relating design to outcomes is key because, although cities cannot control the dynamics of hydrological or human systems, they can alter design choices. Examining urban water transitions can also offer general insights for other socio-environmental challenges where preemptive intervention will be beneficial.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Food production set the stage for virtually all subsequent cultural developments. Coincident with these changes was the rise of cultural selection replacing natural selection as the determining force in the ecology and evolution of plant and animal species. Food production was tightly tied to climate and drought and significant changes in these factors often resulted in disruption of production and cultural collapse. This award investigates the origins of food production in the tropical lowlands of Belize, Central America occurring from 3000-6000 years ago and the ecological and cultural response to a three-century drought that began 4200 years ago. Climate modeling, environmental reconstruction and archaeological inference of human adaptation will be used to evaluate the long-term relationships among these factors and changing socio-environmental dynamics. This study will provide insights to the experience of thousands of generations of human responses to environmental change and potential guidance so that future generations can be more resilient to major environmental changes. This research is transformative in advancing basic understanding of interactions between how human populations feed themselves and tropical forest ecology in response to profound environmental change. <br/><br/>This award will examine how drying environmental conditions affect human subsistence practices and how intensified food production, in turn, affect local vegetation patterns. Food production is one of the most significant developments in the history of the human species and as the determining force in the evolution of a select number of plant and animal species. Food production has long been acknowledged as setting the stage for virtually all subsequent cultural developments by increasing the carrying capacity of land, the degree of sedentism that is possible as well as greater population density. As a result, the production of food was a required prerequisite for the establishment of urban life. Food production is also necessary to underwrite the division of labor within society that allowed farmers to support ever-increasing numbers of non-producers such as political rulers, priests, engineers and scientists. Environmental change is often posited as resulting in cultural collapse. The reconstruction of human occupation and forest floral species diversity in the tropical lowlands of northern Belize, Central America will be reconstructed from 6000-3000 year ago to document how food production and settlement patterns were affected by climate change and, in turn, how local vegetation was reconstituted. This reconstruction will be accomplished by combining archaeological excavation that document human habitation and lake sediment coring to reconstruct changing patterns of plant pollen from economically useful species and charcoal that result from human burning of local vegetation to increase soil productivity. Research will focus on the ""4.2 ka BP event"" that caused three centuries of climate disturbance world-wide between 4200 and 3900 years ago. Evidence of human settlement patterns and diet from before, during and after this period will be used to evaluate paleoecological evidence of changing species availability and the extent of anthropogenic disturbance through the use of fire. Evidence of human settlement patterns and diet will be evaluated in light of expectations of niche construction theory (NCT) and optimal foraging theory (OFT) and related to evidence of changing species availability and the extent of anthropogenic disturbance on the landscape with fire.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasingly urban trees are called upon as a form of living (i.e., green) infrastructure that is used to meet a variety of municipal goals to provide ecosystem services and combat the effects of climate change that, for many cities in the US and abroad, is causing an increase in the urban heat island effect. However, using trees as a form of infrastructure raises new challenges compared to traditional gray infrastructure typically managed by cities. This research addresses major knowledge gaps in our understanding of the effectiveness and capacity of urban trees to provide the services expected within the structure of municipal tree planting, stewardship and decision making and community interaction. Living infrastructure is a socio-environmental-technological system of feedbacks between organisms, the environment, societal desires, and governance capacity. In the case of urban trees, their capacity to meet municipal goals is uncertain and likely varies among cities. Part of this uncertainty exists because the ability to adequately model the effect of urban trees on their local environment suffers from a lack of quantitative information and scientific study. At the same time, the capacity of institutional managers to successfully steward urban trees is also unclear. Taken together, cities may have goals for tree-derived functions that are disconnected from both the biophysical realities of what trees can do and realities and limitations of community management practices. Broader impacts of the work include student and postdoc training in convergent research, providing data and findings to inform municipal decision making, and informing the public and other stakeholders of the role of living infrastructure in cities via social media and other outreach mechanisms. <br/><br/>This is a pilot project with an overarching goal to understand the intellectual and institutional factors that have driven the movement to use urban trees as living infrastructure to produce ecosystem services. Project activities will evaluate the capacity of municipal institutions to implement and manage urban trees as living urban infrastructure to achieve climate goals. The project addresses key uncertainties in the socio-environmental system that considers urban trees as living infrastructure. It will examine how existing municipal forestry goals and plans vary throughout the United States, and how municipalities currently frame the role of living infrastructure in climate mitigation and adaptation. It also examines how current scientific understanding aligns with these goals and what information is needed for monitoring, modeling, and validation of these processes. the project includes the evaluation of existing municipal urban forestry plans from 20 cities throughout the United States. Data will be evaluated from the different disciplinary perspectives: i.e., ecosystem science, community ecology, ecohydrology, cultural geography, engineering, and landscape architecture. These data will be complemented with additional data collection and stakeholder interviews at three focal research cities: Los Angeles, California; Phoenix, Arizona; and Baltimore, Maryland. Work packages include a whole-team 1- to 2-day synthesis meeting in each of the three focal cities where existing data will be examined and discussed by the group. This will be followed by a half day workshop that engages local stakeholders. Meetings will focus on addressing research questions and further elaborating the coupled socio-environmental theory of living infrastructure. A Technical Advisory Committee will be constituted and their input on stakeholder decision making will be incorporated into the work plan. This effort will substantially contribute to a more comprehensive theory of living infrastructure as an interface between social, environmental, and technological systems and as a key component of novel urban ecosystems that can vary dramatically at national scales. Societal benefits of the project include the direct dissemination of our research findings to urban land management and forestry professionals, and new interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral and undergraduate trainees.

This project explores the potential for adaptive social networks of actors in fire-prone regions to improve their ability to cope with increasingly large and intense wildfires. This is achieved first by exploring and summarizing key adaptation lessons from four western US study areas and vetting them via a stakeholder council. Next, the most promising social network structures from these study areas are tested in a well-documented focal area, where many alternative futures are simulated under widely varying future climate scenarios. A stakeholder council is then convened with leading national and state wildfire learning networks to distill, consider, and disseminate findings with the participation of young, next-generation science leaders. Finally, the entire approach is captured in a first-of-its-kind computer model, extending and sharing the tools so that others may use them to expand adaptation efforts elsewhere. Lessons and outcomes will be disseminated to create more resilient landscapes and communities in the face of increasing wildfires through collaborative engagement with students, educators, stakeholders, policymakers, and resource managers.<br/><br/>This project explores how social network topology shapes the ability of communities in regions affected by wildfires to adaptively reorganize in response to fires that are more severe than people have previously experienced. The main goal is to identify replicable network building blocks that can enhance adaptive capacity in a variety of fire-prone landscapes. Once these network structures have been identified, they are used to validate an innovative computational platform linking adaptive social network, biophysical, and agent-based simulation models. The modeling system is then applied in dynamic, mapped representations of the focal area landscape and its wildfire actors (e.g., landowners, organizations, and policy makers) to test the limits of different social network topologies to respond to intensifying wildfire regimes. Together, these efforts enable (1) the creation of a generalizable theory of when, where, why, and how adaptive changes arise through social network reorganization in wildfire-prone social-environmental systems experiencing intensifying fire regimes; 2) the synthesis of empirical and modeling insights to distill representations of people's and organization's relationships that increase adaptive capacity with respect to wildfires; and 3) exploration and testing of how the identified relationships may evolve over time under projected future disturbance regimes to alter adaptive capacity and constrain risk in relation to wildfires.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ecological component will apply Bayesian modeling and mixed statistical-process modeling to global datasets on plant functional trait distributions and biodiversity in order to estimate the effect of climate change on ecosystem processes and species distributions, from which species extinction risk can be derived. A parallel economic component will investigate the economic costs of these changes. This component has two parts: meta-analyses of ecosystem service valuations to estimate the ecological and socio-economic determinants of the value of multiple ecosystem services; and a social revealed preference approach using species-level spending under the Endangered Species Act to place a lower-bound on the costs of extinction risk. Findings from the ecological and economic components will be integrated to produce country-level damage functions that will be introduced into cost-benefit IAM models to determine implications for marginal climate damages that can serve to inform environmental policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mercury is an environmental pollutant that can travel far from its emission source, where it can damage human health and the environment. ASGM is estimated to be the largest source of global mercury emissions, and occurs in the context of power, race, and gender dynamics in mining communities. A better understanding of the multiple, interacting factors that influence mercury use in ASGM will help advance knowledge about the atmospheric mercury system and support governance efforts to address environmental and human health risks from mercury pollution. The project will develop and evaluate a new theoretical framework that can be employed to analyze interactions of people, technologies, and the environment that can contribute to sustainability transitions. The project's broader impact will be to inform initiatives to mitigate environmental and social harms of ASGM activities, including those under the global Minamata Convention on Mercury. Project participants will engage with organizations, NGOs, those affected by mercury contamination in communities, and other experts to translate findings to practical action. <br/><br/>This project uses the perspective of an integrated human-technical-environmental system to analyze mercury use and human well-being with a focus on artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Peru's Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. Mercury poses substantial risks to human health, both locally and through long-range transport, and ASGM is estimated to be the largest source of mercury to the global atmosphere. Mercury use and ASGM is also accompanied by a range of other social and environmental problems. The project will develop and evaluate a new theoretical framework based on a human-technical-environmental systems approach, and refined methods for bridging quantitative and qualitative systems analysis. The project asks the following questions:  Q1) How much mercury is emitted to the atmosphere from ASGM, globally and regionally? Q2) What are the main multilevel governance needs and options to support reduced mercury use and improved human well-being in the ASGM sector? Q3) How do ideas about mercury and pollution in the context of power, race, and gender affect prospects for sustainability transitions in ASGM regions? Q4) What frameworks can be used to better understand the links between ASGM and sustainability, and measure progress towards improving miners' well-being? The project deploys multi-disciplinary research methods, including atmospheric chemistry modeling, governance research methods, and ethnographic methods. It applies a systems framework using a matrix-based approach linking quantitative and qualitative analysis. The matrix approach will classify system components, map interactions among these components, and identify key points of leverage in the system. All four questions and research methods will be refined through coordination with local and international stakeholders. The project results will contribute to the broader field of sustainability science through developing frameworks and insights to assess integrated social-environmental systems. The research will also contribute to the areas of atmospheric chemistry (through novel inverse approaches and better constraints on mercury emissions), governance research (by contributing to theory and empirical analysis of multilevel governance), and political ecology and environmental anthropology (through a better assessment of complex social relationships related to natural resource extraction). Societal benefits include informing efforts, including under the Minamata Convention on Mercury, to mitigate environmental and social harms of ASGM. Students will be trained and involved in interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research methods, and related case study materials will be developed for teaching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumers have growing interest in supporting sustainable and environmentally friendly food and energy production practices. They will consider paying more for products that contribute towards cleaner air, water, and natural environments if they can be assured sustainability goals are being met. Farmers and suppliers are also interested in improving field-to-market supply chains. Advances in information technology and computational systems could allow farmers and suppliers to keep track of their practices in ways that consumers can incentivize. Blockchain networks are a computational approach to securely storing and sharing records that could fill this role. However, our scientific understanding of how blockchains could work to increase consumer awareness of sustainable products, incentivize farmer participation in sustainable practices, and lead to a dynamic system with long-term environmental benefits is limited. This project will evaluate the feasibility of blockchain networks to connect farmers to consumers and thereby increase agricultural practices that improve sustainability. Broader impacts from this study will include the development of fundamental mechanisms and metrics for the design and prototype of blockchain networks in agricultural and other industries. Curricular materials will be developed to educate K-12 teachers and underrepresented minority students on the engineering aspects of blockchain networks to better prepare them for future technological advances. Additionally, these materials will be incorporated into the People in Ecosystems Watershed Integration (PEWI) model for use in K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>The project will develop a framework for blockchain networks that connects farmers and suppliers to consumers in a field-to-market supply chain. The framework investigates optimal blockchain network designs in terms of economic cost, accessibility, energy use, and information efficiency. Some of the factors that will be considered include the network structure, the information storage medium, and the transaction model. The optimal design will also account for consumer and farmer acceptance to encourage broad participation. The driving hypothesis is that consumers will be willing to pay higher prices for products when the incentive can be traced directly to the original supplier. The findings could lead to novel approaches for developing market-driven incentive systems that empower consumers to support sustainable practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is no Lyme disease vaccine available for humans, so the only prevention options are to reduce the number of ticks infected with the bacterium in the environment and to reduce human contact with ticks. To help develop these prevention methods, our study will simultaneously investigate how the ticks and the bacteria are dispersed and survive in the environment and where people are encountering the ticks, whether in their own yards or in the natural areas they visit. We will use state-of-the-art technology to monitor deer movement by GPS and human movement using a smartphone application. This will be the first study in the United States to focus on tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces, where dense human populations co-exist with urban wildlife that disperse ticks and the microorganisms they carry. A multidisciplinary team of ecologists, epidemiologists, social scientists, and economists was assembled to investigate this complex system. By engaging with the community in a ?citizen science? approach, the researchers will better understand people's knowledge, actions and motivations in relation to tick-borne diseases; educate people on proper protection methods; and provide recommendations to reduce the individual and community risk of Lyme disease. The project is led by two Hispanic females and will build the community of interdisciplinary scholars ready to tackle socioenvironmental systems research, including two postdoctoral researchers, one PhD student, and more than five Master's and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The research team hypothesizes that tick-borne diseases act as an integrated socioenvironmental system in which environmental- and human-associated drivers reciprocally influence each other. Central to the approach is the assessment of the relative contributions of ecological and human behavioral factors to increased Lyme disease incidence, with a focus on urban landscapes. Because of the aggregated nature of risk in urban areas, the study units will be 'ecological neighborhoods', each composed of an urban park on Staten Island, New York City and the houses around that park. The researchers will first study how the movement of deer and the abundance of other animals result in differential dispersal of ticks in parks across Staten Island. Then, they will explore how features of the backyards surrounding the parks influence their attractiveness to hosts carrying ticks and the survival of ticks after they drop off from hosts. A smartphone app will provide information on people's movement and exposure risk. The research team will also conduct surveys to assess people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tick-borne diseases and identify risky behaviors and avoidance practices. By integrating these data to inform agent-based models, the team will identify optimum combinations of interventions at the level of the individual, community, and city. These 'integrated tick management' approaches will be provided to policy makers to better target public health interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Protected areas also provide important health and economic benefits to human communities, for example, through outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism. Visitation to protected areas is thought to be associated with public support for conservation; in other words, people will not care about protected areas, or the wildlife that depend on them, if they do not visit them. This project will test the hypothesis that visiting a protected natural area leads to pro-conservation behaviors, or people engaging in specific actions that lead to successful conservation of ecologically-important lands and species. The researchers will collect in-person and web-based survey data from visitors to Adirondack Park in northern New York, and field data on the effects of visitations on the park's bird communities. Results of the project will increase our understanding of how visitor activities affect biological communities, how changes in biological communities affect protected area integrity, how protected area integrity affects visitor experiences, and how visitors' experiences affect their conservation related behaviors. This research will provide training and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and will inform policies to manage protected lands and wildlife. Outreach engages citizen scientists and includes public seminars, meetings with land and wildlife managers, and press releases to media outlets. <br/><br/>Using an integrative socio-ecological approach and experimental treatments, the project will investigate the dynamic human-environmental interactions that result from people's visitation of protected areas.

They will conduct social surveys to assess the effects of visitor activities on place attachment and ecological literacy, and subsequently, on intentions to engage in pro-conservation behaviors. These social surveys will be paired with field surveys and geospatial analyses to document multi-scale ecological integrity of bird communities in relation to varying intensities of human activity.

Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) can carry several diseases shared with humans, known as rat-associated zoonoses, such as leptospirosis, Seoul hantavirus, and bubonic plague. Rats also cause billions of dollars in property damage annually. In addition to physical health risks, chronic exposure to rats and their associated property damage can act as a mental health stressor for residents. A better understanding of what processes increase the risk of disease and mental health impacts from living with rats will help improve public health in cities around the world. While little is known about urban rats, the risks associated with rat infestations are often disproportionately high for low-income communities, likely due to fewer resources to maintain infrastructure and control rodent populations. Income disparities between neighborhoods is especially pervasive in Chicago, Illinois, the city with the most rat complaints per capita in the United States. This combination of high rat encounter rates and income disparities in Chicago likely creates further inequities in resident exposure to rats and disease risk. Frequent negative experiences with rats may also influence resident attitudes toward other species of urban wildlife. For example, strong negative attitudes about rats may be associated with negative attitudes about similar native species such as squirrels. Understanding the relationships between human attitudes about rats and other wildlife will help to mitigate any eroding effects of wildlife pests on public support for urban nature conservation.<br/><br/>The aim of this award is to understand how to mitigate public health risks from rats and advance urban conservation by studying the interactions between urban residents and brown rats (Rattus norvegicus). The specific project goals are to: 1) quantify the impacts of rat infestations on the physical and mental health, attitudes, and approaches to pest control of socioeconomically diverse urban residents; and 2) quantify the impacts of pest control initiatives on rat population dynamics, rat disease ecology, and urban predator health. To achieve these objectives, the research will integrate data on rats, predators (i.e. cats), and residents in Chicago neighborhoods that vary in household income. Interviews and surveys will be used to collect data on resident experiences with rats, mental and physical health, and attitudes about rats and other urban wildlife species. In the same blocks, citizen scientists will trap rats and collect fecal samples from free-living cats. This data will be used to relate local rat abundance and rates of infection with corresponding resident experiences and attitudes about rats. Local rates of rat infection will be evaluated with respect to resident experiences with zoonotic pathways such as being exposed to rat feces or urine. Predictive models will be developed to identify the socio-ecological contexts in which risk from rats is highest. To simultaneously quantify the impacts of rodent control activities on wildlife population health, the research will test whether rodent control through chemical rodenticides is associated with changes in the genetic diversity of rats and higher infection risk for Escherichia coli in both rats and free-living cats. The proposed project will be the first to quantify the feedbacks between humans and rodent pests and will advance ecological and public health knowledge applicable to cities around the world. Further, the project will provide societal benefits by improving public health, social justice, and support for urban nature conservation while providing special education and training opportunities in field research for urban and minority students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For savanna ecosystems worldwide, an important ecosystem service is the production of forage for consumption by domestic livestock.  While this form of resource extraction often is thought to conflict with the conservation of wildlife, recent evidence suggests that livestock and wildlife may sometimes improve forage quality for one another.  In addition, recent research suggests there may be an additional benefit to the integration of livestock and wildlife in savanna ecosystems:  control of ticks and tick-borne pathogens that affect wildlife, livestock, and human health.  In the Laikipia District of Kenya, preliminary evidence suggests that the presence of cattle treated with acaricides (tick-specific pesticides) greatly reduces the abundance of ticks in the environment.  For both livestock ranches and wildlife conservancies, this finding offers a potential management tool with important implications for the control of parasite populations that may threaten economic benefits from both wildlife ecotourism and livestock production.  Ticks and tick-borne pathogens are only one of many factors that influence human well-being in savanna ecosystems, however.  Despite great interest in the sustainable management of ecosystems, many of the services most critical to rural well-being, such as those that contribute to agriculture and livestock production, are missing from existing measurements of ecosystem services.  In order to understand how diverse biological and social phenomena interact to determine human well-being within savanna ecosystems, this interdisciplinary research project will use an integrated approach drawing from expertise in the ecology of infectious diseases and modeling of ecosystem services to better understand the interactions between all of the ecosystems services generated by savanna ecosystems that influence human health and well-being.  The researchers will experimentally manipulate the distribution of an ecological trap (acaricide-treated cattle) to rigorously assess the consequences of management strategies for tick abundance and forage quality.  They will evaluate tick abundance and forage quality on ranches with a suite of replicated approaches to cattle and wildlife management, and they will develop simple production function models of this coupled natural-human system that capture forage-livestock-wildlife interactions, contributions of wildlife to tourism visitation and income, contributions of livestock to income and human nutrition, and wildlife-livestock-tick interactions that determine tick-borne disease risk.  They also will employ production function models through scenario analysis to explore the consequences for wildlife and human well-being of different management strategies across the Laikipia District.<br/><br/>This project will integrate social and ecological approaches to advance understanding of systems in which the health of humans and nature are strongly interconnected.  This project will experiment with a novel approach to parasite control that may yield numerous unintended benefits, and it will be among the first projects to attempt to assess the value of multiple different ecosystems services within a common ecosystem.  The project will provide diverse educational opportunities for both U.S. and African students and scientists.  The project holds promise for yielding significant benefits for society by characterizing the elements of potential win-win scenarios between natural and human components of an ecosystem, with positive ramifications for livestock husbandry, wildlife conservation, livestock and wildlife health, and human income, nutrition, and well-being.  Project findings will have utility in other regions with similar socioecological contexts, possibly providing a new model for the sustainable management of coupled natural-human systems.

Existing freshwater resources are being challenged by increasingly unsustainable land use and water use practices. The distribution, abundance and quality of freshwater supplies will undoubtedly also be affected by projected climate change and variability. Unless landscapes are managed proactively in the future, sustaining even the present level of ecosystem goods and services that aquatic systems provide will be impossible.  Among the most pressing environmental challenges related to freshwater are how to formulate and implement sustainable, science-based, strategies to adapt to climate variation, land use change, and other consequences of human development.  To address this challenge, we will develop an integrative mechanistic model accounting explicitly for human-landscape interactions. Our coupled human-landscape model incorporates linkages and feedbacks among atmospheric, terrestrial, aquatic, and social processes to predict the potential impact of climate variability, climate change, land use, and human activity on water resources at decadal to centennial scales in the Central Great Plains region of North America. This part of the United States has longstanding water quality and quantity concerns resulting from extreme climate variability, intensive water uses and land uses.  Furthermore, the regional socio-economic system is challenged by dramatic population shifts, concentration of land tenure, dependency on highly variable and limited water supplies, economic uncertainty, and strong cultural resistance to top-down government regulation. Both human and natural systems in this area depend on adequate freshwater for survival, but are fragile, quickly and dramatically affected by climate fluctuations, and potentially facing disaster given either natural or anthropogenically-driven climate scenarios. In the first three components of the project, we develop and interactively couple mechanistic models of the three systems controlling water supply and water quality ? the hydrosystem, the aquatic ecosystem, and the human system. In the fourth research component, these three system models are integrated in two ways. First, we use an agent-based decision model to evaluate wholesystem (hydrosystem, aquatic ecosystem, human system) response to climate variation scenarios derived from historical climate data and downscaled climate projections. Second, we use policy optimization modeling to identify the most effective strategies to achieve sustainability within a culturally appropriate context. <br/><br/>This research will produce benefits to society by providing tools and frameworks that will guide policy formulation and implementation of incentives and regulations to ensure the sustainability of coupled hydrological, ecological, and human systems in the Central Great Plains and beyond. Our research has the potential to transform the science supporting water sustainability efforts on several fronts. Specifically, our research will: (a) improve our ability to translate climate model outputs into more understandable and relevant weather-scale events ; (b) produce a better understanding of how and why landowners make water-use decisions; (c) develop a spatially-explicit, landscape-scale synthesis of existing ecological data to understand how climate changes and watershed alterations impact riverscape-scale biodiversity, (d) facilitate understanding of how climate change will act in conjunction with and exacerbate a range of other stressors to impact the functions of wetlands, and (e) produce a usable  policy optimization model to help governments move towards societally acceptable and achievable water sustainability. These advances will directly contribute to the sustainability of economically important agricultural systems, biologically significant ecosystems, urban population clusters, and clean water supplies."

In these flat plains, there is a strong, two-way coupling between climate, soil water, and land use. Groundwater is close to the surface, tightly associated with surface water and climate, and can have either positive or negative impacts on natural and human systems depending on its depth. For instance, shallow groundwater can provide a useful backup that stabilizes crop yields when precipitation is low, but also may trigger massive flooding events if it reaches the surface. Conversely, land use (e.g., crops vs. pastures) can have a strong effect on the quantity and quality of groundwater, as vegetation influences groundwater recharge through evapotranspiration and drainage. The project is assembling a linked modeling framework to explore the interactions between surface and ground water, plausible climate scenarios (e.g., wet or dry periods), and individual and land use decisions. This framework combines (i) a physically-based hydrological model, (ii) biophysical crop growth models and (iii) an agent-based model of land use decisions and farm production. The linked models are used to explore the outcomes of decisions (e.g., land allocation) that balance economic and agronomic considerations (profits, crop rotations) with management of flooding and drought risks by maintaining the depth of groundwater within desirable limits; these decisions are embedded in the context of uncertain future climate. <br/> <br/>Water to produce food currently exceeds all other uses. In the next decades, climate variability and change will pose serious challenges to water availability and demand in agriculture and, consequently, to global food security. The tight coupling between climate, land use, and soil water in the flat Pampas offers a unique opportunity to study feedbacks between hydrological and ecosystem processes, and how these are influenced by human decisions. To deal with decision-making under ambiguity in future climate and socio-economic conditions, the project explores approaches that assess how multiple risk management strategies perform over a wide range of climate and socio-economic scenarios. The emphasis is on finding strategies that will perform relatively well across most future conditions, even if we do not know precisely what those futures will be. By exploring the outcomes of strategies under multiple plausible futures, stakeholders can identify vulnerabilities and design adaptation mechanisms to cope with change. The complex two-way dynamics of shallow groundwater in flat plains set up another interesting social science problem: flood and drought risks faced by a farmer are influenced not only by his or her own decisions, but also by those of others nearby. This so-called ?interdependent security? problem requires coordinated action by neighboring farmers to manage groundwater levels and associated risks. This project will address the challenge of understanding the conditions that encourage informal or formal cooperation in such situations."

These pollutants, termed ""Atmosphere-Surface Exchangeable Pollutants"" or ASEPs, are emitted to the environment through human activities, are transported and ""processed"" in the environment, and are then deposited where they may harm humans and wildlife, often in locations distant from their original use or release.  Incomplete understanding of the dynamic behavior of these pollutants in the environment has resulted in efforts to regulate them that do not fully protect human and ecosystem health from risks.    The human system, including sociopolitical activities, cultural  perspectives, and socioeconomic activity resulting in emission of the pollutants into the environment and other environmental stressors, the biogeochemical cycling of the pollutants in the global environment, and the impairment of ecosystem services that  result from this cycling comprise the coupled  human-natural system of study. The objective of this study is to probe the complex dynamics and feedbacks within the system and to identify critical social adaptations and governance advancements required to address the challenges to sustainability posed by these chemicals.   Because emissions of these pollutants occur throughout the world and they tend to move northward in cycles of re-volatilization and deposition, resource managers face a particularly difficult challenge in addressing concerns related to this form of contamination. To identify ways in which the regulation of these chemicals can be improved, simulate their global transport will be simulated under differing future climate and land cover/land use scenarios to estimate amounts sequestered in and re-emitted from ecosystems.

The characteristics of atmosphere surface exchangeable pollutants lead to a separation in space and time between use and harmful impacts. These pollutants are released into the environment through human activities that yield economic benefits, but the economic costs of damage to human health and environmental impacts are often borne by other segments of society. Because the chemicals cross political boundaries, efforts to address any concerns are complex. The project team will examine details of the environmental cycling of these pollutants (how, where and when they cycle between the air and the Earth surface) that currently impede our ability to model their global transport and fate, and thus inform policy decision-making. They will also assess the economic damages caused in the United States by these pollutants.   By studying the coupled human natural system involving these chemicals, this project will improve our understanding of sustainable means of production, use and governance of a class of pollutants.

Research in Baltimore, Maryland, will examine whether features of urban decay such as population decline, abandoned lots, and unmanaged refuse promote mosquito production and whether this in turn discourages care for and use of the outdoor environment by residents and exacerbates urban decay.  Comprehensive sampling in three focal neighborhoods will quantify the association between the abundances of mosquitoes and the physical and socio-economic status of neighborhoods, and how mosquito exposure influences resident support for and participation in outdoor activities and urban revitalization. Experiments will identify activities that best support and motivate resident-led strategies to control mosquitoes. Specifically, researchers will: 1) assess the quality and quantity of positive and negative social and environmental features in each neighborhood ; 2) quantify mosquito abundance and identify mechanisms that facilitate winter survival; 3) measure resident knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors associated with controlling mosquito breeding habitat and personal exposure; and 4) test the efficacy of education and active citizen-science interventions in changing mosquito control behaviors of residents and their perceptions about neighborhood greening projects. Results will increase understanding of coupled human and pest dynamics in an urban context and provide fundamental information for translating ecological theory in urban ecosystems and developing socio-ecological theory for sustainable advances in urban greening and public health. <br/><br/>Coupled human-mosquito dynamics are an important model for developing new socio-ecological theory on human-pest interactions, improving urban quality of life, and engaging broader community participation in neighborhood revitalization. Despite over a century of organized and often sophisticated efforts to control mosquitoes, nuisance complaints persist and mosquito-borne diseases are a persistent and growing concern in urban communities across the globe. The need for personal responsibility in managing urban pests at the scale of individual parcels is increasingly viewed as the better route to mosquito control in urban and suburban settings. This work investigates this socio-ecological system, integrating expertise and theory from community ecology, geography, education, and environmental justice. The research is designed to include community leaders and residents at all stages of data collection, interpretation, and dissemination, as well as in brainstorming remediation strategies.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students, including members of under-represented groups, use social media to recruit and involve citizen scientists and community members, and partner with city and state agencies and a community-based foundation."

Who bears responsibility for negative downwind impacts of newly constructed wind turbines?  This project will quantify the atmospheric and economic impacts of wind farms to more accurately assess the complex implications of new wind farms on both natural and human systems.   The investigators also will propose nationwide legal frameworks that accurately reflect the physical and economic impacts on wind farms' neighbors.  Appropriate legal guidance can result in greater efficiencies and reduce waste of wind resources.  Because it will couple physical, economic, and legal investigations, the project will help to reduce the frequency of adversarial, litigation-based solutions and maximize public benefit in a fair and predictable manner, thereby providing the policy tools to optimize the development of the nation's sustainable energy resources.

Early research on human well-being and the environment showed that strong, collectively governed institutions help people to manage common lands in ways that enhance ecosystem services and quality of life.  This knowledge has been a key facet of biodiversity conservation and resilience of rural societies worldwide.  Some communities are able to adaptively manage their natural resources much better than others under conditions of rapid change and uncertainty.  What factors enable collectively governed management institutions to effectively respond to potentially catastrophic environmental disturbances?  In rural societies that are urbanizing, activities of daily life increasingly take place outside the family home, in ""non-family organizations"" that expand people's perspectives and choices, such as schools, stores, employers, and health clinics.  These non-family organizations are not collectively governed and have no clear constituents or responsibilities other than to respond to supply and demand for their services, goods, and experiences. In this project, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the responsiveness of resource- management institutions to rapid environmental change is ultimately tied to the distribution and types of market-driven, non-family organizations within communities.  They will conduct their research in the forested buffer zone of the Chitwan National Park, Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot that is home to the endangered Bengal tiger and more than 200,000 Nepali people who live and farm nearby.  One of the world's most invasive plants, Mikania micrantha (""mile-a-minute weed"") recently has spread through community forests and degraded critical ecosystem services that affect wildlife habitat and the livelihoods of residents.  To explore the links among non-family organizations, management institutions, and the spread of Mikania, the researchers will collect social and ecological data in 21 heterogeneous community forests to develop models of social-ecological vulnerability and resilience to environmental change.  They will conduct two experiments to test the relative strength of factors related to Mikania success, including an educational intervention with management institutions, and a common garden experiment that manipulates environmental variables linked to Mikania growth.<br/><br/>This project will test the ability of the ""family modes of organization"" framework, a powerful explanatory tool in demography, to identify factors that cause coupled natural and human systems to be vulnerable or resilient to rapid change.  The project will be an exemplar of ""translational science,"" interdisciplinary research focused on practical solutions to current problems.  The investigators will translate research findings into local action through an intervention aimed to slow the catastrophic spread of invasive, exotic species that threatens biodiversity and human well-being. More broadly, the research will aid sustainable development efforts in other settings in south Asia and the Pacific through partnership with a non-profit organization focused on solving issues in agriculture and the environment.

The critical period of the study, 1000 BC to AD 2000, begins with dispersed settlements accompanied by widespread deforestation and soil erosion.  Population size and density grew rapidly for 800 years, while deforestation and erosion rates declined.  This period was also characterized by striking evidence of political evolution, including the construction of monumental architecture, hieroglyphic carvings detailing wars and alliances, and the construction of a defensive earthwork feature that signaled political territories, and possibly delineated natural resource boundaries.  Population decline and steady reforestation followed until modern migration into the region.

Here, climate change is defined to include gradual changes in the average conditions and evolving patterns of climate variability, such as extreme events, on the interannual to decadal timescale. Climate change may affect hydrology, land quality, crop yields and diversity, as well as altering existing social and economic systems. The project will evaluate all impacts at the level of the agroecosystem.  The agroecosystem is the intersection of a climatic ecological zone with a set of land management and cropping practices that derive from geographic, ecologic, economic, and cultural conditions. Adaptation is a function of internal adaptive capacity, rate of change, potential for informed investment, and socio-cultural and biophysical constraints. In order to address coupled adaptation processes in a comprehensive manner, we will generate probabilistic agroecological scenarios based on patterns of past climate variability and social response (1980-2010), projected future climate impacts and response (2010-2040), household-level analysis of adaptation capacity in BNH communities, and conduct interactive planning sessions in which information on projected risks and uncertainties is used to inform climate adaptation decisions. We will partner with community members participating in a network of Climate Innovation Platforms, allowing us to assess how probabilistic projections of change derived from state of the art climate, crop, and hydrological models can be integrated into adaptation planning. In turn, this allows us to assess how adaptive actions might maximize resilience - the ability to withstand or recover from climate-induced stress - and break the coupled cycle of land degradation and poverty that affects the region today. <br/><br/>This work will examine issues at the core of food security, and water security, and stability in the Nile region.  The Blue Nile Headwaters are a vital water tower of Africa, giving rise to a river that is the lifeblood of downstream populations in Sudan and Egypt. Within the headwaters region itself, however, connected processes of low investment capacity and land degradation drive a cycle of depressed agricultural yields and persistent poverty, making the region especially vulnerable to climate change impacts.  This cycle is reinforced by the dramatic interannual climate variability experienced in the region, and there is reason for concern that conditions will deteriorate in coming decades - both because climate change may bring more frequent drought and more intense rains and because land use pressures are increasing under rapid population growth. These changes have implications for food and water security throughout the region. However, the same coupling of natural and human systems that currently reinforces poverty in this region also offers opportunity. Vulnerability to climate change is determined by the magnitude of that change, the sensitivity of human and natural systems to change, and the capacity of communities to adapt in ways that reduce impacts. The proposed research approach combines best-available scientific tools for monitoring and projecting climate impacts with an unprecedented community-driven evaluation of potential adaptation strategies across a physically and culturally diverse landscape. As such, the study will advance understanding of how vulnerable communities can best make use of uncertain climate projections for future planning. More generally, the development of climate impacts scenarios at the level of the agricultural ecosystems represents a new approach to climate impacts analysis that will be broadly applicable in the U.S. and elsewhere."

However, there are growing concerns about the existing and potential water withdrawal from the FH-HC aquifer due to the large-scale water demand by the oil industry. It is imperative to understand the dynamics of the water depot-based water allocation system and its interactions with the underlying groundwater systems.

The following methods will be employed to achieve this goal. (1) An agent-based model will be developed to study the emergent patterns and dynamics of the water depot-based water allocation system at the Bakken Shale in western North Dakota. (2) The agent-based model will be integrated with the regional groundwater model to simulate the rate of changes in the water levels of the FH-HC aquifer under future socioeconomic and climate scenarios.

The success of the Mongol Empire is a historical enigma.  At its peak in the late 13th century, the empire controlled areas from the Hungarian grasslands to southern Asia and Persia.  Powered by domesticated livestock, the Mongol Empire grew at the expense of farmers in Eastern Europe, Persia, and China.  What environmental factors contributed to the rise of the Mongols?  What factors influenced the disintegration of the empire by 1300?  Energy is considered as critical for human and natural systems to function, yet few studies have examined the role of energy in the success and failure of past societies.  As modern energy sources become increasingly taxed, examples of how past societies adapted to changing energy sources is critical.  In a similar way, as societies become rapidly urbanized, freshwater will be threatened.  Water allows biological systems to capture solar energy and humans to capture, transform, and allocate this energy through their development of social and political systems.  This project will combine archaeological and historical data from the Mongol Empire with tree-ring records of past climate, modeled estimates of grassland productivity and livestock abundance, and lake sediment records of water quality to illuminate the role of energy and water in the history of the Mongol Empire.  The investigators will focus on the Orkhon Valley, the seat of the Mongol Empire, where recent environmental and archeological discoveries allow detailed descriptions of past human and environmental conditions for the first time.  The researchers hypothesize that the arc of the Mongol Empire was influenced by the energy available to nomadic pastoralists for building a mobile military and governmental force sufficient to conquer and govern a significant portion of Asia and Eastern Europe.  They also will investigate whether the contraction of the empire was related to drought, declining grassland productivity, and poor water quality associated with rapid urbanization and climate change.<br/><br/>This project will enhance basic understanding on multiple topics, including the role of water and energy in human and natural systems, the change in climate from the warm Medieval Climate Anomaly to the cold Little Ice Age, the application of lake sediment data for understanding impacts of livestock on water quality, and relationships between climate variation and ecosystem health.  Understanding the role of water and energy in the evolution of a historical society of international renown will help advance consideration of current perspectives on modern systems and their dependence on energy and water sources.  Tree-ring records developed through this project will allow hundreds of wooden artifacts to be dated, thereby providing an annual history of events at Karakorum, the ancient capital of the Mongol Empire.

Areas in Tamil Nadu in which tank irrigation systems have declined over the years will be identified and compared with areas where use of the tanks has persisted. To understand the water-storage dynamics associated with the tanks, the project team will place water level sensors in an identified series of tanks that will provide continuous data regarding water storage throughout the monsoon and dry seasons. It is hypothesized that the ecological and economic benefits provided by these tanks, when adequately maintained and with effective community governance structures, can make these subsistence-level farming communities less vulnerable to variations in the region's yearly monsoons, especially in the face of climate change and rapid groundwater depletion.  <br/><br/>The Madurai region of southern Tamil Nadu, India, faces issues of acute water scarcity, making extensive irrigation systems necessary.  As the areas under cultivation in Tamil Nadu have grown in recent decades, so has the demand for irrigation water.  With this growth, groundwater supplies have become increasingly depleted.  As such, the need for a more sustainable means of providing irrigation water is now being acknowledged.  A promising trend in water management has been to reassess and revive the use of older, local-scale irrigation practices that utilize tank systems.  These tanks, which are, essentially, small reservoirs used for local rainwater harvesting, collect water for both surface water irrigation and groundwater recharge, and have been a source of irrigation and drinking water in India for thousands of years.  The current project will focus on improving our understanding of the dynamics of water storage and groundwater recharge associated with these small irrigation systems, and the importance of the systems to the associated villages. This project will lead to a better understanding of the ways in which traditional rainwater harvesting practices can increase access to both drinking and irrigation water in regions of acute water scarcity. As 800 million people worldwide live in regions where water scarcity issues are an ongoing problem, the greater understanding that is gained in India with regard to rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge will inevitably have cross-cultural value and potential application to a range of regions, from sub-Saharan Africa to the southwestern United States. The research carried out in this project will lay the groundwork for additional explorations of local-level water management systems and institutions in a variety of cultural contexts."

Projected rates of accelerated SLR are expected to cause massive changes that would transform both the ecological and social dynamics of low-lying coastal areas. It is thus essential to improve understanding of the sustainability of coupled coastal human-environment systems in the face of SLR. Salt marshes are intertidal habitats that provide a buffer for coastal communities to SLR and are also valued for many other ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, aesthetics, and tourism. They are highly dynamic systems that have kept pace with changes in sea level over millennia. However, projected rates of SLR and increased human modification of coastal watersheds and shorelines may push marshes past a tipping point beyond which they are lost. Developing realistic scenarios of marsh vulnerability demands an integrated approach to understanding the feedbacks between the biophysical and social factors that influence the persistence of marshes and their supporting functions. This project will examine the comparative vulnerability of salt marshes to SLR in three U.S. Atlantic coastal sites that vary with respect to sediment supply, tidal range and human impacts. The research team will also address how feedbacks from potential adaptations influence marsh vulnerability, associated economic benefits and costs, and practical management decisions. Additional broader impacts include incorporating research results into curriculum used at local schools, an on-line cross-disciplinary graduate course, and on-going teacher-training programs, as well as training one postdoctoral researcher, four graduate students, and eight undergraduate researchers. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.<br/><br/>This project leverages the long-term data, experiments and modeling tools at three Atlantic Coast Long-Term Ecological Research sites (in MA, VA, GA), and addresses the broad interdisciplinary question ""How will feedbacks between marsh response to SLR and human adaptation responses to potential marsh loss affect the overall sustainability of the combined socio-ecological systems?"" The goals of the project are to understand: 1) how marsh vulnerability to current and projected SLR, with and without adaptation actions, compares across biogeographic provinces and a range of biophysical and social drivers; and 2) which marsh protection actions local stakeholder groups favor, and the broader sustainability and economic value implications of feasible adaptation options. The biophysical research uses historical trends, ""point"" and spatial models to determine threshold and long-term responses of marshes to SLR. Social responses to marsh vulnerability are integrated with biophysical models through future scenario planning with stakeholders, economic valuation of marsh adaptation options, and focus groups that place the combined project results within a concrete policy planning context to assess how marshes fit into the larger view of coastal socio-ecological sustainability. This integrated approach at multiple sites along gradients of both environmental and human drivers will allow for general conclusions to be made about human-natural system interactions and sustainability that can be broadly applicable to other coastal systems."

That network confers large economic benefits to the U.S. economy, but can also cause unintentional negative side effects including air pollution, water pollution, and the introduction of harmful invasive species. Thousands of species, some of which become invasive, hitchhike in the ballast water of ships and on the hulls and other exposed surfaces of ships. The risk from invasive species differs among ports based on the number of ships visiting a port and the visiting ships' previous ports of call. This project analyzes the global shipping network to discover where the risk of invasion has been high and to identify where the risk may increase as a result of on-going changes in the shipping network. Predictions about past and future invasions will be tested by sequencing DNA extracted from water samples taken in or near ports to detect the presence of potentially invasive species. Large changes in the shipping network are being driven by creation and expansion of new ports (e.g., liquefied natural gas terminals), the expansion of the Panama Canal, changes in ballast water practices and policies (e.g., new rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard, proposed agreements from the International Maritime Organization), and changes in climate (e.g., opening of Arctic shipping lanes as sea ice declines). Through a formal consultation process with stakeholders, project results about the risk of invasions will inform port managers, ship operators, and policy-makers who can identify opportunities for the most cost effective reductions in risk in order to maximize the benefits of shipping. This project will advance the science of big data networks, improve cutting-edge genetic sequencing methods for environmental samples, and increase the net benefits of shipping via improved information provided to the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and policy-makers.

Given the combination of environmental changes, population growth, and climate impacts, projections suggest that subsistence agriculture and coastal fisheries will fail to support the food needs of many Pacific countries by 2030.  The Solomon Islands in the Western Pacific, with their unique cultural, agricultural, and biological diversity could constitute models for how systems adapt to recurrent change.  Although Solomon Island communities have a long history of effectively addressing major unpredictable environmental and social changes, traditional strategies such as reef closures or fisheries restrictions are now faltering in many areas in response to outside forces such as emerging markets for marine resources that were previously unexploited by local people.  This project will study the relationship among pressures such as climate change and increasing human population size, the health of inter-related human-natural systems, and benefits derived from these systems such as food security, clean water, and biodiversity in order to better inform effective management of people and the land and seascapes that support them.  The project will inform future scenarios and resource management planning across a community-driven conservation network developed over the last decade in partnership with the principle investigators.  This project will also contribute to recommendations for incorporating resilience thinking into policy development for climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and natural resource management in the Pacific and globally.  The researchers will also engage in innovative ways to evaluate and broaden who is participating in the research and management process, in part by exploring technologies that embrace and use local knowledge and cultural identity.  The project will improve the ability of social and biological scientists and of decision makers to manage community landscapes for sustainability at local levels.

Resource use may be shifting due to underlying pressures from demographic, market, and climate changes.  Use of the term biocultural emphasizes that resource management cannot be fully understood from social or biological standpoints alone.  This project will uncover relationships among changing pressures, biocultural states, and socio-ecological benefits.  Researchers will use a pressure-state-benefit-response framework to describe and inform reef-to-ridge management across Solomon Island communities in a multivariate analysis of biocultural state and potential system resilience to ongoing or future shocks.  This project will: 1) evaluate the impact of contemporary landscape mosaic transformation on biocultural state, as defined by indicators of local ecological knowledge, biocultural connectivity, and governance; and 2) assess relationships between the current biocultural state and the state of well-being, both human (as measured by food security and access to sufficient freshwater resources) and ecological (as measured by biodiversity values at the ecosystem scale).  Researchers will analytically relate landscape transformation, biocultural state and well-being benefits to inform future scenario planning.  Researchers will model future shifts with an emphasis on the influence of climate change, market forces, and resource use scenarios to understand how components of a given biocultural state foster resilience potential.  The co-creation of empirical, culturally relevant indicators of biocultural state, combined with participatory scenario planning, will serve as a model for effective integration across western scientific and local knowledge.  This project represents a key advance for the broader scenario planning community by integrating cultural, economic and ecological considerations in a spatially explicit, transparent, and dynamic manner."

The Mara River in East Africa supports the largest remaining overland migration in the world: 1.5 million wildebeest and over 4,000 hippopotami. This project will use small-scale and whole-stream experiments, river sampling and theoretical models to test how nutrient inputs into the Mara River by wildebeest and hippopotami interact with river discharge to influence ecosystem processes such as primary production, nutrient cycling, and whole-ecosystem metabolism. The Mara River is one of the few remaining unregulated rivers heavily influenced by large wildlife populations, and provides a unique opportunity for research. Findings will improve understanding of ecosystems where large wildlife play an important role, and provide a baseline for comparison with systems where wildlife have disappeared or been replaced by humans and domesticated animals.<br/><br/><br/>This research will have relevance to regional concerns relating to both wildlife and water quality. The Mara River is critical to the Serengeti Mara ecosystem and provides water for nearly one million rural poor. Declining water quality has been linked to outbreaks of typhoid and cholera, and eutrophication of Lake Victoria. In addition, wildebeest migration and mass drowning events are of local concern to managers in the Maasai Mara National Park. Research will also address human inputs into the river, which may inform decision makers about how more effective sewage treatment could benefit the region.

Most research has overlooked the important coupling between human responses to climate effects and the cumulative impacts of these responses on ecosystems. Fisheries are a prime example of this feedback:  climate changes cause shifts in species distributions and abundances, and fisheries adapt to these shifts. However, changes in the location and intensity of fishing also have major ecosystem impacts. This project's goal is to understand how climate and fishing interact to affect the long-term sustainability of marine populations and the ecosystem services they support. In addition, the project will explore how to design fisheries management and other institutions that are robust to climate-driven shifts in species distributions. The project focuses on fisheries for summer flounder and hake on the northeast U.S. continental shelf, which target some of the most rapidly shifting species in North America. By focusing on factors affecting the adaptation of fish, fisheries, fishing communities, and management institutions to the impacts of climate change, this project will have direct application to coastal sustainability. The project involves close collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and researchers will conduct regular presentations for and maintain frequent dialogue with the Mid-Atlantic and New England Fisheries Management Councils in charge of the summer flounder and hake fisheries. To enhance undergraduate education, project participants will design a new online laboratory investigation to explore the impacts of climate change on fisheries, complete with visualization tools that allow students to explore inquiry-driven problems and that highlight the benefits of teaching with authentic data. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.<br/><br/>The project will address three questions: 1) How do the interacting impacts of fishing and climate change affect the persistence, abundance, and distribution of marine fishes? 2) How do fishers and fishing communities adapt to species range shifts and related changes in abundance? and 3) Which institutions create incentives that sustain or maximize the value of natural capital and comprehensive social wealth in the face of rapid climate change? An interdisciplinary team of scientists will use dynamic range and statistical models with four decades of geo-referenced data on fisheries catch and fish biogeography to determine how fish populations are affected by the cumulative impacts of fishing, climate, and changing species interactions. The group will then use comprehensive information on changes in fisher behavior to understand how fishers respond to changes in species distribution and abundance. Interviews will explore the social, regulatory, and economic factors that shape these strategies. Finally, a bioeconomic model for summer flounder and hake fisheries will examine how spatial distribution of regulatory authority, social feedbacks within human communities, and uncertainty affect society's ability to maintain natural and social capital."

They function to cleanse polluted water, ameliorate floods, recharge groundwater aquifers, and support diverse flora and fauna.   Regretfully, half of Earth's wetlands have been lost in recent times due to population expansion, pollution, coastal development, and other human activities.  In addition to the ecosystem services mentioned above, wetlands are among the most biogeochemically active habitats on Earth.  They have been identified as key sites for carbon sequestration and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.  These environments are very sensitive to environmental perturbation, and the effects of global climate change - especially sea level rise - are already evident.  Sea level rise can bring saltwater into historically freshwater wetlands, changing the chemical reactions that take place in the sediment and the composition of soil microbial communities.  This research provides a better understanding of freshwater wetland response to saltwater intrusion and specifically focuses on soil microorganisms and their roles in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to its scientific contributions, this project advances both science education and public awareness of the threats facing tidal freshwater wetlands, and includes activities intended to educate the community (grade school children through adults) on basic aspects of environmental science.<br/><br/>Microbial communities have historically been treated as a ""black box"" due to assumptions that there is a high level of functional redundancy and that microbial population dynamics (e.g., in response to global change) are unimportant.  However, numerous recent studies have demonstrated that changes in microbial community composition can directly influence ecosystem process rates, motivating this study of the responses of microbial consortia to disturbance.  The overall goal of this research is to link genomics-based characterization of soil microbial communities with process-level measurements of important ecosystem carbon transformations, and to examine their collective responses to environmental change.  This research project includes both observational and manipulative experiments in the tidal freshwater and oligohaline marshes of the Pamunkey/York River system in Virginia, a major tributary of Chesapeake Bay.  The project combines assessment of wetlands along an existing riverine salinity gradient, as a space-for-time substitution for future saltwater intrusion, with an in situ saltwater addition experiment that characterizes changes in the coupled microbe-plant-soil system.  Molecular genetic analyses (16S sequencing, qPCR, and RT-qPCR) of the soil microbial communities, process rate measurements (iron and sulfate reduction, methanogenesis), and ecosystem carbon dioxide and methane exchanges are being used to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of how compositional changes in microbial communities affect biogeochemical processes. This fundamental knowledge will pave the way for future research that effectively incorporates microbial communities into ecosystem process models."

Many studies have evaluated the impacts of variation in climate on forests within a single season, but few have examined the impacts across seasons and how these impacts may interact. Seasonal impacts may differ, and they may interact in ways that are either antagonistic or synergistic. For example, soil warming in summer may increase root growth, but warming in winter may increase the frequency of freeze/thaw cycles and damage plant root systems. The goal of this project is to determine the interactive effects of winter and growing season climate change on nutrient and carbon uptake in northern hardwood forests. This will be accomplished by establishing an ecosystem warming experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, and a greenhouse experiment at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, MA. Data generated from these experiments will be used to modify an existing ecosystem-scale model (PnET-BGC) to improve its ability to predict ecosystem nutrient retention and carbon storage. This combination of experimentation and modeling will improve our understanding of the interactive effects of increased soil temperatures in the growing season and more frequent freeze/thaw cycles in winter, and may transform our thinking of how climate change will affect northeastern forests and other temperate ecosystems.<br/>This CAREER project will integrate research, teaching, and outreach. In particular, twenty-five high school teachers will be trained in forest ecology through formal lectures and field exercises. Ten high school students, ten undergraduates, and two graduate students will perform the hands-on laboratory and field experiments. Up to 240 undergraduate students at Boston University will participate in weekend field trips to learn about forest ecology and gain field research experience. Together, these activities will enhance scientific literacy and foster an understanding of the relationship between variation in climate and ecological processes for both students and high school teachers.

This research project investigates long term perspectives on water security, food security, habitat loss, cultural change, and land management among pastoralists experiencing change in a rangeland ecosystem. Using archaeological, historical aerial imagery, remote sensing techniques, ethnography, and generative modeling, this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of complex interactions within pastoralist/grazing socio-environmental systems in semi-arid lands globally. It will test the hypothesis that the current intersection of development, land management, and changing environmental circumstances represents a recent phenomenon that deviates from long-term trends and if left unchecked will ultimately lead to environmental degradation. Project results will be widely disseminated to increase access to clean water and healthcare among the focal pastoralist community. The project will also produce data that is useful for understanding the resiliency of grazing practices relevant to cattle-ranchers in the United States and globally, and teaching materials (e.g. computer simulations, a roleplaying boardgame) to educate US students about systems thinking, resiliency, and conservation.

This research addresses three linked questions about the coupled dynamics of deer populations, landscape characteristics, and deer management strategies: 1) How do changes in deer management institutions, hunter behaviors, and landscape characteristics shape deer populations? 2) How and why do particular social and environmental processes trigger changes in deer management strategies in some circumstances but not others? 3) How does collaboration (or a lack of collaboration) among land and wildlife managers at multiple scales influence the human and environmental outcomes of deer management programs? The investigators will undertake an integrated mixed methods analysis combining aerial surveys of deer populations, vegetation sampling, community surveys, in-depth interviews of key actors, and agent-based models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such gradual and extreme changes have typically been studied independently, however they are most likely to occur simultaneously, raising important questions about how they may interact. For example, will the nature of ecosystem responses to drought be affected by a gradual increase in temperature? This project will address this question by building on a long-term climate change study in a Kansas grassland, the Rainfall Manipulation Plots (RaMPs) experiment. The RaMPs experiment has imposed 15 years of altered rainfall patterns, larger rainfall events and longer periods between events, and 10 years of continuous (1-2 degree C) warming. Those treatments have resulted in consistently dry soils, increased plant water stress, reduced plant growth, genetic changes in populations of the most abundant grass species, and changes in soil carbon dioxide emissions, nutrients, and microbes. These varied responses are predicted to increase the ecosystem's resistance to extreme drought and its ability to recover after drought. To test those predictions, two years of extreme drought (similar to the 1930's dust bowl) followed by a year of normal rainfall will be imposed on experimental plots and multiple ecosystem responses will be measured.<br/><br/>A field-based course for undergraduates entitled 'Climate Change and Grasslands' will be offered. This course will enhance students' basic understanding of the scientific process and introduce them to the complexities of climate-ecosystem interactions through lectures, class projects and field trips that showcase results from climate change experiments in Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico."
