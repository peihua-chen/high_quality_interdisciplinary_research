Yet local institutions often enable effective stewardship of these resources, and build social and ecological resilience to environmental change. The objective of this project is to explore the interplay between key ecological, economic, and institutional processes related to small-scale fisheries in Mexico's Gulf of California, and how interactions among these processes influence both ecological and economic outcomes. Previous scholarship focused on the gulf and other areas with low governance, enforcement, and monitoring capacity has often emphasized either ecological or institutional dynamics, but rarely integrates ecological, economic, and institutional analyses as proposed here. Through a combination of conceptual and quantitative modeling and field research, we are developing an innovative interdisciplinary approach for analyzing coupled natural and human coastal marine systems. Through these activities and associated interactions with other scientists and practitioners in the region, we are collecting substantial primary social, economic and ecological data to inform the development of quantitative models of human-environment linkages in the gulf, and contributing to the training of the next generation of sustainability science scholars. <br/><br/>Well-functioning coastal and marine ecosystems provide a wide array of societal benefits, including food production, protection from coastal storms, and opportunities for recreation and tourism. Stewardship to ensure continued provision of these benefits requires understanding the connections between ecosystems and the people who live with them. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these interactions is vital for mitigation and adaptation to our changing world, particularly in the face of climate change. In this project, we focus on small-scale, or artisanal, fisheries in the Gulf of California, Mexico. To sustain fisheries in the gulf, a variety of management tools are under consideration, including marine reserves and other marine protected areas, catch shares, and territorial use rights. Moreover, the expected decentralization of fisheries management due to the recently amended Fisheries Law is anticipated to alter both ecological and socioeconomic dynamics within the region. Through the development of an interdisciplinary framework for understanding coastal marine environment-society connections, along with gulf-specific analyses, we will help inform development of innovative marine management strategies in this region and other coastal and marine areas worldwide."

These fires are newsworthy because they affect the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people and because the types of fire are so different than in the recent history of these places.  Certain types of fire are necessary to sustain key structures and functions of many environments around the world.  Both people and climate can alter the types of fire that these environments experience through their effects on fire ignitions and on vegetation (fuels).  In various circumstances these alterations may either increase or decrease the risk for types of fires that will not sustain those environments or the human societies dependent upon them.  Although the physical and ecological responses of fire and vegetation to weather/climate are relatively well known, the interplay between human activities and fire are poorly understood, especially over time scales of centuries.  Improved understanding of these interactions is needed for managing these forests today, and for anticipating future social and environmental vulnerabilities where high-density human settlements have developed -- also known as the Wildland-Urban Interface.  <br/><br/>In the past half-century many thousands of homes have been built within North American forests dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees.  These forests and communities are now extremely vulnerable to large, severe fires during droughts as a consequence of fire exclusion and other land use practices.  Through a historical case study, this project tests alternative hypotheses of how human activities at the Wildland- Urban Interface affect the response of fire-adapted pine forests to climate change and conversely, how humans respond to these changes over multiple centuries.  The study area is an ancient Wildland Urban Interface in northern New Mexico where large communities of Native American farmers lived within ponderosa pine forests through varying climate episodes over the last 1,000 years.  Archaeology and paleoecology will be combined to build multi-century fire and forest histories across gradients of human population sizes, ranging from large towns to relatively unoccupied areas.  Dynamic computer models will be developed, and using paleoclimatic data as input they will simulate fire and forest histories across the landscape and through time.  Tested against the local fire histories, these simulations will be varied in the magnitude and location of human impacts to identify tipping points in the sustainability of these forests and human communities.  <br/><br/>The understanding of long-term, landscape-scale dynamics of human societies, forests, and climate generated by this project will be necessary for sustainable management of similar forests at the Wildland Urban Interface across the American West and elsewhere.  Information from the project will be provided directly to manager-partners who are engaged in landscape-scale fire and forest management initiatives on federal and tribal lands.  Participatory research with American Indian tribes whose ancestors lived in these ponderosa pine forests will contextualize the fire and forest histories and human responses to environmental changes. Participation in both research and education will strengthen the relationships between scientists, managers, and community members, facilitating the use of scientific information in management decisions aimed at establishing resilient, sustainable forests.  An educational program will establish a legacy of learning by developing and implementing K-12 lesson plans that integrate fire-society issues in science and history classrooms in the region.  The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, participation of American Indian research partners and underrepresented K-12 students, and the linkages to contemporary managers provide a broad capacity to disseminate project results in meaningful, applicable, and lasting ways."

The combination of climate change, human withdrawals of water, and land use decisions threaten stream flow and shallow groundwater that is crucial to the maintenance of riparian corridors.  Linked biophysical and societal stresses can push riparian systems across critical thresholds, tipping points beyond which restoration to earlier conditions is unlikely.  This can cause loss of broader social-ecological resilience; that is, the capacity of systems to retain essential functions, including provision of water and other ecosystem services.  This project will improve understanding of how changes in social and natural processes affect the resilience of riparian systems and, by extension, the ecosystem services these systems provide.  Research will focus on two adjacent river systems: the Upper San Pedro River, flowing northward from Sonora, Mexico into Arizona in the United States, and the Upper Sonora River, flowing south within Sonora.  An agent-based model will be created to translate interactions among environmental conditions, societal rules, and human practices into likely changes to the riparian corridors under study.  This project will answer critical questions about coupled human and ecological processes in riparian systems; responses of riparian systems to stresses; and how crossing thresholds can be assessed.  <br/><br/>This research will develop new techniques for modeling social-ecological interactions in riparian corridors that will have direct application in the management of stream ecosystems.  The project will provide opportunities for stakeholders at all levels, from officials managing natural resources, to individuals visiting riparian corridors, to use science-based tools for informed decision-making.  This work engages stakeholders across national boundaries in participatory science and management of ecosystem services.  This project will also contribute to education at K-12 grade levels and provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students."

Alternatively they may be considered as complex systems -- collections of agents engaged in rule-governed behavior. In either case, robustness refers to the stability and resistance to perturbation of such dynamical or complex systems as they evolve in state space.  A dynamical system is said to be structurally stable if reasonably small perturbations to the system result in a new dynamical system with the same qualitative dynamics.  The concept of robustness raises questions that lie outside the purview of stability theory, such as the interplay of system organization and system dynamics.  Processes like adaptation and positive feedback can increase the robustness of living systems and coupled natural and human systems, but the linkage between efficiency and robustness may be an inverse one in which optimal efficiency is at the expense of robustness in the face of changing environmental conditions.  In some cases, robustness may be an emergent property of evolved systems, or it may be possible to engineer systems to enhance their robustness.  To address these issues, this award will sponsor a conference to be held at the Santa Fe Institute in the Spring of 2003.  The conference will bring together scientists from a range of disciplines, including physics, mathematics, computer science, earth and climate science, ecology, anthropology and archaeology, to discuss theoretical research and case studies, with emphasis being placed on comparative discussion of the case studies.  Papers will be circulated in advance and presented in a single forum attended by all conference participants.  Results of the conference are expected to be published<br/><br/>The robustness of coupled natural and human systems has become a matter of increasing concern as the modern industrial system's impact on the natural systems of the planet becomes more and more apparent and issues of sustainability become paramount.  This conference will contribute to explorations of robustness in coupled natural and human systems at scales ranging from planetary (climate) and macroscales through the mesoscale of sociocultural systems to the microscopic scale of disease microevolution.  Participants will explore the association of different spatial scale with varying temporal scales, and they will help answer a number of critical questions, including whether robustness is best assessed by analysis of existing data or through simulation modeling, how engineered systems compare to complex adaptive systems in terms of robustness and/or a calculus of costs and benefits, and under what circumstances robust systems are most likely to develop.  Through this conference, participants and other scholars will develop new insights into and new approaches for investigating robustness in coupled natural and human systems.  Broader impacts of this project include the expansion of an interdisciplinary network of scientists to explore this important topic in a collaborative framework.  The results of their discussions and subsequent collaborative activities could ultimately yield many practical benefits for land and resource managers as well as others who have responsibilities associated with maintaining environmental quality.

How well these communities can adapt is both constrained and facilitated by engagement in local and global social, political, and economic networks.  Understanding the complexity of these interactions is critical to the effective management of human response to change in the subarctic and elsewhere.  This research project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of American, Japanese, and Russian scholars and students to examine the 5,000-year history of human-environmental interactions along the Kuril Island chain in the northwest Pacific.  Evidence of human colonization, persistence and abandonment at various times in the past five millennia and under different social, economic, and technological regimes will be used to study human vulnerability and resilience to both catastrophic and gradual environmental changes, including human-induced changes.  The project's primary objectives include (1) understanding feedbacks among climate, sea ice, marine and terrestrial ecology, and human activity; (2) estimating the degree of human vulnerability to catastrophic events and their ecological consequences at different spatial and temporal scales; and (3) assessing the role of cultural variables both in influencing community survival and affecting environmental changes.  These objectives will be tackled through an ecologically integrated study of archaeological and historic records of human settlement and abandonment; geologic evidence of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis; paleoecologic and oceanographic evidence of past vegetation and marine conditions; and climatological evidence of past temperature, sea ice, and storminess.  Evidence collected in the field over three summers will be used to test and calibrate agent-based computer models and simulations.  Numerical models will be run to detect the most critical social, ecological, and physical variables affecting human resilience and vulnerability.  The project will include education and outreach partnerships with indigenous Ainu communities in Hokkaido, Japan; the development of secondary school education kits and interactive computer simulations through the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the University of Washington; and the participation of undergraduate and graduate students throughout the project.<br/><br/>This study will make significant contributions to understanding the complexity of coupled human and natural systems.

It will provide models that can be adapted to other contexts and modern conditions where coastal communities appear particularly vulnerable to environmental and social factors beyond their control.  More generally, this research will provide tools in the form of model prototypes that can be adapted to many different regions where human-environmental dynamics are complex.

The ancient Maya reached a high population density, deforested much of their environment, and caused significant soil erosion in southern Mexico and northern Central America by about 800 AD. In the next century their civilization declined over large areas, with populations reduced by 90% in some regions. Our goals are to: 1) understand the interactions between the ancient Maya and their environment that contributed to the collapse of their civilization in northwest Belize, Central America, and 2) to assess the impact of ancient Maya land use, ending 1200 years ago, on the present environment. To do this we will study archaeology, geology, and ecology at the same research sites and overlay the results to reveal connections among ancient land use, ancient impacts on soil and topography, and the present soil characteristics and tree species composition of a tropical forest. We will work in an area where there was a variety of intensive ancient Maya land uses, but where there has been little disturbance since the collapse of the Maya and the re-growth of the forest beginning c. 1200 years ago, which means that the footprint of the ancient Maya in our study area should be more evident than in other places.  The study will be carried out in the 250,000-acre Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, administered by the Programme for Belize (PfB), a Belizean conservation organization, and be conducted under the auspices of the PfB Archaeology Project, operated by the University of Texas at Austin.<br/> <br/>Humans increasingly affect the planet, for example, by deforesting the landscape and accelerating soil erosion.  These changes could lead to """"tipping points"""", when ecosystems suddenly change radically and no longer support agriculture, provide adequate water, or otherwise supply human needs. Scientists need to study these impacts and suggest how to mitigate the present changes and prevent future tipping points. But we can also learn by studying tipping points reached in the past, such as the collapse of the ancient Maya described above. To understand that collapse we are combining social science (archaeology), geo-science, and ecological science to study past events at sites of ancient Maya civilization in present-day Belize. Archaeologists in our team will study past land use. Geo-archaeologists will study past topography and soils. Ecologists will study past and present forest environments. Our work is guided by a model connecting ancient land use, deforestation and soil erosion, consequences for the environment, and responses by the ancient Maya to these landscape changes. In addition to understanding past events we are interested in the long-term consequences of ancient deforestation for the present-day forests. The similarities and differences between ancient deforestation (after which the modern, fairly diverse forest re-grew in Belize) and modern deforestation could provide clues to the consequences of modern land use and provide recommendations for improved use. Another goal for us is to create a model collaboration between social, geological, and biological scientists for the study of the ancient Maya and the modern forest, and that can be a general model for studying and managing environmental problems."

Rates of sea-level rise already exceed those experienced over the last several thousand years and are predicted to be substantially greater by the end of the century, offering the potential that barriers could drown. Natural barriers respond to sea-level rise through a process of landward migration - during storms, overwash and breaching transfer sediment to the back of a barrier. Human activities intended to preserve coastal infrastructure, such as building seawalls, constructing groynes, nourishing beaches, stabilizing inlets, or armoring updrift headlands, have accumulated to the point where a new landform, unprecedented in earth?s history, has emerged: the """"developed barrier"""". Typically, engineering activities on developed barriers prevent or counteract overwash. Two key questions guide this research: 1) Are there threshold rates of sea-level rise beyond which coastal barriers will drown completely? and 2) Will human responses to sea-level rise mitigate or exacerbate the potential for losses of developed barriers across entire systems? A multidisciplinary team of geologists, numerical modelers, and economists will engage in an integrated field and modeling study to examine the behavior and predict the fate of barrier systems. Focused geologic investigations will investigate how barriers responded to higher rates of sea-level rise in the past (rates that match those predicted for later this century). Numerical models will study the evolution of developed barrier systems at decadal to centennial time scales by coupling natural sediment transport processes and human alterations of the coast. Different human protection strategies will be explored, comparing coordinated versus uncoordinated responses and considering whether well-informed versus poorly informed responses result in different barrier futures. The most important question will be whether human activities intended to preserve infrastructure and beach recreation may make wholesale collapse, or """"drowning"""" of barrier systems more likely.<br/><br/>The drowning of barrier beaches due to sea-level rise is an issue of global importance. The same wave processes that created these barriers will cause them to change dramatically as sea levels rise. Barriers will do more than flood passively (like a bath tub); storms, waves, and tides can reshape entire coastlines. Barriers contain a beach, a resource that is particularly valued, and house significant amounts of infrastructure, including homes, resort complexes, hotels, and roadways. Accordingly, humans respond to coastal changes by bulldozing beaches, pumping sand, and armoring the coast. What are the long-term effects of these activities on the naturally occurring processes on the coast? This research aims to provide guidelines on how the global system of barriers will respond to changes in sea level and to changes in mitigation strategies, with a goal of identifying optimal societal responses to reduce the resulting potential economic losses. This research will involve communication with stakeholders and coastal managers to obtain their inputs to help formulate and assess decision-making strategies for model simulations and to disseminate the study findings. This program will also provide interdisciplinary training for students, who are the next generation of coastal researchers, on the diverse aspects of coastal processes."

Chicago Wilderness is a consortium of over 240 organizations that has as its primary goal the conservation, restoration and management of biodiversity on 360,000 acres of protected open space in the greater Chicago area.

Several related research approaches will be utilized, including development of models to explore how interactions among different constituencies may lead to different restoration and management practices, and in turn, how these practices affect biodiversity outcomes.  Documenting the range of biodiversity outcomes in woodland and savanna restoration sites across the Chicago region will permit a test of hypotheses about the relationship between distinct models of the restoration planning process (traditional, co-management, grassroots) and biodiversity.

This project will also advance several long-term goals for urban land cover modeling. Most significantly will be an opportunity to develop the links between urbanization and hydrologic systems in a spatially explicit context. The importance of water resource management to serve the public interest is a topic of growing importance globally because of stresses induced by patterns of growth, but the tools and data currently available to support decision-making are inadequate. This research will help to close that gap. This effort is also of interest to the Chesapeake Bay program, in its work to address questions about critical thresholds and sustainability.Interaction with state and local agency personnel will be carried out in order to incorporate their questions and policy concerns into modeling scenarios and to discuss the implications of the findings from this project."

This project seeks to strengthen an international, interdisciplinary research network whose goal is to advance understandings of the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems by characterizing the sources of vulnerability of mountain systems to the combined effects of global warming and global economic restructuring.  The strategy underlying the project is to develop research ties among scientists from multiple disciplines studying two mountain regions where the individual impacts of climate change and globalization are already strongly manifest and well documented.  These regions are: the Greater Yellowstone Region in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho in the United States and the Mount Kilimanjaro Region  in Kenya and Tanzania.  U.S. and African scientists from the natural and social sciences will meet at workshops held in Montana and Kenya to address a range of emerging questions, such as how biophysical heterogeneity and diversity of institutional arrangements and economic strategies in mountain systems may enhance, reduce, or change in kind and scale the vulnerability of these regions to climate change.  Participants from mountain regions in Asia, Europe, and South America also will be invited to participate in these workshops as a first step in expanding the research network globally.<br/><br/>This project will lay the groundwork to develop a global research strategy to address the vulnerability of mountain systems to the interacting influences of global change and globalization.  Scientifically, mountain regions provide an ideal setting to develop comparative case studies of differential impacts of global change and globalization given that mountain regions are distributed all over the globe, from the Equator almost to the poles and from oceanic to highly continental climates and are experiencing globalization at widely varying rates.  Mountain regions also are critically important in assessing the impacts of global change given that they occupy about one-fifth of the Earth's surface and provide goods and services to about half of humanity.

Adaptive capacity refers to a system's ability to change in basic structure or function when it is perturbed beyond its capacity for resilience.  The concepts of sustainability, resilience, and adaptability are clearly related but few studies have systematically analyzed how interactions among them affect system-level dynamics, fragility, uncertainty, or risk.  This interdisciplinary research project will investigate how regional coupled natural and human systems respond to changes in climate, economic, and policy conditions that operate over larger geographic and temporal scales.  The investigators will explore these concepts in an agriculturally based Midwestern watershed (the Iowa/Cedar River Watershed in Iowa) within the context of sustainability, resilience, and adaptability.  They will define sustainability using Elkington's Triple Bottom Line concept (people, planet, profit) in which social and environmental values are added to the traditional economic measures of success.  In the context this particular study, they will consider surface and groundwater resources that will not be polluted or withdrawn so that intended agricultural uses can no longer be supported and agriculture practices that do not deplete the soil or groundwater, and, at a minimum, supports  existing levels of economic activity. The investigators will evaluate the multidimensional tradeoffs that exist among traditional measures of optimality, such as maximization of environmental quality and economic return, and measures of resilience, adaptability, and sustainability. To conduct this analysis, they will develop models that simulate how landscapes change in response to changes in natural and socioeconomic factors.  Land-use decision making will be modeled to simulate how humans respond to changing conditions, and these models will be linked to models of surface and ground water quality to quantify environmental impact.  Evolutionary computation techniques will be developed to produce production possibility frontiers that quantify tradeoffs among competing objectives.  Stakeholder preferences for various objectives will be solicited through focus groups, and surveys and cyberinfrastructure will be developed to support the significant computational needs of this study.<br/><br/>While landscapes are in a continual state of change, the national and global-scale factors that currently affect landscapes in the Midwest are without precedent.  The generation of precise predictions regarding future conditions is an unrealistic goal under such conditions.  This project therefore will evaluate a suite of plausible scenarios to identify those strategies that are most likely to result in sustainable agricultural landscapes.  The investigators hypothesize that sustainable outcomes are produced by systems that have an ability to adapt to changing and uncertain conditions and that possess the resiliency needed to respond to unexpected and significant perturbations.  Natural (e.g., climate) and human (e.g., policy and economic) processes can constrain or enhance the ability of systems to adapt and respond to change and uncertainty.  It is important to promote processes that enhance sustainability, and avoid those that produce constraints. This project will advance the theory and practice of sustainability science by constructing models that link adaptability, resilience, and sustainability to more traditional measures of economic and environmental optimality.  From a more practical perspective, the project will have an impact on policy and land management in the Midwest by providing better data and analytical tools to decision makers as they address complex problems and refine policy.  The project also will provide information and examples that help the general public understand the imperative of sustainability in the context of changing climatic and economic conditions.  Because of the uncertainty associated with the magnitude and spatiotemporal pattern of regional, national, and international changes, research designed to bound uncertainty, to document plausible natural and socioeconomic outcomes, and to analyze the impact of alternative adaptation strategies can be especially timely and important.

Along the U.S. West Coast, nearly all waters deeper than 20 fathoms (~36 m) are closed to all bottom fishing to protect several species of rockfish from local extinction.  No-take marine reserves have been created around the northern Channel Islands as a means of protecting biodiversity and fish abundances.  The well-documented decline of fisheries and ecological diversity of nearshore waters has engendered a """"crisis-mode"""" philosophy for the management of nearshore fish resources.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine the complexity of nearshore communities and the fisheries that depend upon them.  Nearshore fisheries couple natural (ecological) and human (fishery management) processes in an emergent dynamic system that is rich in complexity.  The project's goal is to develop a process-level description of nearshore fisheries and their management patterned after California coastal environments.  The investigators will examine the emergent complexity that arises due to interactions among chaotic coastal circulations, fished organism life cycles, the productivity and suitability of nearshore habitats, the intensity and nature of fish harvesting, the economics governing fisheries, fishers and fishery regulations, and the bureaucratic system that implements regulations.  The aim of these analyses is to assess the balance points among costs, profits, uncertainties, stock viability, and ecological values of nearshore fished environments.  Central to developing a predictive understanding of the interactions between flow, fish and fishing is the notion of temporal and spatial scales.  The physics, biology, and socioeconomic processes governing this coupled natural-human system operate on inherently different spatial and temporal scales.  Without considering the mismatch in scales explicitly, mismanagement of fisheries is likely to continue unabated.  Recent advances in modeling coastal ocean circulations, marine life cycle dynamics, the values of information to fishery management, and the consequences of management choices in the face of uncertainty have independently created the pieces necessary to assemble a synthetic approach to nearshore fisheries management.  Moreover, large-scale programs monitoring the dynamics of coastal ecosystems are providing the empirical data necessary to parameterize and test these models.  The investigators will link these components into new computational and conceptual models that examine optimal management choices in the face of unavoidable physical and biological uncertainty.<br/><br/>The issues addressed and conceptual frameworks that will be studied will have broad, global impacts.  Declines in fish stocks and yields are not restricted to any nation or geographical region.  Indeed, the core problems from mismatches in spatial and temporal scales are characteristic of nearly all marine fisheries.  In addition, although fisheries management commonly stops at political borders, ocean flows and fish do not.  The ecological scales of coastal ecosystems are inherently international in scope.  The international partnerships between this proposed effort and ongoing ecological programs in Mexico, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia will expand the regional focus of this effort to global dimensions.  This project also will provide educational opportunities across a range of ages.  This program will integrate opportunities for interdisciplinary education at elementary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels as well as through adult programs.

Hunting practices in particular among many indigenous groups are probably strongly regulated by internal controls, based on a combination of spiritual beliefs (cosmology), social rituals, and natural history knowledge.  Despite the evidence for the key role of cosmology in regulating resource use, most work on game overexploitation and the abandonment of traditional hunting practices by indigenous peoples, particularly in the Neotropics of Central America and northern South America, has focused on the effects of market integration and ignored spiritual and other cultural practices.  This research project will test the fundamental hypothesis that retention of traditional practices and cosmology by indigenous societies buffers them against the process of integration into the national society, thereby preventing biodiversity and ecosystem degradation by the indigenous societies themselves.  This hypothesis will be evaluated by quantifying resource-use practices and biodiversity status among communities of one ethnic group that differ in their degree of retention of traditional cosmology and practices.  The project will be based in the 1.7 million-hectare Raposa Indigenous Area in the northern Brazilian Amazon.  The dynamics of hunting by the Macuxi people of this region offer an excellent system for bridging theory and practice in the study of complexity.  Hunting practices and degree of integration to Brazilian society vary among 206 villages distributed across the heterogeneous landscape in Raposa.  A mechanistic model of animal population dynamics and human hunting practices will be developed and tested using quantitative and qualitative approaches.  Socioeconomic data, wildlife data, and remotely sensed data will be collected, integrated, and analyzed within a geographic information system.  In addition to a better understanding of human-biodiversity linkages in indigenous areas, outcomes of this project will include (1) educational materials for the Macuxi and the institutions that work with them, (2) a distance-linked graduate seminar in which students collaborate across departments, campuses and disciplines, (3) broadening of the participation of women and minority students in science, and (4) enhancement of the infrastructure for science by linking institutions with different areas of specialty into a teaching and research network that will benefit students who would normally have access only to their own institution.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of effective development policies and biodiversity conservation and will help provide theoretical background for coupled human-natural systems in the subsistence or semi-subsistence societies that characterize much of tropics.  Research results will be relevant to discussions on the role of overkill by low technology hunters in Pleistocene extinctions and the synergistic effects of environmental conditions and forms of social organization and decision making on the intensity of natural resource depletion.  The results will be particularly germane for the ongoing debate on the role of """"people in parks"""" and on the contribution that indigenous peoples will make to biodiversity conservation worldwide.  The geographical location of this study is significant unto itself.  Roraima covers a large portion of the unstudied and largely unmanaged high diversity Guiana Shield forest-savanna transition.  The area, which grades from dry savannas through mesic and wet forests to montane cloud forest and tepui habitats, represents one of the last wilderness areas on Earth.  For this key ecological area, the future of biodiversity lies in the hands of indigenous peoples.  This study will provide key insights regarding how the internal cultural dynamics of indigenous societies influence and are influenced by biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, with implications for human-environment interactions in Raposa and elsewhere where indigenous peoples retain an important presence.

Scientific Merit: The ability to design and construct nanoscale computing and memory elements is one of the most interesting challenges for bio-mimetic device engineering today. Additional challenges include the use of proteins as efficient bio-molecular machines in information processing applications, the systematic study of protein structure-function relationships, the ability to change, retain and probe states of bio-molecular machines, and the development and dissemination of simulation tools to assist such experimental efforts. This Emerging Models and Technologies for Computation (EMT) team eagerly accepts these challenges and proposes to investigate the use of transmembrane proteins (ion-motive ATP-ases) as bio-molecular statemachines, critically examining their structure, function and performance with a view to building computational state machines capable of logic operations and storage. Building on the existing tools and experience, and motivated by the potential of transmembrane proteins as tested blueprints for biomimetic molecular machines,<br/>the team will investigate the electrophysiological response, atomic structure and  thermodynamic efficiency of the Na+/K+ ATPase from both fundamental and applied engineering points of view, at each stage asking and addressing key questions regarding their use as active nanostructures for computation.<br/><br/>The proposal team includes a synergistic group of researchers from Ohio University who bring together the skills and background crucial for the study of ion motive transmembrane proteins. First, we will perform steady-state and transient measurements on the Na/K pump and investigate the structure and function by electrical and optical means of pumps altered by site-directed mutagenesis. This will allow us to identify, isolate and study specific pump conformations corresponding to a given logic state of the protein. Second, we will utilize a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to obtain high-resolution images of mutated pump<br/>proteins (which has never been attempted before). This will lead to better structural understanding of the mechanism of ion transport needed by both this study and the bio-engineering community as a whole. Third, we will support the experimental studies with modeling and simulation efforts. Specific issues we will address will include: 1) which states of the pump cycle are the most accessible and useful for computing tasks? 2) How<br/>do we 'read out' and 'write in' such logic states either electrically, optically (using fluorescence) or by means of STM-protein interactions? 3) What are the thermodynamic limits and efficiency for transport protein based computing? 4) How can STM atomic imaging and manipulation techniques aid in the understanding of structure-function questions of transport proteins in general and the Na/K pump in particular? and 5) How can we disseminate existing numerical tools such as molecular dynamics simulators and develop new compact simulators to guide protein based bio-molecular machine design? These questions are a small sample of issues addressable through the unique combination of powerful experimental techniques and simulation expertise found in our team.<br/><br/>II. Broader Impacts: The scientific work will involve both graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows from three distinct academic fields, surface physics, biological sciences and engineering for a common interdisciplinary application. These collaborations will result in broad dissemination of the research outcomes via publications, public and professional presentations. Locally, to counter the sub-standard coalstricken<br/>economical/educational climate of Southeastern Ohio and to promote diversity and gender/racial equity, we propose outreach and educational activities that will involve the direct participation of the PIs in bringing nano-bio science education to rural and inner-city schools through broadly accessible presentations and science fair projects in which developments in nano-bio science and engineering are highlighted. To provide an impact<br/>for the broader public, including Appalachian communities of southeastern Ohio, northern Kentucky and western West Virginia, we will regularly contribute to science programs on OhioU's public radio/TV station WOUB and provide financial support and internship opportunities for their student writers. All students to be supported with this proposal will participate in NSF-funded Summer School-programs and will become users of NanoHub partnership in computational nanotechnology, and the academic personnel will disseminate<br/>findings on transport protein devices, ensuring that results obtained from this collaboration produces maximum benefits for NSF/NIH-supported biomimetic science initiatives, especially through external collaborators at Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. <br/>"

The bay suffers from declines in dissolved oxygen, submersed aquatic vegetation, and finfish and shellfish fisheries.  Nitrogen loading from adjacent lands is a key cause of this impairment.  State and federal agencies have agreed to reduce nitrogen loading into the Bay by 40 percent before 2011.  Much progress has been made in mitigating nitrogen loading from point sources, particularly agriculture and sewage treatment plants, and attention is now turning to non-point sources of nitrogen in the bay's watershed.  On an area basis, urban and suburban lands contribute the most nutrients to the bay.  The amount of nitrogen released to the bay is a product of interactions between hydrology, biology, chemistry, and social factors and therefore is an excellent integrator for understanding complexity in coupled natural-human ecosystems.  The goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to investigate the links among landscape structure, nitrogen flux from urban watersheds, and the social and physical capacity to alter the landscape through vegetation management.  A feedback loop linking these factors will be investigated.  Urban designs that satisfy community preferences but also are aimed at reducing nitrogen loading will be investigated as a tool to close the feedback loop.  The investigators will model how new architectural and landscape architectural designs alter landscape structure and therefore influence nitrogen export from urban and suburbanizing watersheds.  They will work with managers to identify vegetation management options thought to minimize nitrogen loss from the land, and they will incorporate those options into new urban designs.  The physical and social constraints on the ability of contrasting neighborhoods to adopt the prospective designs will be evaluated.  The designs that prove to be adoptable by real communities will be included in models of altered metropolitan landscapes to predict the capacity of future landscape structure and associated management to prevent nitrogen flow to the bay.<br/><br/>This project will have important implications.  First, it will employ and test a new integrated land-cover classification appropriate to complex, urban regions.

In addition, communities, primary and secondary schools, college students, graduate students, and post-docs will benefit from the project through employment, summer student internships and teacher fellowships, teacher workshops, after-school and summer programs, and development of curricular materials.  These activities will link the research with under-represented populations and will promote a """"career ladder"""" to expose members of these groups to environmental science professions.  Outreach to federal, state, and local government managers, non-profit organizations, and community groups will focus on vegetation management and design options.

Suburbanization can also produce substantial social disruptions, as established populations (and their contributions to society and the economy) are replaced by new populations and their land uses.  This process of transforming land cover to support suburban land uses is so multi-dimensional that few research projects have analyzed and modeled the process in a holistic manner.  One complicating factor is the conflicting character of human-environment interactions, as environmental processes unfold alongside the promotion of single-family, low-density development, the expansion of affordable housing, and the preservation of a sense of place.  Another complicating factor is that a single type of land-cover transformation can be associated with various land uses.  For example, because two low-density residential areas may exhibit a high proportion of lawn cover but with different water and fertilizer application rates; the two neighborhoods will exhibit different environmental outcomes.  There are few empirically based explanations for linking specific suburban land covers with specific land uses and for predicting the associated social and environmental outcomes.  This research project will examine how suburbanization affects the environment within a tightly coupled analytical framework, examining questions fundamental to social, natural, and geographic information sciences.  Northeastern Massachusetts is a compelling natural laboratory for examining these dynamics, because metropolitan Boston is sprawling into this coastal area.  Data gathered through fieldwork and statistical and process-based modeling will be used to characterize, explain, and model these dynamics in a suburbanizing coupled human-watershed-estuary system in a 26-town Massachusetts study area.  The investigators will employ a suite of methods, such as conducting interviews, evaluating primary and secondary statistical data, taking in situ measurements, conducting field experiments, processing high resolution satellite imagery, modeling, and utilizing geographic information systems.  The project will produce an integrated social and ecological science analysis incorporating a georeferenced land-use/land-cover change projection model.<br/><br/>This project will provide new insights into the processes that govern suburbanization, water use, nitrogen cycling, shellfish productivity, and their interactions.  These dynamics constitute a pressing national problem for coastal zone managers, land owners and water managers.  The significance of this research is manifest by its products, which will include a set of quantitative estimates of spatial and temporal trends in suburbanization and in three of its consequences: sense of place, water use, and waste and fertilizer management.  The project also will result in an assessment of likely human responses to these consequences; advances in quantifying river channel-floodplain connectivity to track changes in nitrogen cycling associated with human activities; and improved modeling of estuarine eutrophication and shellfish productivity in response to upstream changes in nitrogen cycling.  Integrating across these subactivities, a set of georeferenced and validated scenarios of future land use and land cover will be generated, thereby enabling the investigators to make statements about the likely future vulnerability of the coupled system to continued status quo suburbanization patterns.  These products each represent new contributions to the fields of land-use and land-cover change, aquatic ecosystem ecology, and geographic information science.  Together, these products will help advance basic understanding of coupled human-environment vulnerabilities to the effects of multiple, interacting stressors.  The researchers will produce results that interest not only scholars but also suburbanizing communities.  Results will be conveyed directly to relevant government and planning organizations and advocacy groups in an end-of-project stakeholder symposium.

Expanding agriculture and more extensive forms of land use lead to degradation and fragmentation of natural forest habitats, impacting flora and fauna and altering ecological processes.  A changing climate may lead to additional impacts on forests and agricultural land, thereby inducing people to alter practices and engage is even more extensive land-use practices.  The establishment of parks has been a major mechanism used to protect remaining tropical forest biodiversity, particularly in regions with high human densities.  This juxtaposition of biodiversity preservation and land-use extensification in hotspots greatly challenges both the intentions of conservation infrastructure and efforts to alleviate poverty.  Quantifying where these areas (hotter hotspots) occur on the landscape, and analyzing how local people perceive and respond to impacts is fundamental to understanding and facing this dual challenge.  The exploratory research project will be framed around a single question:  How and where has land use intensified around parks in the Albertine Rift of eastern Africa over time?  To help answer this question, a multidisciplinary team of investigators will quantify the rate and extent of forest conversion surrounding seven Ugandan parks to identify patterns of land-use change and extensification as a function of climate, land use, and population change over the last decade.  They will conduct their investigation at both a regional and local scale, incorporating household-level survey data to explore impacts of and responses to land-use change and extensification.  Major project objectives are to quantify the extent and pattern of land-cover change; to quantify climate trajectory and variability; to identify risks and land-use strategies of local people; and to integrate and analyze the complex relationships among demographic changes on the landscape, household perceptions of forest use (including risks), objective measurements of those characteristics, and patterns of change.<br/><br/>The project will provide a quantitative assessment of extent and rate of Albertine Rift forest conversion and agricultural extensification as related to climate and population change.  While conservation hotspots have been pinpointed at large scales, this project will improve their resolution and offer individual assessments of parks within a hotspot region.  The project also will provide new insights regarding how dynamic landscape respond to human-related activities as local scales as well as how those changes relate to climate change and perceptions of risk, all of which are essential for developing frameworks of complex interactions for park-edge interfaces.

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies.  At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways.  The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact.  This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century.  With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system.  This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation.  Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems.  This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives.  A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic.  Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i.  Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture.  The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies.  The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i.  School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting.

This research program will address the following overarching question:  What explains the variation in performance of small-scale fisheries and associated coastal marine ecosystems?  Performance is evaluated in terms of resource productivity, economic yield, sustainability of human activities and communities, and persistence of marine populations and ecosystems.  Specific questions to be addressed include: (1) What are the relative roles and feedbacks between environmental variability and human institutions in determining the performance of small-scale fisheries?  (2) How do feedbacks among biophysical and human components of small-scale fisheries vary across spatial (local to regional) and temporal (year-to-year vs. decadal) scales?  (3) What fisheries management systems are more robust to uncertainty?

It will integrate socioeconomic, ecological, and oceanographic approaches to produce predictive models of the spatial and temporal dynamics of small-scale fisheries.  Second, this research program will provide graduate training in modeling and integrated social and ecological field approaches to studying human-natural systems.

Researchers will assemble and synthesize existing physical, biological, economic, and anthropological data needed for parameterizing models and testing the model assumptions following the first workshop.

First, it will provide a holistic scientific understanding of the interactions between small-scale fisheries and their resources.  Second, it will provide a better understanding of the drivers and consequences of human impacts in the coastal marine environment.  Third, Baja California is a region of extraordinary productivity and biological diversity, currently considered one of the highest priorities for international conservation efforts.  The study will provide a modeling framework for predicting the outcomes of new and future use of coastal resources in Baja California, including anticipated increases in population densities and coastal development in the region, and will start building a theoretical framework more broadly applicable to small-scale fisheries worldwide.  In addition to enhancing fundamental scientific understandings, the project also offers prospects for practical implementation regarding the management of abalone and fisheries in the study region.

BU typically occurs near water bodies, especially near stagnant water, such as slow-flowing rivers, ponds, swamps, and lakes.  In Ghana, more than 11,000 cases have been counted since 1993, the second highest rate in Africa.  The large majority of BU cases are reported for children and women.  While the clinical dimensions of the development of the ulcer on the human skin are well understood, the natural reservoir, activation, and transmission of the bacterium remain unknown, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to label BU as an """"intriguing disease.""""  Several studies have confirmed the linkage between BU and disturbed environments, especially in association with flooding.  Environmental disturbances and landscape modifications may play a major role in the creation of stagnant water and the occurrence of the disease, but little research has focused on the linkages between human-related land disturbance or fragmentation and BU outbreaks.  This interdisciplinary research project will focus on Ghana as a case study and will explore role of environmental change and the emergence of BU at multiple temporal and spatial scales.  The investigators hypothesize that BU outbreaks are triggered by increased systems vulnerability resulting from exogenous disturbance in the form of more extreme and frequent rainfall events and slow drivers of landscape change due to deforestation, agriculture, and mining activities.  Project objectives are to enhance basic understanding of the role and types of land disturbance on BU outbreak; identify overlooked yet potentially critical nonlinearities and surprises resulting from the interaction of human and natural factors on the landscape and subsequent disease emergence; add to the ongoing debate on BU reservoirs, host(s), and transmission; and contribute to the growing body of literature and scientific discourse regarding emerging infectious disease and ecological change, with emphasis on climatic extremes.

The models of forest structure will be hierarchically arrayed, beginning with the dynamics of tree growth and distribution and work up to the stand and landscape scales.  Changes in forest cover affect ecological processes and functions, leading to predictable changes in water quantity and quality.  Human behaviors will be simulated using multi-agent models, and they will be coupled to the forest models through linkages that describe different forms of disturbance of human activities on forest and hydrologic system functions and by receiving feedbacks about the effects of such actions from the forest and hydrological models.  Information about the values driving human decision making will be obtained through empirical social-science research, including survey questionnaires.  The dynamics of the coupled natural and human systems will be analyzed mathematically to identify complex behavior (such as oscillations and """"chaos"""") resulting from the interaction of the human and natural systems.

The spatial extent of this zone is about three times the target goal of the national Hypoxia Action Plan.  The scientific assessment of causes and consequences of these hypoxic conditions indicates that both nitrogen and phosphorous loadings from the Upper Mississippi River Basin and Ohio River Basin stream systems are significant contributors to the size and duration of the zone.  Land use, primarily from agriculture, is a key driver of these nutrient loadings and is the result of decisions made by more than 500,000 individual producers in those river basins.  However, understanding the biogeochemical processes alone is insufficient to understanding the dynamics of this complex system.  This project takes a fresh look at the natural and human dynamics of this enormous system by developing integrated and data-rich models that capture the spatial and temporal non-linearity associated with scaling up the impacts from individuals to the watershed under different scenarios.  The research will produce the first complete modeling system that traces agricultural land-use decisions, made at the field scale in the Upper Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Basins through both environmental and hydrologic components, to downstream water quality effects, including the size of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico.  Uniquely, the modeling effort will incorporate feedbacks via the market, and feedbacks via public policy in the form of adaptive management.  This project will demonstrate how to integrate human and natural process models using the powerful tools of evolutionary algorithms. <br/><br/>Hypoxia is a growing environmental problem for coastal habitats elsewhere in the United States and many other countries.  The development of a general modeling framework from this research will provide an effective tool for the design and implementation of policy to address both Gulf hypoxia and water quality concerns, and identify cost-effective placement of conservation practices within the landscape.

On a global scale, the consequence of intensive food production is closely linked to the health and stability of both biophysical and human systems.  In the Midwestern U.S., the almost-complete replacement of perennial-dominated vegetation by annual crops has significantly impacted environmental services that maintain function and stability of both the human and biophysical systems.  The possibility that these trends can be reversed through the re-introduction of perennial vegetation into agricultural landscapes is underscored by two parallel processes:  (1) the increasing emphasis of agricultural policies on promoting conservation practices that incorporate perennial plants, and (2) increasing evidence from field and modeling studies suggesting that increasing perennial cover may significantly enhance both ecological and socioeconomic benefits.  Fundamental scientific knowledge is sorely lacking, however, with respect to the complex causes and feedbacks within the human and biophysical systems that will ultimately determine the degree and direction of these changes in perennial-annual systems.  This project will integrate a watershed-scale field experiment with modeling simulations to assess coupled ecological and socioeconomic dynamics and trade-offs associated with integrating perennial vegetation in agroecosystems dominated by annual crops in the Midwest.  The project will be conducted at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in the Walnut Creek watershed in central Iowa, where approximately one-third of the watershed has been converted to native prairie vegetation, producing a mosaic landscape of agricultural lands and native prairie vegetation that provides an ideal context for this research.  The core hypothesis for this research is that strategic locations, amounts, and types of perennial plant cover within agriculturally-dominated landscapes will have a disproportionate effect on the functioning of the biophysical (i.e., water quality and flow, biodiversity) and socioeconomic (i.e., quality of life, economic and social stability) systems.  The main objective of this project is to develop an environmental-efficiency index derived from baseline economic and biophysical data that will enable assessment of the extent to which different landscape designs having contrasting annual-perennial plant configurations optimize ecosystem functioning and socioeconomic benefits.  This project will include parameterizing, validating, and explicitly linking biophysical and economic models that will be used to assess the environmental benefits and economic costs of various perennial-annual watershed scenarios.<br/><br/>This project will have significant impacts on science and society by developing novel approaches to assessing biocomplexity in agricultural landscapes and by providing knowledge that will contribute to policies aimed at effecting positive environmental and socioeconomic change.  The project will result in a prototypic decision-making tool that can be applied by a range of governmental agencies and civil society organizations to guide management and policy decisions, thereby offering a scientific basis for assessing trade-offs of alternative intensively managed landscapes.  It will establish a scientific understanding of the full societal costs and benefits of integrating perennial vegetation into annually dominated agricultural systems and of the complex dynamics currently influencing adoption and payments of conservation practices that is needed for more effective policy formulation.  The project will enhance knowledge of biocomplexity of intensively managed systems and alternative watershed design options within society as a whole by providing educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as through public education and outreach activities conducted through the refuge's learning center that will target a wide range of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, school children, farmers, etc.).  The results and approach developed through this project will have broad applications to assessing trade-offs of alternative intensively managed landscapes and guiding management and policy decisions in other regions in the U.S. and abroad.

These transformations have reduced and fragmented natural habitat, resulting in loss of biodiversity and many ecosystem services.  Maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while meeting the needs of human society for food, fiber, fuel, and other essentials requires integrated assessment of the biological and economic consequences of land use and land management.  This interdisciplinary research project will develop and apply an integrated dynamic landscape-modeling approach to predict and compare how alternative policy incentives and market forces affect land-use decisions; how resulting land-use changes affect species conservation, carbon storage, and the value of commodity production; and how this will affect future land-use decisions.  The investigators will approach these questions by developing statistical models based on observed landowner behavior in order to predict likely land-use changes as a function of current land-use conditions, public policy, and market opportunities.  Land-use changes have consequences for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic returns.  Land-use patterns shaped by these decisions will serve as input into models that predict the status of species, the flow of ecosystem services, and the value of commodity production from the landscape.  Current land-use decisions and the resulting set of consequences will set the stage for future conditions that shape future policies and market opportunities, which, in turn, will affect future land-use changes.  This integrated approach will be used to analyze the likely effect of alternative policies on land-use change dynamics, the consequent trajectory for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic activities on the landscape.  The integrated dynamic landscape modeling approach will be applied to landscapes at several geographic scales, from the 48 contiguous states to regional analysis applied to the Willamette Basin in Oregon and the Northern Lakes Region in Wisconsin.  Two questions will be addressed by using different scales of analysis within the same modeling approach:  (1) How much difference does inclusion of increased detail and spatial resolution make to the analysis and results?, and (2) Can analyses be nested in the sense that one can use the broad-scale analysis to highlight areas and species of concern, at which point more detailed analysis can be undertaken using finer scale analysis?<br/><br/>Conserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem services necessary for human welfare in the long-run in the midst of a growing human economy with pressing current needs requires careful planning based on an understanding of the full set of consequences of human choices and actions.  This project will integrate economic and ecological research into a coherent framework to predict landscape dynamics and the effects of these dynamics on biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and economic production.  The integrated landscape model developed in this project will provide tools and insights that can be used to improve decision making by a broad range of stakeholders.  By facilitating careful thinking about the pattern, extent, and intensity of human activities across the landscape through time, this project may help landowners and policy makers to achieve important species conservation and ecosystem service objectives while also generating high economic returns over the long term.

This project will integrate theory and data from oceanography, biology, and social sciences to address major questions about the design of marine reserve networks. The researchers plan to establish a general theoretical framework with linked circulation, population, habitat, and socioeconomic submodels. This structure will allow systematic exploration of several core questions, including: (1) what are the crucial cascades and feedbacks among physical, biological, and social systems that influence how reserve networks function? (2) What are the roles of different stakeholder groups, such as various fisher groups, local residents, tourists, etc, in this network function? and (3) how compatible are network systems based largely on criteria to promote local acceptability of reserves versus those more centrally optimized around biophysical criteria? In all questions, network function will be addressed through the effects on fisheries,<br/>biodiversity, and social/cultural systems. In this way, The analyses will be able to directly address and compare a range of common network goals.<br/><br/>The project will revolve around the development of a series of integrated models with<br/>increasing spatial complexity and the acquisition of data to parameterize them. The modeling will start with analytical models and will then extend to spatially explicit (e.g., grid-based) and realistic (e.g., map-based) versions. Data collection will initially focus on intensive mining of published literature and databases for existing information, followed by targeted field work, including habitat mapping, surveys of species - habitat relationships, sampling for population genetic structure, and ethnographic studies of stakeholders. Models and data will eventually be incorporated into a dynamic GIS spatial-simulation tool- allowing users to run network design and management experiments via interactive simulation. This product will be made available to researchers, educators, and managers interested in the analysis of reserve network function.<br/>The researchers, distributed among multiple institutions, are adopting the Bahamas as their study system. This country, an archipelago of hundreds of island, is currently in the political process of expanding their set of marine protected areas (MPAs) into an interconnected network of marine reserves (to include up to 40 sites). Because of this, several Bahamas government and conservation agencies are welcoming scientific contributions to their policy-making discussions. In comparison to many other Caribbean countries, marine resources in the Bahamas also remain relatively intact because of the county's large size and relatively small population. The country's close proximity to Florida also makes it logistically feasible for project researchers to conduct fieldwork while remaining in close contact with their home institutions and other project collaborators.<br/><br/>This project, taking advantage of special opportunities in the Bahamas, will develop new understanding about global phenomena- the anthropogenic degradation of reef ecosystems and the paradigmatic turn to marine reserves for better resource management. In exploring these concerns and answering the questions above, we also plan to support ongoing decision-making and educational activities in the Bahamas. This double strategy exemplifies the role of strategic (versus traditionally defined basic or applied) science to elucidate important processes while helping to solve problems. The proposed work will also have substantial educational spin-offs in both the US and the Bahamas. Informal education products, including multimedia presentations and web-base materials will be produced and disseminated by the museum. In addition, researchers will work with partner organizations in the Bahamas to develop project-related materials for teacher training and college courses.<br/>"

Crop gene flow is the result of both natural processes like wind dispersal of pollen and human processes like the planting of seeds in fields.  Theoretical and empirical studies have focused on gene flow at the local and landscape scale, but they generally have neglected gene flow on the global scale.  The controversy surrounding the unintended movement of engineered genes (transgenes) has raised awareness that new alleles can move rapidly and over great distances.  No models have emerged to evaluate the spread of crop transgenes through both natural and human processes over time and space, nor have human impacts on gene flow been explored yet.  This interdisciplinary research project will focus on the development of an integrated model to describe the dynamics of dispersal of a new crop transgene in space and time.  A benefit of focusing on transgene flow is that it affords examples of alleles whose age and origins are known.  The model will evolve with iterative interactions between three research teams.  The initial model will use corn (Zea mays, maize) in the U.S. and Mexico as a model system, but the model eventually will be adapted for other crop systems, such as canola.  Furthermore, the project will move beyond the initial two-nation focus to explore transgene spread at the global scale.  One research team will have the construction of the model as its primary assignment.  The model will start with a structure of simple natural dispersal processes.  The other two teams will make conceptual contributions for refining the model, such as (1) natural processes that affect dispersal patterns like wind directionality, timing of plant flowering, and the spatial distribution of cross-compatible wild relatives, and (2) human processes that affect dispersal patterns like farmer management and choice of seeds for replanting or transport of seed through local and international trade.  Those teams will also contribute novel data and pre-existing data from the literature for modifying and testing the model.  The teams then will evaluate the refined model for (1) natural impacts, such as the evolution of weediness or the loss of biodiversity in wild relatives, and (2) human impacts, such as evolution of trade policy in response to unintended transgenes in the food supply or changes in traditionally based agricultural systems precipitated by the presence of transgenes in local varieties.  New gene-flow influences resulting from these consequences will then be incorporated into the model.  Examples include (1) the spatial spread of the transgene into expanding weed populations and (2) international trade barriers or changing labor migration patterns.  The evolutionary results from the model will be compared with real spatial and temporal changes in corn transgene frequencies in Mexico.  Regular meetings of the research teams will serve to improve the integrative model while providing new opportunities to scrutinize the constraints and consequences of dispersal.  The final product will be a global model that can be generalized to describe for the spread of any plant allele as constrained by human and natural processes.<br/><br/>The project will have significant implications for predicting plant gene dispersal under natural and human dispersal.  It will thus have implications for the spread of invasive organisms as well as for its focus of transgene flow.  The topic of transgene flow is a part of the greater public discussion of genetic engineering.  The results of the project will have direct relevance to addressing critical issues like the unintended spread of engineered genes that have been reported occurring adventitiously in non-engineered crop varieties, in Mexican corn despite a multiyear moratorium against planting transgenic corn in that country, and in natural populations.  The results of this study therefore will provide that scientific input to inform both lay audiences and policy makers at both the national and international levels.

The consumption of methane by a specific group of soil bacteria (methanotrophs) is a key part of the global methane budget, with temperate grasslands contributing an important fraction.  Although current models for atmospheric methane treat this consumption as constant, there is clear evidence that its rate varies with climate, suggesting that future climate change may alter its magnitude.  The overall goal of this work is to improve understanding of methane uptake so that its response to climate change can be better predicted.  Efforts to achieve this overall goal are broken down into 3 objectives.  First, the investigators will collect field data on methane uptake and its controls from study sites that cover the climatic diversity of the North American Great Plains grasslands.  Second, the investigators will quantify the controls on methane uptake with laboratory assays on soils from these sites.  Much of the climate sensitivity of methane uptake hinges on the way that the methanotrophic bacteria respond to variation in soil temperature and moisture, and there is evidence that this environmental sensitivity differs from one methanotroph species to another.  Thus, this second objective requires measuring how the environmental sensitivity of methanotrophs varies among study sites where different methanotroph species are present.  Finally, the investigators will statistically evaluate their field and laboratory findings and use them to develop a new type of predictive model for methane uptake that incorporates the importance of methanotroph species differences.<br/><br/>This study will address a fundamental question about the importance of bacterial diversity in affecting the way that ecosystems work.  It is well recognized that, for example, cactus, pine trees and grasses respond differently to drought stress, but the responses of different bacterial species to environmental change are poorly understood.  Thus, even though a number of studies have now documented that soil bacterial species vary from place to place, it remains difficult to predict how these changes in diversity affect the way that ecosystems function.  This project also will contribute to workforce development by training and employing post-doctoral students, a graduate student and more than 10 undergraduate students.  The research will not only engage students from undergraduate institutions (Augustana College, SD) and R-1 research universities (Colorado State, University of Nebraska), but will enhance networking between faculty at these institutions, and will include recruitment of Hispanic-American undergraduate students from CSU-Pueblo to participate in summer research activities."

Environmental markets now span air and water pollution, fishing quotas, endangered species habitat, wetlands, and streams.  In a market for water pollution, for example, a regulator specifies the total amount of emissions, but the individual emissions by various sources are determined by trading in the market.  Each environmental market is defined by a particular spatial scale, that is, the size of the geographic region over which trades are allowed to take place.  In practice, there is substantial variation in spatial scale.  The sulfur dioxide market encompasses the continental U.S., yet markets for water pollution are often constrained to relatively local watersheds.  Despite this observed variation, little research has examined whether the scale of a given market is environmentally and economically optimal.  Determining the optimal scale of a pollution emissions market necessitates the simultaneous analysis of economic costs of firms complying with pollution reduction; spatial pattern of pollution and corresponding damages to ecosystems and human populations; and the behavior of humans in the marketplace, particularly the ability to manipulate prices.  This collaborative research project will integrate all three of these factors and determine the optimal spatial scale for nitrogen pollution trading in North Carolina's Neuse River basin.  A theoretical economic model that combines compliance costs and human behavior will determine the spatial pattern of emissions of nitrogen from wastewater treatment plants.  This model will be coupled with a hydrological and biogeochemical model that maps emissions into a spatial distribution of water quality.  A series of economic laboratory experiments will be conducted to test the predictions of the economics model.  The experiments also will analyze the degree to which feedback about compliance costs and the spatial distribution of water quality mitigates price manipulation.  Using these elements, the investigators will analyze various spatial scales and select the one that yields the greatest net benefits to society.<br/><br/>The most immediate impact of this study is the market design for the Neuse river basin.  This will inform the future debate over North Carolina water quality regulation.  The general principles will be directly applicable to similar local water quality regulations, such as the market for nitrogen trading in the Long Island Sound.  The study project will impact water quality regulation more broadly.  It will provide a framework to compare the current water quality regulation as specified by the Clean Water Act to an alternative framework based on the optimal spatial scale.  The project also will influence the design of more general environmental regulation as its methodology provides a template for analyzing the optimal spatial scale of many other environmental markets.

The arctic region has warmed significantly over the past 30 years and arctic lands and freshwaters are already changing in response. The changes include a general """"greening"""" of the arctic landscape, changes in species distributions and abundance, and changes in geophysical and biogeochemical processes and cycles at local and regional scales. Since 1975, the ARC LTER project and its predecessors have studied these changes by long-term monitoring of tundra and freshwater ecosystems in relation to climate change, by experimental manipulations of whole tundra, lake, and stream ecosystems, and by comparisons among climatically different sites in northern Alaska and throughout the Arctic. Increasingly, however, it is apparent that climatic warming in the Arctic is accompanied by dramatic changes in disturbance regime, including disturbances related to thawing of permafrost, a surprising increase in wildfire, and changes in the seasonality and synchrony of ecosystem processes. These disturbances, in addition to having major impacts on biogeochemistry, populations, and communities, also lead to major changes in surface energy balance, surface temperatures, water balance, and heat transfer into the permafrost that lies beneath the tundra, lakes, and streams. The result is much more dramatic and rapid change in biota and element cycles than is predicted in response to warming alone. In the long term, warming-related changes in disturbance regime may be more important than the direct effects of warming on arctic tundra and freshwater ecosystems, and on the entire Arctic. Over the next six years the ARC LTER project will address these issues in an integrated landscape framework, viewing the Arctic landscape as a spatially linked system including tundra, streams, and lakes and leading to long-term predictions of change at hillslope, watershed, and regional scales. The long-term goal, to develop a predictive understanding of the landscape of Northern Alaska including tundra, streams, lakes, and their interactions, remains the same but efforts for the next six years will include a new emphasis on changing disturbance regimes and their interactions with climate change. This refocusing will involve some shifts in effort, away from long-term experiments manipulating individual climatic, biotic, and biogeochemical drivers, and toward increased effort on characterizing disturbances including thermokarst, fire, and changing seasonality, and on new research focused on landscape linkages and physical disturbance. New areas of research will include changes in surface energy exchange and heat flux into permafrost, and a program on climate change impacts and responses by local Native Alaskan communities.<br/><br/>The scientific impacts of this research are much broader than improvement of the ability to predict ecosystem structure, function, and change in Northern Alaska. The role of disturbance in long-term change is of broad theoretical and empirical interest in ecology and is closely related to controls on resilience, tipping points, and thresholds in populations, communities, ecosystems, and complex landscapes. The landscape near Toolik Lake, Alaska is an excellent model system for analysis of these issues at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Work at Toolik Lake will provide a multidimensional view of how responses of tundra and freshwater ecosystems to environmental change can feed back, both positively and negatively, on the factors driving the change. This is of broad importance both theoretically and from the perspective of global climatic change. A multifaceted education program will include: a Schoolyard project of lectures and inquiry in the largely Native Alaskan town of Barrow, Alaska; field courses in Arctic Ecology and in Polar Science for Journalists; and undergraduate and graduate research and degree programs. Research at the ARC LTER will benefit society as a case study of a landscape where local, subsistence land use is still common and important, and where climate change and its impacts are felt directly in the delivery of key ecosystem services."

The goal of the investigators conducting this project is to discover configurations of diversity in ecological landscapes and in forms of social organization that make systems more or less able to cope with significant  environmental or social changes without undergoing an unpleasant transformation.  The researchers will focus on a few important variables indicating both social diversity (integration, conformity, and hierarchy) and ecological diversity (diversity of plant and animal species and of patches on the landscape).  To understand the relationships of interest, they will develop mathematical models of the interactions of key variables and conduct extensive quantitative analysis of data from empirical studies of millennium-long societal trajectories.  They will examine five archaeological cases from the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico as long-term """"experiments"""" to see how diversity in the social and ecological realms affected these societies' abilities to thrive or forced them into dramatic transformations when faced with different environmental or social stimuli.  The outcomes of these analyses will provide the basis for dynamic modeling designed to investigate the broad range of conditions in which these domains of diversity contribute to varying responses to change across different time scales.

The effects predicted by the modeling then will be explored with respect to the empirical details of the case studies. <br/><br/>Insights about diversity in contemporary research on interacting social and ecological systems have overwhelmingly relied upon studies and observations over short time spans.  This project's emphasis on case-specific, comparative analysis of long-term, regional-scale archaeological sequences in the Americas will yield new perspectives regarding important episodes in human history.  This project will demonstrate the value of integrating insights from ecology and archaeology, the importance of balancing concerns for social and ecological processes, and the ability of archaeology to contribute to understanding the role of diversity in the resilience of social-ecological systems.  As societies cope with inevitable change, their actions generate vulnerabilities.  Lack of awareness of these dynamics can contribute to the need for costly transformations.  When made more aware of the complex dynamics of change as they have functioned in the past, people can better weigh the implications of their decisions and build resilience to such vulnerabilities.  This project will demonstrate how interactions associated with social and ecological diversity can inform contemporary policies dealing with sustainability, robustness, vulnerability, and transformative change.  This project also will enhance education from pre-collegiate through graduate levels as students and teachers integrate knowledge derived from both the social and natural sciences and benefit from primary datasets of richly documented social and ecological analyses of diversity.

Long-term interactions among social and ecological processes give rise to complex dynamics on multiple temporal and spatial scales -- cycles of change followed by relative stasis and then a new cycle of change.  Within the cycles are understandable patterns and irreducible uncertainties.  Neither stability nor transformation can be taken as the norm.  Although these cycles can be identified, it remains uncertain what fosters stability or contributes to transformation over long cycles.  What vulnerabilities can be tolerated, and which tip a system into transformation and at what scale?  Resilience theorists have built an understanding of social and ecological vulnerabilities, stability, and transformation based on studies of contemporary socioecological systems.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine some of these understandings by applying archaeological and ecological analyses and formal dynamical modeling.  The project will be undertaken by a collaboration of archaeologists, mathematical modelers, ecologists, and environmental scientists.  Archaeology is attuned to cycles of change over the lifespan of a society -- heightened inter-societal interaction, economic intensification, and large-scale anthropogenic environmental change .  It therefore extends scientific observation of stability and transformation beyond all social memory. Archaeologically documented case studies in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico provide the information for investigating long-term human-environmental interactions.  The project will (1) compile documentation on up to four archaeological cases, (2) examine their pan-regional connections, and (3) employ mathematical modeling and subsequent archaeological and ecological analysis to abstract the key variables and processes underlying periods of cultural stability and both rapid and protracted transformations.  The empirical investigations provide substantive contexts for the models, while the models will foster insight into generalizations that are then examined in empirical contexts.  This iterative process is expected to lead to insights that could not be derived from any single approach, nor can they be derived from the short time span available in contemporary study of social or ecological change.<br/><br/>This project will influence the refinement of theory and understanding of processes of socioecological change.  First, an intensive collaboration of archaeologists specializing in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico will contribute a new level of understanding of the social and environmental interactions underlying important episodes in human history.  Second, through archaeology's deep time perspective, this project will examine the utility of resilience theory as applied to coupled socioecological systems, demonstrate the value of archaeology to ecological theory, and further scientific understanding of current socioecological problems through refinement of concepts and theory.  Third, this project will identify the dynamics of transformation and stability as conditioned by cultural and environmental contexts, strategies for coping with uncertainty, and varying constraints of long-term legacies.  This project is expected to promote awareness of some of the human strategies for dealing with uncertainty and change as well as awareness of how human actions leave legacies of resilience or degradation.  In addition, this project will immerse students in an interdisciplinary research community that will spark development of professional skills and encourage them to exchange knowledge about coupled human and environmental systems.  The involvement of students and researchers from the U.S., Mexico, France, and the many nations represented in the Resilience Alliance will foster global perspectives and international collaborations.

Researchers have characterized this fit in terms of the close feedbacks that enable a system to function well when faced with a known set of disturbance regimes. This project addresses a key question that naturally arises when these systems are exposed to a new set of disturbance regimes or novel change as is likely to occur with increased globalization and climate change: to what extent do the interdependencies that developed to strengthen the system's capacity to fit to a certain set of disturbances limit or enhance its capacity to refit to new conditions?  To address this question, the project team will focus on a particular class of CNHs - small scale irrigation systems where the built infrastructure plays a critical role in resource provision. A multi-method approach will be employed that begins with the qualitative analysis of a large number of case studies to develop a typology of irrigation systems. A subset of previously examined exemplar cases will be revisited to examine how they have coped with new vulnerabilities that have emerged. In parallel, field experiments will be conducted with resource users and infrastructure providers that apply principles of behavioral economics to social dilemmas that emerge in irrigation systems in order to test the robustness of collective action to different stressors. These will be followed by laboratory experiments with college students to examine whether the findings can be generalized to other systems. Finally, insights from the case studies and experiments will be used to develop formal dynamic models of prototypical irrigation-based CNHs. Using tools from dynamical systems and robust control complemented by numerical experiments and simulation (including agent-based approaches), the qualitative dynamics and associated robustness-vulnerability characteristics of these systems will be studied in order to distill a set of institutional design principles for use in the development of tools for anticipatory governance.<br/><br/>In addition to the study of coupled natural human systems (CNHs) in its own right, this project is motivated by an important practical consideration. The pace at which social and natural systems are currently changing - driven to a large degree by globalization and climate change - has challenged the capacity of several CNHs to self-organize and respond effectively to this change. Ongoing field studies have shown that small scale farms (less than 2 hectares), which constitute 90% of farms worldwide and consume an estimated 70% of developed water supplies, are the most vulnerable to such changes. Since these farms also produce 40% of agricultural output globally and support the majority of world?s poorest people, it is essential to enhance their adaptive capacity in order to maintain food security and alleviate poverty. Focusing on the in-depth study of small-scale irrigation systems, this project pushes ideas of resource governance beyond traditional approaches. Rather than seeking the """"best"""" policies for a specific system under a given set of shocks, it seeks to understand how CNHs cope with change under a wide range of disturbance regimes. The theoretical foundation for the project is based on a key insight from engineering: feedback (of which management and governance in CNHs are examples) can be used to stabilize a system and reduce its sensitivity to a given set of disturbances. However, this stabilizing feedback can increase sensitivity to new types of disturbances. By studying responses to a suite of disturbances, this project helps advance a more nuanced understanding of evolution of CNHs in terms of recognizing how in becoming finely-tuned to certain disturbances, systems become increasingly vulnerable to others. Building on this insight through theoretical modelling as well as case studies and field experiments from a wide variety of settings in the southwestern US, India, Nepal and Thailand, this project will develop a set of tools that will contribute to the capacity of policy makers to better anticipate emerging vulnerabilities and design learning and adaptive mechanisms to cope more effectively with change."

Understanding the interdependent behavior of social and natural systems and the factors that affect how these linked systems respond to sudden natural or political-economic shocks or ongoing stresses is a major challenge for science.  Resilience is the ability of a system to absorb or adapt to change without altering its basic parts and functions.  An important line of research therefore is to investigate the resilience of coupled human-natural systems in the face of major stresses and to understand how environmental governance, including both formal policies and informal institutions, affects resilience.  Previously developed theories suggest that local resource-management institutions may contribute to resilience and enable communities to adapt more successfully to climate change.  Mongolia is an ideal place to test this theory because it has experienced one of the most significant warming trends on Earth over the past 40 years.  Furthermore, more than 2,000 community-based rangeland management organizations have formed in Mongolia since 1999, an unprecedented social experiment that creates an opportunity for rigorous policy learning.  This interdisciplinary research project will assess the vulnerability of Mongolian pastoral social-ecological systems to climate change, evaluate the effects of community-based rangeland management on the resilience of Mongolian pastoral systems, strengthen linkages between science and policy making in Mongolia, and build the capacity of participating Mongolian and U.S. researchers and students to analyze the dynamics of complex coupled natural-human systems.  The investigators will use a range of methods in this project, include remote sensing and climate and hydrological modeling to assess changes in climate and land use over time and the effects of those changes on rangeland hydrology and productivity.  They will use observational approaches like interviews, household surveys, and plant and livestock field sampling to compare ecological, social, and resilience indicators in districts with community-based management and those without, and they will conduct targeted grazing removal experiments to improve understanding of the relative importance of weather and grazing in determining pasture conditions in different ecological zones.  Data will be analyzed and integrated using a combination of statistics, statistical and process modeling, and geospatial 3-D visualization techniques.  The project will educate and train graduate students and secondary school teachers in the U.S. and Mongolia and will directly involve stakeholders and policy makers through participatory system modeling and scenario planning workshops.<br/><br/>By examining the performance and outcomes of community-based institutions in rangelands using a large-sample, case-control design that accounts for variation in ecological and regional contexts, this project will contribute significantly to basic understanding of community-based rangeland management institutions in Mongolia and elsewhere.

Climate variability is one of the top sources of risk to agricultural production.  In particular, climate fluctuations on seasonal-to-interannual and interdecadal scales are relevant to decision-making, resource management, and infrastructure planning.  On seasonal-to-interannual scales, the emerging ability to forecast regional climate variability associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon offers a natural laboratory to learn how a complex system such as agriculture may respond.  An excellent site to study such responses is the Pampas of central-eastern Argentina, a major agricultural region that shows marked interannual and interdecadal climate signals.  On interdecadal scales, an increase in spring-summer precipitation since the 1970s has contributed to significant changes in land-use patterns and a large increase in Argentine agricultural output.  There are growing concerns about the environmental consequences and the sustainability of production and life support systems, however.  This interdisciplinary research project will address these issues, which are part of the dynamic interactions of natural and human components in agroecosystems.  Special emphasis will be placed on assessing the scope for adaptive management in response to newly available knowledge on climate variability and recent insights on human decision making.  The project will (1) map key components of the decision landscape in agricultural systems of the Pampas; (2) build plausible scenarios of interannual and interdecadal climate variability; (3) assess impacts and outcomes of climate variability; (4) seek to understand how probabilistic climate information and uncertainty about outcomes are received and acted upon; (5) explore best practices for the design and communication of climate information and the characterization of uncertainty; (6) assess consequences on natural systems of human actions; and (7) conduct a self-reflective analysis of factors that promote or impede integrative science research and outreach with stakeholder participation.  The project involves linked modeling approaches for generation of climate scenarios and decision outcomes, controlled experiments on decision making and behavior, and participatory research that will draw on contextual knowledge and agricultural stakeholders' experiences and preferences.<br/><br/>The link between climate variability and decision making is a fundamental issue that influences resource management in many regions and sectors.  This project will provide an integrated analysis of an important and prevalent complex system (agricultural production) that involves interactions between several natural and human systems.  From a perspective of scientific innovation, the project will develop conceptual and procedural approaches to bridge the spatial and temporal scales of climate scenarios and the scales associated with regional impact assessment and resource management.  Scale mismatch has been at the heart of problems of climate impact assessment.  The project will include a fully probabilistic characterization of uncertainty based on modern statistical and computational techniques.  The availability of uncertainty estimates will enhance the salience of project findings for stakeholders.  Finally, a reflective analysis of the challenges of interdisciplinary, multiple-place collaboration, and stakeholder involvement in integrative science will stimulate theory development relevant to biocomplexity problems elsewhere.  The similarity in production scale, crops grown, and technology of the Pampas to those in other major production areas (such as the U.S. Midwest, Brazil, and Canada) with comparable climate signals suggest a broader relevance of results from the project.

One of the major risk sources to agriculture is climate variability.  In many parts of the world, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is the major single source of climate variability on seasonal-to-interannual scales.  Links between ENSO-related climate variability and agricultural production have been established for many regions, including the Pampas of Argentina, a major production region and the geographic focus of the proposed effort.  Recent scientific and technological advances have made it possible to forecast, with moderate skill, ENSO events with a lead time of months. In the agricultural sector, ENSO-related climate forecasts may help to reduce risks of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions.  Simply documenting the effects of climate variability and providing better climate forecasts is not sufficient to derive benefits from the emerging predictive capability, however.  The factors that make many farmers reluctant to respond to climate information requires scientific attention in order to derive significant benefits from to the climate predictions.  This collaborative project between U.S. and Argentine researchers seeks to enhance understandings of the use of probabilistic climate information to support decision making in agricultural production systems; to anticipate and possibly prevent unintended negative societal consequences of climate prediction, and to inform the design of a future operational system to disseminate climate information relevant and useful to decision and policy making in agriculture.  The project will involve planning workshops and preliminary research to inform the planning effort.  Two planning workshops will help to frame the problems to be addressed during the planning process, identify major research needs, and design a detailed plan for future work.  Major issues to be addressed during planning workshops include the major sources of uncertainty in each component of the modeling approach and the identification and explication of the assumptions and limitations associated with all models that are used.

A marked increase in rainfall since the 1970s has contributed to major changes in land use in the Pampas of Argentina, the focus of this study: continuous cropping has widely replaced ecologically-sound agriculture-pasture rotations. Nevertheless, production systems that evolved partly in response to increased rainfall may not be viable if (as is entirely possible) climate reverts to a drier epoch. As there is much uncertainty about projected paths of future climate, particularly on regional scales and short time horizons (25-30 years hence), this project will explore various plausible climate scenarios to anticipate potential impacts on agricultural systems together with advances in agricultural technology that may affect productivity and vulnerability to climate. The central goal of this study is to improve understanding of linkages between agricultural ecosystems, uncertain decadal climate trajectories, technological innovations that decrease vulnerability to climate stresses, human decision-making, and land use and tenure changes over periods of a few decades. To achieve this goal, the investigators will build scenarios of inter-decadal climate variability; assess the impacts of climate variability on current and adapted agricultural production systems; simulate  biological and economic effects of genetically-improved crops tolerant to drought stress; study the diffusion of this technological innovation; (5) develop models of individual decision-making and use these models to assess emerging regional-scale patterns of land use and land tenure and their implications for sustainability of production systems. <br/><br/>Agricultural production involves real-world decisions with important economic consequences, and thus is a useful test bed to understand decision-making in complex natural-human systems.

One highlight of the project is the active involvement of farmers and operational producers of climate information (the Argentine Met Service) that guarantee the relevance of the research, facilitate and demand outreach, and ensures stakeholders'' ownership of the process. Finally, similarity in experienced climate fluctuations, production scale, technology and crops grown, and land tenure regimes of the Pampas to those in the US Midwest suggest a broader relevance of the project''s results."

Previous research has established that strong institutional arrangements, i.e., the rule systems that structure human behavior, are needed for effective forest governance outcomes.  But the specific contextual factors that enable strong institutional arrangements to take form remain a puzzle.   This research directly addresses this puzzle by collecting and analyzing new data on how humans interact with their natural environment.  This project will combine new data collection and advanced analytical methods to rigorously test the hypothesis that the emergence of adaptive governance is critically linked to three factors: local ecological knowledge; cultural values and beliefs, and socioeconomic inequalities.  Data will be collected from 56 community-managed tropical forest ecosystems in Bolivia and Uganda and will focus on the measurement of possible causes and consequences of individual and community decision making about access to and use of forest resources. These data will be generated using a variety of data collection methods, including direct measures of forest composition, satellite imagery, studies of forest user behaviors, household surveys, focus group discussions, and interviews with key informants and decision makers.  Data will be analyzed using system-dynamics models, cross-sectional time-series analysis, and qualitative comparative analysis to determine how the interrelated factors of local ecological knowledge, cultural values and beliefs, and socio-economic inequality within resource user groups affect forest conservation outcomes. <br/> <br/>This research challenges the conventional wisdom that extrinsic incentives, such as direct payments to forest users, will uniformly lead to increased forest conservation, and will produce information on how forest conservation efforts affect forest users' decisions and behavior in a variety of socioeconomic and cultural settings.  This new knowledge will build a more nuanced view of the potential benefits of a global program to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries.  The research is of immediate practical value as organizations around the world struggle to create policies that promote effective natural resource governance."

Urbanization is strongly linked to increasing temperatures through the formation of """"heat islands"""" -  places with higher temperatures due to radiant heat from buildings, concrete, and other human activities. Such local effects are likely to intensify with future trends in global warming. Previous studies have shown that the urban poor are most vulnerable to extreme heat, but little is known about the interplay between changing urban climates and the coupled human-natural systems that amplify or mitigate climate-related hazards for different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups at finer spatial scales of neighborhoods and households. Taking account of global trends in urban growth and climate change, this project investigates the causes of variation in heat-related human vulnerability within the metropolitan region of Phoenix, Arizona. An ideal laboratory for this research, Phoenix has a naturally hot, arid climate. Rapid urbanization has increased average summer nighttime temperature by five degrees Celsius during the past 50 years. The research will explain the character of complex urban heat """"riskscapes"""", assess the vulnerability of people in different neighborhoods to heat-related health hazards, and identify the causes of variation of vulnerability within cities. Ecological, meteorological, sociological, and medical treatment data will be used to build an integrated system dynamics model of vulnerability to climate change that incorporates substantial feedback mechanisms from human adaptations. Researchers will use the model to test hypotheses about complex interactions between human manipulation of the environment and induced climate response, to explore relationships between neighborhood and regional dynamics, and to forecast alternative future scenarios. The results will be used to devise alternative neighborhood landscapes and community coping mechanisms that can reduce vulnerability, and to design programs for teaching and learning about climate and health. Innovative methodological techniques used in this study are developing fine-scale, surface energy balance models for integrating and extending climate research over spatial and temporal scales; combining airborne and satellite remotely sensed data with a meteorological model nested in state-of-the-art global climate model output; conducting spatial analyses of heat riskscapes and heat-related illnesses; and community-participatory research on coping strategies in low-income and minority neighborhoods.<br/><br/>Meeting the challenges of sustainability in a rapidly urbanizing and warming world will depend on decisions that allow humans to control or adapt to rising urban temperatures. This project will identify community and demographic markers of high-risk environments that decision-makers can use to develop spatially informed early warning systems and heat-illness prevention programs. Model projections for the distribution of future heat-related vulnerabilities and human responses that impact particular places and population subgroups are important for cities on several continents because enlarging heat islands, higher temperatures, and associated adverse impacts on health are occurring globally. Model results will be displayed in a visualization environment that will allow stakeholders to examine alternative future vulnerability scenarios; this will make knowledge accessible to the community and promote better decision-making. Educational activities will be designed for low-income and minority populations, including the production of a children's magazine issue on """"people and climate"""" that will reach thousands of households. Local residents, university students, and project investigators will engage in collaborative community-participation research to promote heat-hazard mitigation in inner-city Phoenix neighborhoods.

This work integrates social and ecological sciences to study a fire-prone landscape in central Oregon that includes private, state, federal, and tribal lands.  Our method will combine an established spatially explicit, policy-driven, multiagent model of land management decision-making, models of vegetative succession and fire ignition/spread that can represent climate change effects, and a suite of landscape evaluators of socio-economic and ecological system performance. The project will integrate existing studies of ecosystems with new and ongoing studies characterizing human preferences and values in these landscapes to parameterize the multiagent model with defensible representations of human decision-making. We will extend the application of agent-based models to study how social networks influence landscape dynamics and adaptation, and explore landscape trajectories under alternative policy and climate change scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques to understand variant/invariant aspects of landscape change, land management policy strategies, human preferences, and ecosystem feedbacks. These analyses will help identify management strategies that increase adaptive capacity of these landscapes to respond to uncertain futures. We anticipate this project will: 1) reveal complex system behaviors associated with fire-prone landscapes, 2) improve effectiveness of forest management policies in multiownership fire-prone landscapes,  3) improve understanding of the role of social networks (e.g. fire protection districts and environmental organizations) and economic forces in influencing how landowners and managers make decisions under risk and uncertainty, and 4) improve understanding of how external forces of climate change and carbon markets could affect policy outcomes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.  <br/><br/>Wildland fire policies in the U.S. are fragmented and broken, largely because land and wildfire management policies do not fully consider human and ecological effects. Typically, the fire-prone landscape is divided into a """"wildland-urban interface"""" under the influence of fire management agencies, and a wild landscape under the influence of land managers. These two fire worlds are often seen as socially, economically, and organizationally separate, yet they are clearly part of a single interconnected landscape. Lack of understanding of these connections has lead to policies that are ineffective or even counterproductive. For example, fire suppression can increase the severity of fires and draws resources away from necessary ecological restoration work in wilder parts of the landscape. The problem of adaptation to fire-prone landscapes is even more challenging when climate change and carbon markets are considered. In order to develop more effective policies, we need to improve our understanding of how social systems - networks and institutions - influence behavior in private and public landowners.  This study will develop methods to characterize these social systems and their interactions with the environment, and use this information to explore and test alternative strategies that improve the landscape while minimizing the social and economic costs associated with wildfire."

They hypothesize that net carbon fluxes in these settings are governed by the juxtaposition of physical transport and chemical reaction in the bottom boundary layer.  They will address questions such as how much of the net community carbon production is ultimately sequestered in the ocean interior and how does this happen, how do large, fast-growing coastal diatoms responsible for the high net community production meet their iron demands, and how much mobilized iron and methane reaches illuminated depths and/or the sea-surface and outgases to the atmosphere.  <br/><br/>These goals will be accomplished with a field program off the Oregon coast that will include the following: (1) high-resolution surveys of the distributions of temperature, salinity, velocity, carbon (inorganic pCO2 and TCO2, and particulate and dissolved organic carbon), methane, and iron in the water column; (2) deliberate multiple-tracer releases in the bottom boundary layer to examine physical transport processes, illumination history, and air-sea gas exchange; (3) direct measurement using benthic flux chambers of transport between the sediments and the boundary layer; (4) measurement of reactivity of organic matter, iron and methane in the boundary layer using incubations and compound specific markers.  Data-synthesis, carbon-budgeting, and modeling efforts will integrate all the field data, incorporate reaction and transport rates, and generate predictive capabilities that can extend our results to other upwelling systems. <br/><br/>Among the broader impacts, the research will produce several technological developments that will have multi-disciplinary applications in earth science.

This theory will be used to address the rates of change and feedbacks between social perceptions and values affecting water resources and changes in surface hydrology in the Arctic.  The connection between Arctic communities (whether with and without municipal water systems) and water in their environment is much closer than the connections to water for most other communities in developed nations because Arctic communities continue to rely on water for subsistence resources, such as salmon, as well as for transportation.  This project will provide an understanding of how values and perceptions at local scales are linked to regional hydrological system dynamics as well as how culturally mediated decisions may result in cumulative effects at the regional watershed level.  The investigators will examine these linkages through the development of an integrated, systems-level, coupled modeling and text mining framework.  They will focus on Alaskan communities, addressing how values drive perceptions of water quality and quantity for water users; how rapidly changing biophysical water systems have to change before water users attempt to adapt or mitigate hydrologic change; and how changes in water values and water-use patterns lead to changes in the hydrologic system for current and future systems.

Little is known about the interactions between patterns and processes in human dominated landscapes, however.  One of the least understood aspects of urban landscape dynamics is the way in which local interactions of humans and biophysical processes generate the landscape patterns of metropolitan regions.  Studying the relationships between these interactions and the resulting urban landscape patterns is critical to plan and manage urban growth in ways that minimize the ecological impacts on ecosystems while sustaining economically and socially viable urban communities.  This research project will examine urban landscapes as emergent phenomena that result from local interactions of human agents, real estate markets, built infrastructure, and biophysical factors like land cover, geomorphology, and natural disturbance regimes to develop a theory of urban landscape dynamics.  The study will employ complex systems, patch dynamics, hierarchical theory, and an agent-based modeling approach to study coupled human-natural dynamics and empirically test this approach in two different bioregions (Seattle and Phoenix).  The models will be developed and used to test hypotheses regarding emergent properties of urban landscapes and to enhance basic understanding of humans-ecological interactions in urban landscapes across scales.  Urban landscapes exhibit some fundamental features of complex self-organizing systems.  They are highly heterogeneous, spatially nested, and hierarchically structured.  The urban spatial structure can be described as a cumulative and aggregate pattern that results from numerous local decisions involving a large number of adaptive agents interacting among themselves and with biophysical factors.  These behaviors eventually can lead to different metropolitan patterns.  This research will address four questions:  (1) How do dynamic landscape systems evolve to generate emergent patterns that are evident in urban landscapes?  (2) What nonlinearities, thresholds, discontinuities, and path dependencies explain divergent trajectories of urban landscapes?  (3) How do emergent urban landscape patterns influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning?  (4) How can planning integrate this knowledge to develop sustainable urban landscape patterns?  The model implementation will be based on a dynamic probabilistic relational model (DPRM) in which parameters and spatial rules are estimated empirically from two longitudinal land-cover and land-use data sets developed for the Seattle and Phoenix metropolitan areas.<br/><br/>The project will have significant theoretical and practical impacts.  It will develop a better understanding of complex human-ecological dynamics leading to development patterns such as sprawl, one of the most pressing and controversial problem in the United States.  The project will also contribute to advancing biocomplexity science.  The findings of this research will have an impact on both the social and natural sciences particularly the study of development patterns, land-use change, ecological resilience, and public policy in urbanizing regions.  This project will also employ new computational techniques that are of importance to a broad range of disciplines studying human dynamics, ecology, and artificial intelligence.  The findings will also aid planning and management of urban regions by providing simulation tools to assess the ecological impacts and feedback of alternative strategies for urban development and ecological conservation.

Environmental changes at local and regional scales affect human well-being and preferences as well as the decisions people make.  This project will develop an integrated model of urban development and land-cover change in the central Puget Sound region that can interface with models representing a large set of ecosystem processes.  The focus of this project will be on linking urban development to bird diversity as a test case for an integrated modeling approach.  This approach builds on model traditions in urban economics, landscape ecology, bird population dynamics, and complex system science, each of which offers different perspectives on modeling urban ecological interactions.  The project will apply Bayesian networks and a multi-agent microsimulation approach because of the potential for those approaches to support complex inference modeling in problem domains with inherent uncertainty.

Although extensive urban research has focused on the dynamics of urban systems and their ecological interactions, these diverse urban processes have yet to be synthesized into one coherent modeling framework.  Simulation models of urban and ecological dynamics have evolved in separate knowledge domains.  While both of these research areas deal with human-environmental interactions, they do so with very different emphases, scale, methodology and objectives.  This research will investigate how best to model complexity and uncertainty of coupled socioeconomic and biophysical processes in metropolitan regions and their interactions with the policy domain.  This project will emphasize the importance of explicitly representing human and ecological processes in modeling urban systems, including patterns, processes, and impacts.  Ultimately, this project will assist in identifying answers to questions related to the potential use of public policy to intervene in urban ecological systems in ways that may reduce ecological damage from urban processes while sustaining economically and socially viable urban communities for people.  The project therefore should help in the development of tools for policy makers to explore the links between human behaviors and environmental change.

Fieldwork will build upon prior intensive archaeological, ecological, and pedological research by team members, but will emphasize new, integrative work on biogeochemical variation across the study landscapes, and on acquiring additional paleo-demographic and paleobotanical data necessary to address the research themes noted above.  The varied data sets will be integrated using a geographic information systems approach, and hierarchical modeling will be used to test hypotheses regarding human-environment interactions over time.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the Hawaiian Islands because this archipelago offers unique opportunities to constrain the analysis of human-environment interactions (e.g., short time scale, isolation, pronounced biogeochemical gradients).  The issues to be addressed, however, are global.  The cultural and natural evolutionary processes to be studied--such as unprecedented population growth, widespread deforestation, soil degradation through nutrient depletion, population migrations into marginal lands, and increased political and economic centralization and control--are all taking place today on a global scale.  By studying these processes on a controlled time scale of approximately 1,000 years, this research will produce dynamic models of the causal links between such key factors, models which can help us to understand the irreversible environmental and cultural changes driven by the coupling of human and natural systems.  Such models should be of considerable relevance to on-going attempts to develop sustainable human ecosystems.  The results of this project will therefore be of wide interest to a range of disciplines, including ecology, demography, anthropology, economics, and biogeography.

Time periods with scarce water can be long-lasting, making it difficult to manage water and land use and to supply consistent goods and services to large population centers.  The primary goal of this developmental project is to develop a theoretical framework that will allow for an integration of human and biophysical Mediterranean watershed dynamics.  This requires a greater understanding of the inherent biocomplexity of Mediterranean watersheds and the dynamic relationships among these environmental systems and human actions, institutions, and policies.  A multidisciplinary team of researchers drawn from both the natural and social sciences will explore the consistency between hydrologic, biotic, and socioeconomic models that are used to explain and to regulate watershed ecosystem behavior and the realities of watershed behavior in Mediterranean environments.  Prevailing scientific models of watersheds and regulatory systems developed to manage natural resources in watersheds commonly have evolved without a thorough understanding of Mediterranean watershed dynamics.  The investigators hypothesize that these scientific models are better suited to relatively homogenous environments with fairly predictable rainfall and tight relations between stream flow and proximate land uses than they are to Mediterranean watersheds with their episodic hydrology and frequent disturbance.  The validity of this hypothesis will be tested as a basis for potentially more useful formulations of Mediterranean problems.  In doing so, the investigators will explore the influence of physical, biological, social, and institutional processes on the function and health of Mediterranean ecosystems at various spatial scales ranging stream reaches and individual watersheds to entire river systems.  They will conduct a series of facilitated workshops and field days to help critically assess the suitability of existing models for Mediterranean conditions.  These workshops and field days will help to identify shared variables among disciplines and their use in developing interdisciplinary models; design a comparative research framework to test new models and hypotheses; provide an operational watershed forum and academic advancement for the broader community; and enhance support for comparative interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>Human population growth in Mediterranean-climate regions has placed considerable pressure on scarce freshwater resources, resulting in widespread impairment of river and stream systems.  A great deal of capital is being invested in restoring Mediterranean watersheds with a very shallow conceptual awareness of where, how, and what is being restored.  This has led to many restoration project failures in California and elsewhere.  By integrating theories, perspectives, and methods from the physical, biological, and social sciences, this project will provide a sounder basis for the restoration of Mediterranean watersheds, and it will help address existing laws and institutional structures that are not well-equipped to deal with this kind of dynamic system.

Many of these impacts are positive (e.g. poverty reduction), but there are also negative effects, particularly for natural systems due to the increasing demand for natural resources of a growing and more affluent population.  Furthermore, rural inhabitants, particularly young people, are migrating to regional urban centers or to more developed economies (e.g., the United States), because they are attracted by opportunities of better jobs, education, and health services. These unprecedented changes in both demographic factors (e.g., rapid urbanization, international migration, falling rural fertility and mortality) and economic factors (e.g. expansion of non-agricultural industries, decreasing price of agricultural produce, emigrant remittances, emergence of large-scale modern agriculture, and increasing global demand for food and petroleum alternatives) are predicted to lead to the following land-use transitions: 1 ) Extensive conversion of native ecosystems to modern agriculture, particularly in areas with little topographic relief (e.g. soybean production in South American dry forest ecosystems), and 2) Abandonment of marginal agricultural and grazing lands, particularly in mountainous and remote regions, permitting ecosystem recovery.  To test these predictions, the project will combine demographic and socio-economic data from >18,000 municipalities throughout Latin America and Caribbean with remote sensing analyses of land-cover/land-use change for the period 1980-2000.  In addition, the project will document how these demographic and land-use changes are affecting natural ecosystem and local inhabitants by conducting ecosystem inventories and household interviews in selected countries.

The current framework for investigating how urban planning, policy actions, and regulatory decisions impact targeted outcomes (such as reducing energy consumption and improving air quality and human health in urban areas) is relatively crude, ignoring these complex and non-linear feedback mechanisms.  For example, strategies to mitigate air pollution generally are tested by sequentially linking separate models for meteorology, emissions, and atmospheric chemistry, bypassing human and other feedback mechanisms that act both on short and long time scales.  Furthermore, the very nature of the current modeling paradigm makes it difficult to assess potential interactions among endpoints of interest, such as questions regarding whether policy recommendations intended to improve air quality have unintended impacts on health or energy consumption.  Consequently, current approaches are severely limited in their ability to assess how population growth, technological change, global climate change, and adaptation may affect the urban environment.  The goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to develop an integrated analysis framework that can be used to evaluate human response to, and impact on, heat waves and episodes of poor air quality. This framework will link models of meteorology, air quality, energy consumption and human response, incorporating feedback mechanisms among individual modules.  The data required to develop and validate this analysis framework will include (1) survey instruments to quantify human activity response functions; (2) field measurement campaigns to spatially resolve air pollution and meteorological conditions; and (3) energy and transportation data to quantify anthropogenic waste heat release profiles.  The scientific objectives of this study will be tightly coupled with the interdisciplinary environmental science and policy education of participants across the educational spectrum (high school students, teachers, undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and faculty).  While the analytical framework developed in this project will be generally applicable to any urban area, it will be implemented for two test sites (Portland Oregon, and Houston Texas) where diverse response characteristics are likely.<br/><br/>This project will provide important insight into the nature and significance of feedback mechanisms among urban climate, air quality, and human activity systems that have been heretofore neglected or not properly accounted for and quantified.  In addition to clarifying how human activity levels respond to adverse weather conditions and to health advisories, this research will relate these changes in behavior to their subsequent impacts on urban climate and air quality.  Such a comprehensive modeling framework is necessary for evaluating the performance of both short- and long-term policy actions intended to mitigate the harmful effects of adverse weather conditions and pollutant emissions in the urban environment.  The resulting framework will be robust, allowing for updating and expansion of individual modules as well as enabling researchers to apply this modeling paradigm to other cities of interest.

Its use, distribution and management are major functions of human societies. During times of scarcity or excess, for example as a result of changes in climate, populations can select from a diverse range of possible responses and adaptive strategies.  Failure may lead to conflict and societal collapse. In addition to understanding the ways in which societies may try to adapt to excess or limited water supply, it is important to assess the particular climatic, social, political and economic conditions under which a selected strategy will succeed or fail. <br/><br/>This project seeks to identify the full range of cultural responses, including economic and political activity, resource management and engineering strategies, acquisition and conflict, demographic shifts and migration, and to identify thresholds of hydroclimatic shifts that are associated with the probability of adopting particular adaptive response.<br/><br/>Project scientists will develop quantitative models of the interaction between societies and hydroclimate variability over the last millennium for mainland Southeast Asia and the Greater Mekong Basin.  This long-term focus will be made possible by two unique data sources: long, annually resolved and drought-sensitive paleoclimate information on drought and river flow from the Greater Mekong Basin (GMB), and the long archaeological and documentary record from urban societies across Southeast Asia.  Bringing together these sources of proxy data enables the identification of significant  hydroclimatic and sociopolitical events during the last thousand years and will allow the project team to explore societal response to paleoclimate variability and change within the theoretical framework of modeling vulnerability, risk, and adaption in human systems. Two related questions will be investigated:<br/><br/>- What types and scales of drought events in Indochina are of sufficient magnitude to need a social adjustment from the affected human societies?  <br/>- What factors influence the success of specific responses or strategies to mitigate the consequences of climate variability?<br/><br/>The data collected in this study will provide a unique record spanning several centuries. This has the potential to greatly improve decision making about future management and allocation of water resources in the six countries through which the Mekong River flows, by revealing the range of natural variability and how it is associated with climate variability.  Recent significant changes in the flow of the Mekong further emphasize the need to better understand its long-term history and the processes underlying its variability.  The water level of the Mekong exceeded its highest recorded level during the most recent flooding in August 2008.  Whether such extremes are consequences of global warming or the inevitable natural swings of dry-wet periods is a question of both public and scientific importance. <br/><br/>This project directly involves undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate level research in the USA, and in the GMB.  Students from Columbia University?s internship program will gain experience in an international research initiative with applications in both the social and physical sciences.  Graduate students will work on social science and policy problems related to conflict and water.

Livestock and a species-rich assemblage of large mammalian herbivores, the most abundant of which migrate over a 12,000 square-km area each year, consume a high fraction of primary plant production.  These herbivores sustain human populations and a rich assemblage of avian and mammalian carnivores.  Moreover, humans, wild animals, and livestock are all vulnerable to a wide variety of infectious diseases.  Broad-scale heterogeneity in land use is superimposed on this dynamic landscape.  The Serengeti National Park is a classic example of a protected area and ecotourism destination, while the adjacent Ngorongoro Conservation Area permits Maasai pastoralism, game reserves, (Maswa and Ikorongo) permit-controlled off-take of trophy species, and game-controlled areas (Grumeti) that permit all human activity except agriculture.  The linkages between human and natural components of the Serengeti are so pervasive that human decision making may be the critical process governing the fate of the entire ecosystem.  Pressure is mounting as human and animal populations converge on the western border of Serengeti National Park (SNP) and Mara Reserve.  To study the coupling of natural ecosystem functioning and human decision making in the greater Serengeti, this interdisciplinary research project will use four modeling approaches:  (1) Process-rich, spatially explicit ecosystem simulation models will be developed to predict changes in plant and animal communities as well as human use of landscapes at different scales.  (2) Agent-based models will incorporate individual decision-making rules in a spatially explicit environment.  (3) Analytical models of community modules will explore interactions among five to ten key species.  (4)  Macro-ecological models will describe system patterns and processes as functions of major resource inputs, such as rainfall and soil nutrients.  These models will explore emergent dynamics of the Serengeti at various organizational scales.  A large amount of Serengeti field data will be analyzed to parameterize the models and to assess their ability to explain past dynamics and current ecosystem trends.  In addition, crucial new data on human activities and choices will be collected to understand the coupling of system dynamics between natural and human-dominated components.  This blend of different modeling approaches and data syntheses will permit a unique integration of ecological and social sciences.  The concept of ecosystem resilience/resistance will be directly related to the vulnerability of human societies.<br/><br/>The theory of complex systems proposes that emergent properties can arise from relatively simple underlying mechanisms propagated in space and time.  The vulnerability of humans and sustainability of biodiversity in the Serengeti may be driven by a few critical constraints that operate independently of individual components.  These constraints arise from fundamental laws/principles in psychology, biology, chemistry, and physics that constrain key biological processes and human decisions.  Alternatively, complex systems may be sensitive to small differences in initial conditions and show a tendency to switch between alternative states.  This sensitivity suggests that biodiversity and human welfare may be highly contingent on details such as individual behavior, the identity of the species participating, and the precise spatial arrangement of interactions among humans, plants, animals, and diseases.  The Serengeti provides a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis, because its component parts are so conspicuous and its dynamical patterns have been measured for 40 years.  Finally, emergent system properties may be contingent on just a few critical components, which would imply that the Serengeti can be understood from networks of interaction among a few key species of plants/animals and humans.  In addition to providing fundamental new knowledge, the project will provide insights and information of immediate value of managers and decision makers in the study region and many other locales.  It also will provide valuable research and training opportunities for students and post-doctoral scholars, and it will facilitate international collaborations between U.S. and African scientists.

The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management.  Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers, <br/><br/>The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change.  Coupled  computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments.  Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget. The project strengthens scientific capacity and integration by bringing together scientists from a wide range of fields including landscape architecture, ecosystem science, economics, geographic information science, and complex systems science.  The project will produce results that improve our ability to model (a) carbon cycling in the heterogeneous landscapes that humans inhabit, (b) the economic incentives inherent in our management exurban landscapes, and (c) the linkages between peoples? preferences and their behaviors and ecological landscape function.  Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings. <br/>"

The objectives of this research are to: (1) test a model of relationships between human-caused environmental transformations and the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in Vietnam; (2) examine the influence of socio-ecological and socio-psychological variables on individuals' perceptions of and responses to the risk of HPAI in traditional, transitional, and modern communes; (3) integrate the research with education and training programs at the University of Hawaii, the East-West Center, and the Hanoi University of Agriculture in Vietnam; (4) establish new collaborations among scientists from multiple disciplines and among U.S. academic institutions, industry, government, and international partners from countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Because complexity is scale sensitive the project will collect and analyze data at national, commune, and household scales. The methods to be used include field observations, face-to-face interviews, geographical information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, and statistical tools. <br/><br/>The project has significant theoretical, methodological, and practical implications. Developing basic principles and methods for understanding the complex interactions within and among natural and human systems at multiple spatial scales will help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the emergence of new and reemerging infectious diseases.

This project will apply a systems approach that features resilience as an integrative concept to bring together economic, ecological and social science perspectives to better understand infrastructure impacts.  To evaluate system resilience to infrastructure, this project will use global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to quantify the probability that a key indicator of system state will go past a critical threshold, i.e., a tipping point, indicating loss of resilience via a change in system state.  The study system for this work is the frontier of the southwestern Amazon, a highly biodiverse region in which highway paving is underway.  The project will focus on two key issues that have been debated by scholars who study infrastructure impacts: changes in land tenure and livelihoods. The research will draw from different theoretical perspectives on these issues to model specific changes in land ownership, use, and livelihoods, which in turn affect two key indicators of system state: forest cover and forest value.  Dynamic simulation models will be developed to compare model output for forest cover and forest value as they depend on different assumptions about how highway paving affects tenure and livelihoods.  Simulation models will be integrated with sensitivity analysis to assess model uncertainty in predicting changes in forest cover and forest value, and to assess system resilience to highway paving.<br/><br/>This project will strengthen collaborative ties between University of Florida and partner institutions in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, and build tri-national capacity for social-ecological research in the Amazon.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained and gain experience in collaborative, interdisciplinary and international team research.  The study region has local governments and other stakeholders with needs for greater access to scientific findings regarding infrastructure.  This project will disseminate research results using an innovative knowledge exchange model designed to reach hundreds of stakeholders.  Such outreach and dialogue will support broader public participation in environmental planning by regional governments.  The modeling approach developed in this project will also contribute to understanding for other problems such as climate change and global market shifts."

The two overarching questions are (1) how climate forcing affects surf clam populations; and (2) how the current socio-economic and regulatory aspects of the coupled system adjust to the perceived and documented effects of climate change.  Heretofore climate forcing has not been considered as a variable in the scientific models used in surf clam management.  The project will introduce the environmental aspects of climate forcing through a set of interconnected mathematical and schematic models that allow evaluation of potential outcomes that result from climate forcing. The work builds upon two models developed by this team, a genetics-based population dynamics model and a coupled circulation-larval model, which will be modified for the specifics of surf clams. Outcomes of the modeling will be available to the formal stock assessment process, which in turn informs management and industry decisions.  The fishery component of the coupled system and its responses to direct effects of climate forcing as well as management rules will be studied from social science perspectives, but integrated with the biophysical analyses. Of particular interest are ways that the changing environmental conditions change individual and collective behavior in the fishery and that behavior of industry and managerial actors feeds back into the biological system. A spatial choice analysis will model industry responses to changes in clam distribution and abundance. Experimental economics will be used to assess what factors are important to achieving collective action in response to changes in the fishery.  Ethnographic techniques will be used to explore the roles of knowledge?particularly scientific and lay models, including the scenarios generated in this project?and social and economic relationships in private and collective decisions about responding to the effects of climate change in the fishery.  <br/><br/>b) Significance and importance: <br/><br/>Marine fisheries are influenced by relationships among climate, oceanographic conditions, biology, fishing industries, and social, economic, and political institutions. This project responds to the need for greater understanding of these complexities in order to redress the cumulative problems related to overfishing, climate change, and environmental stressors.  The issues are interdisciplinary in nature; collaborative research on interaction among these components is therefore critical to the larger goal of developing governance institutions that are informed by the best available science. <br/><br/>Of specific interest are the effects of climate change on a marine fishery and how those effects are perceived, interpreted, and responded to by scientists and by actors in the public and private sectors. Those human responses then modify the future outcomes in the fishery. The fishery of interest for this study, the surf clam (Spisula solidissima) fishery of the Mid-Atlantic Bight, has suffered a population decline that appears to be a result of climate warming. The study will develop a comprehensive mechanistic description of response to climate change by a dominant member of a biological community, the surf clam. The dominant member of a biological community is the cornerstone of that community as it evolves over geological time, and such cornerstone species are seminal to community stability and long-term resource availability. The study focuses on a particular fishery to develop a new paradigm that can be utilized in a broad arena from terrestrial to freshwater and marine systems.<br/> <br/>A mechanistic description of change in the species due to climate change will be coupled with the models of the human system.  The human system will incorporate the social, economic, and political factors that drive the decisions in the fishing industry and regulatory agency. Using this approach we will characterize how the coupled system evolves and explore management options. For example how does increased uncertainty from climate change modify the incentives of market-based regulations? How are the outcomes changed when there is spatial differentiation of the population that is exaggerated by climate change? Is the sustainability of the species different when the fishing industry has a strong presence in decision-making? The project will enhance the ability of private and public sector groups to effectively respond to the increasing effects of climate-induced changes.<br/> <br/>The use of state-of-the-art oceanographic and ecological modeling approaches that are linked to economic and social approaches provides opportunities to train students in a variety of disciplines. The proposed work presents a unique opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral investigators to be trained in the variety of approaches that are needed to solve many of the important problems affecting marine systems. The educational component is integrated with the research and builds on an existing K-12 educational program and outreach with specialized communities such as the commercial fishery."

A multidisciplinary team of investigators will seek answers to two main questions:  (1) How do variations in partnerships among country governments, logging companies, and third parties (NGOs, donors, local actors) affect the content of concession agreements, and practices and environmental outcomes related to logging concessions?  (2) How do armed conflict, shifts in trade and currency values, and increased monitoring of and information on logging practices, forest-cover change, and associated outcomes modify the micro- and macro-level impacts of new and evolving governance arrangements?  In answering these questions, the researchers will focus on disentangling the many intertwined and multi-level causal processes that shape forest cover and forest change.  These include macroeconomic changes, armed conflict, extra-legal activities, and behaviors of actors such as government agencies, logging companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and local users.  To identify and understand the complex, nonlinear processes through which micro-level choices of hundreds of actors shape aggregate outcomes, the investigators will deploy mathematical, statistical, and agent-based modeling techniques.  They anticipate that their research and educational activities will lead to a series of workshops, including a capstone final workshop on governance and logging, several scientific papers on the relationship between governance, logging and forest cover, two synthesis volumes on """"Logging in the Congo Basin"""" and """"Environmental Governance and Agent Based Models,"""" and the training of nearly 20 graduate students in advanced quantitative methods and modeling techniques.<br/><br/>The research project is significant because it will explain how changes in forms of governance affect logging and forest cover outcomes in a world region that is extremely important in relation to biodiversity conservation, tropical forest cover, and carbon sequestration, but which has remained quite understudied.  The research will contribute to future scientific advancement in three ways.  It will assemble and make publicly available a consolidated data repository on logging concessions in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo.  This data repository will help other researchers investigate how governance arrangements, the characteristics of logging concessions and concessionaires, local and international NGOs, and new forms of financing through civil society partnerships influence forest cover and change.  The project will build partnerships across conventional divisions among academic researchers, NGO professional, and government officials to facilitate the adoption of useful findings in policy contexts, donor funding strategies, and changing governance arrangements.  It will thereby create a broader public audience and use for scientific findings.  Finally, the project will support the training of more than twenty U.S. and African students to conduct field research, analyze data, and deploy advanced computational and modeling techniques and thereby build greater capacity for scientific research in the Congo Basin.

This degradation is projected to worsen with continued climate change, as more intense rains transport more nutrients and sediments downstream with impacts that include reduced water clarity, increases in harmful algal blooms, and a loss of high-valued fish stocks.  To address these problems, many agricultural management practices have been identified that can reduce sediment and nutrient runoff.  Effective design of policies to encourage adoption of effective agricultural management practices is limited by an important knowledge gap concerning human behavioral responses to ecosystem conditions, however.  This interdisciplinary research project will use the Maumee River watershed and western Lake Erie as a model ecosystem to quantify the co-evolution between upstream human behavior and downstream ecosystem services.  The investigators will model how public attitudes co-evolve with downstream ecosystem conditions and shape support for policies that impact agricultural management practices, and in turn, how farmers respond to these policies and public attitudes.  They also will integrate biophysical models of the study region with behavioral models of public policy and farmer decision making to predict the co-evolution among public policies, farmer behavior, and downstream ecosystems under possible future scenarios.  This modeling of the two-way coupling between upstream human behavior and downstream ecosystem services will address the question of whether changes in upstream public attitudes, policies, and farmer behavior will offset anticipated negative impacts of climate change on downstream ecosystem services.<br/><br/>This project will develop a coupled human-natural system model that focuses on the dynamic feedback between upstream human behavioral responses and downstream ecosystem change.  It will provide an assessment of how farmer behavioral responses mediate the interactions between specific policies and changing ecological conditions, and it will enhance understanding regarding the capacity of state and local policy makers to influence farmer behavior and downstream ecosystem conditions in ways that may counteract the expected negative impacts of climate change.  While substantial research has focused on the one-way impacts of upstream nutrient inputs and fluxes on watershed functioning and downstream ecosystem services, key reverse linkages that shape public, policy, and farmer responses to ecological changes have received much less attention.  The integrated model will provide the theoretical foundation for assessing the dynamic linkages between human attitudes and behaviors and downstream ecological conditions and will improve predictions of the dynamic effect of changing behavioral activities and climate on the availability and quality of downstream ecosystem services.  This predictive knowledge is relevant to societal concerns because it will improve the ability of decision makers in coastal watersheds to manage adaptively to address negative impacts of climate change.  The project also will provide education, training, and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  The investigators will work  directly with Grade 6-12 teachers within rural school districts in the Maumee watershed to develop watershed science curriculum, and they will disseminate results more broadly by working with the Ohio Sea Grant College Program to develop and distribute materials targeted at decision makers and the general public.

Explanations for declines in many species, particularly in relation to several species of salmon, have been monocausal and political without detailed investigations of the relationships between predators (humans and sea mammals) and their prey in this region.  Using biological and ecological data, paleoclimatic reconstructions, archaeological data on subsistence and harvesting rates, historic and modern catch and escapement records, ethnographic reports and traditional ecological knowledge, this project will use Swarm agent-based modeling routines to investigate the dynamics of human-salmon-ecosystem interactions in the southern Bering Sea region of Alaska.  The multidisciplinary investigative team will develop methods to directly test a number of relationships associated with direct and indirect impacts of changes in one or more sets of human and/or natural systems on the others.

Recent dramatic decreases in the numbers of many species in this region have perplexed biologists, caused sweeping and underinformed management decisions, and provoked cultural disintegration of many Alaska Native villages.  Date gathered during the 20th century show that there have been other periods of low productivity for species, often followed by periods of abundance.  These patterns also are evident in paleoecological and archaeological data from the last 5,000 years, thereby emphasizing the critical character of a central question:  Given varying population cycles of humans, salmon, groundfish, sea mammals, birds, and many other species in the North Pacific region as well as varying harvests by the higher trophic levels, how do people sustain populations, ecosystems, and the peoples and cultures who depend on them for social, political, economic, and cultural identity?  To investigate the complex interactions among natural and human systems on and around Sanak Island in the Aleutian chain of Alaska, an interdisciplinary research team will study humans as part of the northern ecosystem.  The investigators will examine interrelationships among the modern and prehistoric, terrestrial and marine, and local and regional systems, including both empirical and theoretical explorations.  In previous projects, the investigators have observed that the indigenous Aleut were not just simple and passive harvesters but were active participants in a regional ecosystem that includes them as significant forces.  The implications of this approach require the integration of anthropology, archaeology, geology, ecology, mathematics, climatology, and history, the perspective of many spatial and temporal scales, and the seamless merging of theoretical approaches from many fields.  Because the Aleut have been harvesting resources on the north Pacific for thousands of years, they have been included in models and reconstructions of the island's ecosystem as ecosystem engineers, as more ordinary components of food webs and landscapes, and as passive responders to a world that is primarily driven by largely external forces like climate and geomorphic evolution.<br/><br/>This project will result in development and application of modern analytical techniques drawn from the study of complex systems in order to better understand the roles of peoples in the history and functioning of the Earth.  The investigators are constructing and analyzing the first extensive food webs that extend over millennial time scales.  The project is distinctive because of its extensive explicit inclusion of people as components of food webs.  The investigators are pioneering the development of techniques for extracting information from data in which error is necessarily confounded with time period, and the project will yield data that can be compared across times.  The investigators are extensively developing and testing methods for interfacing data from diverse sources that inherently differ in resolution and data structure (e.g., ancient middens, climate reconstruction by proxy and modeling, various direct censuses), and they are expanding the application of stable isotopes to study ecological and paleoecological phenomena that emphasize large-scale ecosystem structure and function.  The investigators also will bring new perspectives to the relationships of diversity and productivity of ecosystems, comparing systems across very long time scales , and they will advance understanding of sustainable patterns of food web and ecosystem structures and dynamics.  The project will incorporate indigenous knowledge, local history, and direct community participation in data collection, and it will give residents a voice in the process of scientific advisement through both collaboration and through the analysis of marine policy that directly affects their daily lives.  The project will provide critical scientific data to inform policy regarding long-term data on the role of humans in the dynamics of North Pacific ecosystems, and it will illuminate the state of historical shifting baselines in the ecosystem over deep time.  The investigators are exploring a new way of doing scientific research in this kind of setting by incorporating local people as part of a complex ecosystem rather than an external impact to be externally regulated.

The project's first aim is to develop, calibrate, and validate a cellular automaton (CA) model representing land use and land cover change over the past half century in Nang Rong.  CA models provide a formal framework for investigating the behavior of complex, extended systems.  The CA model to be developed in this project focuses on the spatial and temporal dynamics of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and plant succession.  Rules for the CA modeling will be derived from formal theories of growth and change, and models will incorporate the results of empirical analyses.  The second aim of the project is to use the CA model in dynamic simulations to explore land-use and land-cover change as both cause and consequence of patterns of village settlement in a frontier environment; road development and increases in vehicular traffic; migration and household formation as the frontier closes; land tenure; monsoonal variability; agricultural intensification; cooperative use of the hydrological layer; major shifts in world markets; electrification; the rise in television ownership; and the spread of consumerism.  Results of the simulations will be used to examine the spatial distribution as well as composition of land-use and land-cover change, and they will be used to evaluate trajectories for a sample of pixels and other spatial units.  The project's third aim is to package the simulations into a multimedia GIS database.  This database, together with other materials explaining the situation, will be adapted to and tested for use at the secondary and college levels and then made publicly available via the Internet.<br/><br/>Through the conduct of this project, the challengers of understanding the role of human behavior in land-use and land-cover change will be met through the development, elaboration, and evaluation of the cellular automaton (CA) modeling described above for the Nang Rong district.  The temporal depth, areal extent, and grain size of the social surveys, remote images, and GIS data afford a unique capability to examine complex systems operating within a complexity theory context.  The coupling of the simulation power of CA modeling, with its ability to allow for nonlinearities and feedbacks, and a rich set of empirically derived relationships will provide valuable new insights into the complex interactions among natural and human systems.  The project also will facilitate collaborations between U.S. scientists and scientists at Mahidol University in Thailand.  This project is an award emanating from the FY 2001 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.<br/>"

This knowledge is critical for predicting where and when second- and third-generation forests might emerge and for understanding the conditions necessary to maintain them.  Furthermore, such knowledge is urgently required to inform global climate models, climate change mitigation scenarios, and a suite of other environmental issues.  This interdisciplinary research project will focus on the human and ecological linkages that give rise to specific forest forms (including forest extent, species composition, and land-cover patterns) and functions (including benefits of the forest like timber, recreation, privacy, and wildlife habitat).  The investigators will examine the extent to which those linkages and the forests emergent from them lead to irreversible changes in socioecological systems.  They will focus their attention on Appalachian Ohio, an area whose which forests have returned and where there is sufficient time depth to examine the underlying socioecological processes that give rise to them.  A former extractive periphery devastated in the 19th and early 20th centuries, its extensive forests have emerged in surprising ways over the last century.  Project goals are (1) to compare forest composition between pre-settlement forests and contemporary forests; (2) to describe the social and ecological form and function of recovered forests; (3) to explain the emergence of the forest over time; and (4) to predict how these socioecological systems will function in the future.  The methods to be used include an agent-based model representing land-use decision-making and implementation coupled with the landscape disturbance and succession model, which simulates forest succession and regrowth.  To inform the models with empirical data, the researchers will collect field data on forest structure and composition, generate time-series classifications of remotely sensed images, and investigate political, economic, infrastructural, and cultural dynamics using archival and field-derived data.<br/><br/>This project will make important contributions to theory and methods for understanding dynamically coupled socioecological systems.  The project will advance basic understanding of forest transitions by focusing on forest resilience, thus treating forest recovery as an emergent property of complex socioecological systems.  The project will focus attention on differences in ecosystem attributes before and long after massive disturbance, showing that humans and ecosystems have together created unexpected ecologies.  The project will demonstrate specific ways that forest form and function respond to local forces and distant shocks that are both social and ecological.  Methodologically, the project will advance agent-based modeling science by using innovative metrics to incorporate social inequality and power dynamics and by coupling social simulation with landscape-level forest growth models.  As a collaborative project between two Ohio-based universities and the U.S. Forest Service, the project will provide practical information regarding pressing social and environmental issues in Appalachian Ohio, including rural poverty, ecological change, and management of public and private forests.  Global applications of this portable framework include enhancing the ways that scholars and policy makers understand, plan for, and help to foster ecological recovery, in particular by drawing attention to the role of social inequalities in shaping socioecological resilience.  The findings of this research can also inform climate modeling and mitigation.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program."

With few exceptions, fisheries currently are managed independently, ignoring important natural and human linkages among them.  The biological productivity, sustainability, and consequently human benefits of complex fishery systems may be substantially increased if these linkages are better understood and if this understanding is applied to management.  The American lobster (Homarus americanus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Northeast multispecies groundfish fisheries in the Gulf of Maine are of major ecological, economic, social, and cultural importance to the New England region.  They are subject to an array of natural and human linkages that have not yet been systematically studied.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine key natural and human linkages among these fisheries and integrate them into a quantitative framework, using numerical modeling to explore how improved understanding of complexity can improve sustainability and increase the flow of human benefits.  An important component of the research is the translation of concepts and results into an educational program that will teach a new generation of students about the human and natural complexity of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem and create a sustained interest in marine science.  The research is organized by themes.  Theme 1 focuses on management of the coupled fishery system. Numerical models will be used to integrate research undertaken in themes 2,3, and 4 and to explore how information regarding interrelated natural and human processes can be used to improve management of these resources.  Theme 2 will use econometric estimation and bioeconomic modeling to investigate the human connections between these fisheries that arise through movement of labor and capital between fisheries, regulatory interventions and markets for inputs and outputs, such as herring used as an input to lobster harvest.  Theme 3 will synthesize and analyze existing data to characterize variability in transport and survival of early life stages to identify exogenous processes (especially climate-related processes) that drive variability in recruitment.  Theme 4 will combine new field studies with analysis of existing data to examine the impact of natural and human-induced trophic interactions among lobster, herring, and groundfish on the population dynamics of these species.  Theme 5 will focus on translating research findings into an interactive marine science education program, based at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, which serves fifth and sixth graders throughout the state of Maine.<br/><br/>The project will make important contributions to science by improving basic understanding of the dynamic interrelationships of physical, ecological, and human-economic processes that determine the productivity and variability of the Gulf of Maine lobster, herring, and groundfish fisheries.  It also will help develop concepts, research methodologies, and models relevant to fishery systems around the world.  There is general agreement on the need to take an ecosystem approach to managing fisheries, but little concrete progress has been made in doing so.  This project will develop concepts and methodologies needed to implement an ecosystem approach to fishery management.  The project brings together a team of researchers from a broad range of disciplines and will demonstrate the benefits of an integrated interdisciplinary approach to investigating natural-human systems.  The research will develop new understanding and approaches for management of important Northeast U.S. fisheries.  The new information and insights will be conveyed to fishery managers through seminars, participation in the management process, and publications.  The research will be coordinated with an ongoing, interactive marine education activity.  A broader goal of that education program is to increase the number of students pursuing education and informed careers in the sciences by generating interest and excitement about science at a critical age.  The project also will provide training for graduate students and undergraduate assistants in quantitative, multidisciplinary approaches to the study and management of coupled natural-human systems.

These informal arrangements and incentives are important because they help us understand the extent to which private interests might strengthen or weaken on-going resource management and, consequently, the sustainability of coupled human and natural systems. The broad hypothesis driving the study is that the informal social structure that emerges from competitive interactions among fishermen reflects the particular circumstances of the natural system. In some cases, successful competition requires secretive non-cooperative behavior; in others, cooperation tends to yield better competitive results. These different outcomes have different, and not always obvious, impacts on the feasibility and effectiveness of resource management. <br/><br/>We think of the relevant human social process as one in which individuals compete with one another through time-consuming and costly acquisition of valuable knowledge about a complex resource. To compete successfully, individuals must balance the immediate benefits that come from exploiting knowledge they currently hold with the costly need to explore for new knowledge; additionally, when seeking new knowledge, individuals must balance the costs and benefits of acquiring knowledge through cooperation or through autonomous search. In order to model this kind of competitive process, we employ a significantly modified version of a technique borrowed from computer science called a learning classifier system (LCS). LCS uses a genetic algorithm to mimic the way an agent (here a fisherman) uses his experience to continuously refine his knowledge and decisions about his natural and social environment.  The importance of LCS is that it permits simulation of the co-evolving strategic interactions of self-interested fishermen who are only partially informed about the state of the resource they are exploiting and the fishermen with whom they compete. <br/><br/>The problem of understanding these kinds of competitive dynamics is evident in almost all coupled natural and human systems. We apply the approach to a comparative study of three Gulf of Maine fisheries which are characterized by significantly different temporal and spatial dynamics - sea urchins, lobster and cod.  Each fishery will be modeled using a biophysical simulator of the natural system and a tightly integrated multi-agent learning classifier system that simulates the learning and interactions of fishermen. The design of each model will be based in part on extensive interviews with fishermen about their knowledge of the dynamics of the fisheries in which they work. We will use these models to explore past and prospective policy problems in each fishery. <br/><br/>Beyond the immediate applicability of these explorations, we expect this project will provide a foundation for the wider use of multi-agent learning models in other coupled systems. Project outcomes will be transmitted regularly to industry and managers. <br/><br/>Principal investigators include economists, biologists, anthropologists and computer scientists. All the PIs have years of experience in the fisheries of the Gulf of Maine and have well developed relationships with individual fishermen and managers. A masters level student in marine policy, a Ph.D. student in computer or marine science and a post-doctoral researcher in computer science will be employed on the project. In addition, the project will develop an undergraduate course in complex adaptive social-ecological systems and a graduate student/faculty workshop in the same area."

In the Cordillera Blanca, the most glacierized mountain range in the tropics, the natural and social systems of the region are very dependent on glacial water resources and it is considered to be one of the most vulnerable to glacier-related water stress in the world.  This interdisciplinary and collaborative research project will evaluate the new system of freshwater governance that is emerging in the Andes and how glacial dynamics are transforming melt water rates as they rapidly recede.  The research will generate new insights into the coupled natural and human consequences of glacial recession in the tropical highlands by examining the combined effects of glacier recession on downstream watersheds, the resilience of livelihood systems and the ways in which economic change and shifting water governance are factors in this hydrologic, ecological, and social transformation. The research will also generate new hydrologic models and derive quantitative estimates of glacial water dynamics. <br/><br/>As glacier recession is accelerating in the Cordillera Blanca, dramatic changes in the Andean hydrologic regime pose significant challenges to Andean society.

Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) are among the most significant of these human influences.  Many studies demonstrate the influence of LULCC on local and regional climate, which, when aggregated, may significantly alter the global climate.  Meanwhile, climate change related to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases is expected to considerably affect people and ecosystems due to altered temperature and precipitation patterns.  While significant research has focused on global climate modeling and socioeconomic factors influencing land-use change, an integrated assessment at the regional scale of coupled human-climatic systems is required to address the question, What is the magnitude and nature of the interaction between land use and climate change at regional and local scales?  Through this research project, an international multidisciplinary team including social, ecological, atmospheric, and statistical scientists will address this question by exploring the linkages between two foci of global change research, LULCC and climate change.  A major goal of global change science is to obtain a more reliable estimation of future climatic conditions.  This goal increasingly requires high-resolution regional scale climate modeling that includes feedbacks between the land and atmosphere.  This project aims to complete the loop of land-use/climate/land-use impacts assessment.  Its contribution is in analysis of the complex linkages among components, with special emphasis on the questions, how does land-use change affect climate and how will climate change affect land use?  These linkages will be examined through analysis and modeling of agricultural systems, land-use change, the physical properties of land cover, and regional climate dynamics.  The study will focus on East Africa, which has broad ranges of ecosystems, tropical climatic conditions, and areas of rapid land use change as well as a population vulnerable to climatic variability.  The project will integrate (1) future local-level climate scenarios derived from downscaling of global climate models; (2) information derived from detailed long-term case studies of LULCC and analyses of long records of observed climate; (3) models to project LULCC from local to regional scales; (4) analyses of time-series satellite imagery to translate the effects of LULCC on land surface characteristics; (5) net primary productivity simulations; and (6) climate information from a regional climate model parameterized using local land surface parameters.  The culmination of the project will be a series of climate-land system feedback experiments identifying the magnitude and nature of interactions between land and climate dynamics at regional scales.  The investigators will characterize these interactions in terms of the determining form of feedbacks, the strength of linkages, issues of spatial and temporal scales, and the effect of """"tipping points"""" on climate-land interactions.<br/><br/>The project will make a significant contribution both to science and to policy.  Its scientific importance lies in addressing the complex interactions and feedback between climate change and land-use change by integrating state-of-the-art methodologies and multidisciplinary approaches.  It will explicitly address issues important to biocomplexity theory and complex system modeling, including feedback, thresholds, uncertainty, and non-linearity.   These are inherent issues in linking information derived from a variety of models and case studies in order to understand the multi-scale dynamics associated with linking LULCC and climate change over time.  The anticipated scientific findings and new methodologies will advance future climate change research at regional and global scales.  With respect to application, the project will provide plausible scenarios of future climate change and its impacts upon the dominant livelihood systems of East Africa.  The team will work with policy-makers and other stakeholders, including farmers and herders, to assess the implications of these scenarios for future agricultural research and policy, conservation, and land-use planning in the region.  The findings will be relevant to scientists and policy-makers in many other parts of the world who are concerned with the implications for society and environment of complex interactions between land use and climate.  In addition to addressing many fundamental climatic, ecological and socioeconomic questions, the research will be tightly integrated with the education of students from elementary school to graduate school.  It will provide capacity-building opportunities for young and mid-career American and African scientists as well as outreach to various stakeholders from local to international communities.

While our understanding of biophysical cross-boundary processes, such as nutrient flows and invasions of exotic species, has improved markedly over the past decade, work on social processes is urgently needed. Two increasingly important cross-boundary social processes impacting nature reserves around the world are rural-urban labor migration (migration of residents from rural areas for urban employment opportunities) and ecotourism (nature-based tourism in rural areas often by city dwellers). These phenomena are especially critical and rapidly evolving in developing countries such as China, which are experiencing unprecedented increases in human mobility due to economic development over the past three decades. However, little is known about the interactive effects of migration and ecotourism on human-nature dynamics. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the effects of these interacting processes on the coupled human-natural system (forests/panda habitat and local residents) in the Wolong Nature Reserve, the flagship reserve for conservation of the world-famous endangered Giant Pandas of China. The project will take a systems approach to address four interrelated objectives: (1) evaluate the effects of ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system; (2) assess the effects of labor migration on the coupled human-natural system; (3) understand the interactive effects of labor migration and ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system, and (4) model and simulate the long-term effects of migration and ecotourism on the coupled human-natural system. The methods to be used in this study include field observations, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders, geographic information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, and systems modeling and simulation.  The project will tightly integrate research with both formal education from K-12 to graduate school, and with engagement of stakeholders and the general public from local to international levels.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the theoretical understanding of complex human-natural system dynamics, concentrating on crucial characteristics such as nonlinearity, thresholds, feedbacks, and uncertainty that are shaped by cross-boundary processes. The project will also make methodological contributions by advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling in producing a web-accessible model exploring the complexity of cross-boundary processes. With respect to the application of research results, the project will contribute to improved policy for the conservation of panda habitat in Wolong, providing insight for designing policies that balance the needs of panda conservation and economic development in the world''s most populous nation. The findings will also be of general interest to many other systems due to escalating cross-boundary processes around the world and the urgent need to develop effective policies for addressing increasingly complex human-nature dynamics."

China's upper Yangtze basin is an excellent site for LUCC research.  Induced by high population density, rapid economic growth, and historical resource exploitation, regional land uses and land covers have witnessed tremendous change, including depletion of primary forests, degradation of grassland, and farming on steep slopes.  These disturbances have resulted in worsening soil erosion, elevated levels of greenhouse-gas emissions, and severe damage to the rich web of life.  While recent efforts have been made at ecological rehabilitation, the outlook of the regional environment is far from certain or optimistic.

Project objectives are (1) to measure the attributes and dynamics of LUCC in the upper Yangtze basin; (2) to explore sampling and modeling strategies to determine the factors influencing land-use and land-cover change and make future projections; and (3) to develop and validate datasets and approaches for assessing the environmental impacts.  To accomplish these objectives, project investigators will (1) integrate the natural and human processes at multiple scales; (2) build spatial, physical, and socioeconomic datasets from various sources; (3) identify specific ways for obtaining additional socioeconomic and ecological data, verifying the data quality through surveying and ground truthing; (4) develop case studies to profile regional land-use and land-cover change, with a focus on technological and institutional changes; and (5) search for appropriate procedures to incorporate technological and institutional changes as well as system feedbacks into the LUCC models.<br/><br/>The project is expected to advance basic knowledge of the forces that produce regional land-use and land-cover change and environmental impacts of that change.

It also will aid China in fulfilling its commitments to restoring its ecosystems, which is in line with its Forestry Action Plan for Agenda 21, Blueprint for Ecosystem Development, and other international obligations.  China's experience will benefit those countries that face environmental challenges while undergoing economic transition and other nations that have been contemplating how to combat the worsening resource and environmental conditions while reducing poverty.  Moreover, enhanced knowledge about land-use and land-cover changes in China is relevant to such international initiatives as the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Desertification Combating, and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Remote communities, those that lie at the periphery of existing global market, migration, and technology networks, are increasingly connecting to these networks through infrastructure projects such as roads, rail, ports, and communication technologies.  Because remote communities often are found in close proximity to abundant and relatively intact natural resources, an understanding how the forces of globalization interact with tightly coupled human and natural systems in remote communities is central to achieving environmental sustainability.  Causal pathways linking global connection to environmental effects are complex and often are mediated by myriad factors, including household economics; human, social, and physical capital assets of households and communities; local governance and knowledge; formal and informal institutions; culture; and gender dynamics. Previous studies have provided limited and often contradictory accounts of these pathways and effects due to their narrow scope, limited time frames, and research design.  This interdisciplinary research project will address these concerns and provide answers to the overall question:  What are the impacts on human and natural systems of the connection of remote communities to global networks of markets, migration, and technology?  The project's objectives are to determine the effects of market, migration, and technology integration in remote communities on local agricultural, forest, and marine resources while identifying and accounting for possible mediating factors.  The research sites are twelve small communities along the heretofore isolated Caribbean """"Mosquito"""" Coast of Nicaragua.  The communities vary in their degree of connectedness to urban centers and therefore to global networks via new infrastructure.  The investigators will employ a variety of data collection strategie, including (1) household surveys; (2) key informant interviews with community leaders and local government officials; (3) assessments of agricultural, forestry, and marine ecosystems; (4) satellite imagery of land use change; and (5) market surveys for the agricultural, forestry, and marine sectors.  Their analytical methods will include land-cover change analysis, empirical modeling and statistical analyses, and agent-based modeling.<br/><br/>This study will test and extend theories of the influence of external forces of globalization on human and natural systems in remote communities.  As the reach of these forces continues to extend, understanding their impact and developing strategies for mitigating their harmful effects is of the utmost environmental, economic, and social importance.  Project results will help policy makers and leaders of understudied remote communities better anticipate and plan for changes coming from global connection, and they will help guide resource use and management.  By incorporating the exogenous factors of markets, migration, and technology along with various household characteristics, the project's analytical approach for examining environmental impacts will provide a language for scholars from a wide range of disciplines to interact on a broad basis for collaboration on similar problems associated the impacts of globalization on remote communities.  The project also will have educational impact by engaging students of all levels, at home and abroad, in the discussion and analysis of the project's research themes.

CHANS research recently has emerged as an exciting and integrative field of cross-disciplinary scientific inquiry, with research projects covering a variety of coupled systems in locations spanning the globe.  Until now, however, this type of research has largely been undertaken in the traditional mode of individual projects, each focused on one or a small number of sites.  Although these individual projects have generated many important insights, it is essential to systematically transform the field to be more than the sum of its parts and to provide broader insights of greater scientific and societal significance than those resulting from individual projects alone.  This project aims to foster that transformation by developing an international network of research on CHANS (CHANS-Net) to facilitate communication and collaboration among members of the CHANS research community (e.g., ecologists, social scientists, geoscientists, and engineers).  CHANS-Net has four interrelated objectives:  (1) To promote communication and collaboration across the CHANS community through virtual interaction; (2) To facilitate communication and collaboration through face-to-face interaction; (3) To generate and disseminate comparative and synthesis scholarship on CHANS complexity; and (4) To strengthen, broaden and diversify the CHANS community.  These objectives will be achieved through a series of activities, including the creation of a state-of-the-art web-based Virtual Resource Center to offer timely exchange and dissemination of important information, the organization of symposia and workshops to compare and synthesize the latest research findings and methods on CHANS complexity across various research sites, the publication of first-rate comparative and synthesis results on CHANS complexity, and the establishment of a CHANS Fellows program to enable the participation of students and junior researchers in CHANS-Net activities, with particular efforts to encourage the participation from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The project will advance discovery and understanding of CHANS complexity by enhancing communication and collaboration across the CHANS community.  It will elevate CHANS science to a higher level of synthesis by taking advantage of the knowledge and strengths of the site-based CHANS research.  It will offer useful information for researchers in various fields and other people from around the world who are interested in CHANS.  It will further stimulate interest in CHANS research and increase the number and the effectiveness of scholars pursuing CHANS research.  In addition to the production of scholarly synthesis, this project will yield many other very important products, such as the identification of research gaps and priorities, improvement in methods for rigorous comparative analyses across site-based CHANS studies, training of a new generation of leaders in CHANS research, and building of professional relationships that will lead to longer, deeper, and broader collaboration in the future.

The large majority of climate change assessments have focused on how a local/regional process or system may be affected by a perturbed climate.  These traditional assessments usually have not explicitly considered the evolution over time of individual system components, such as climate, other biophysical factors, economic impacts, individual decision-making, and policy formulation.  Few assessments have examined temporal changes in the interactions among these components, and traditional assessments typically have not incorporated geographic differences in potential impacts and the interactions among geographic regions.  International market systems are characterized by multiple production regions distributed worldwide that are likely to be differentially impacted by climate change.  Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the linkages among production regions via international trade needs to be realistically considered along with geographic differences in adaptation strategies and policies.  Given these demanding requirements, few industry-wide assessments have been attempted that emphasize the need for enhanced methods for evaluating the potential impacts of climate change on international industries.  This international collaborative research project will develop and evaluate an integrated framework for climate change assessments for international market systems that simultaneously and explicitly considers spatial and temporal dynamics of natural and human systems at multiple scales from the local to the global and from the individual to an industry.  The investigators will pay special emphasis to industries with long-term investments, with much of their attention given to studies of the tart cherry industry in the central U.S. and central Europe.  They will combine dynamic modeling of temporally evolving system components with static modeling for those components where dynamic modeling is not feasible.  A chain of linked models will assess the potential impact of a changing climate on a market system for each of a series of future time slices; succeeding time slices will be connected by projections in adaptation options, economic factors such as consumer preferences, and regional development patterns.  The model chain will include a hybrid approach to the downscaling of future climate projections, a production model, an individual-level decision-making model, and an international trade model.  Numerous technical and implementation challenges will be investigated and addressed using an example industry involving a specialized perennial agricultural commodity as proof of concept.  In addition to the technical advances made possible by the proposed framework, this research will contribute to the development and growth of a diverse pool of undergraduate and graduate students with expertise in international, interdisciplinary research and will provide informal education to the general public on potential impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>This project will advance basic understanding of the potential impacts of climate variability and change on dynamic, interactive worldwide activities and systems.  It will enhance methodologies for the assessment of climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, it will improve the characterizations of past, current, and future climates, and it will incorporate individual decision making and adaptation into assessment processes.  It also will provide a novel approach for evaluating the overall uncertainty, or """"meta-uncertainty,"""" of assessment outcomes.  More broadly, the framework developed by the project can potentially be transformative in terms of how climate change assessments are conducted, and it could help shape international environmental policy formulation to take into account the spatial interactions of worldwide activities.

Is it possible to separate out the impact of climate change from human impacts on the ecological system when they are interacting with each other?  This question is being examined in the savannas of East Africa, where vegetation and society are expected to be particularly impacted by climate change.  These areas are dominated by pastoralism and, in some areas, by wildlife.  They are at the expanding edge of cropped agriculture.  Climate change is leading to warmer temperatures, to altered precipitation patterns, and to significant losses of productivity in some places.  These shifts and more frequent extreme rainfall events will profoundly affect the ecosystem and the livelihood systems dependent on livestock and natural resources.  Human responses include altered livestock and cropping land-use systems, but at some point, natural resource-based livelihoods may simply not able to satisfy the needs of households, thereby leading to a tipping point of change.  This interdisciplinary research project will conduct an analysis of the interactions among climate, human activity and land use through a case study of change in three different savannah-based regions in the east African nations of Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.  The investigators will explore these relationships from a number of perspectives, including political ecology, landscape ecology, and resilience theory.  Multiple methods and information sources will be used to identify processes and their impacts on the integrated system.  At the regional level, the investigators will incorporate climate and vegetation modeling and analyses of satellite imagery in their work, while at the case-study level, they will include surveys, household decision modeling, plant species counts, and forage analysis.<br/><br/>This project will provide new information about the impact of climate change on savanna ecosystems and will contribute to answering questions on the relative importance of land use affecting climate.

The approach and analyses will inform research in similar ecosystems around the globe.  They will add to scientific knowledge on interactions and feedbacks among climate, land, and society and on complex system modeling.  The results will contribute to society's awareness of the impact of climate change and will inform options for adaptation and mitigation.

Many studies have found that government policies can significantly shape human activities, but most of those studies have focused on a single policy at a time and ignored the interactive effects among various policies.  Little is known about the complex interactions among the effects of multiple policies on the spatial-temporal dynamics of biodiversity such as wildlife habitat.  Studying the interrelationships of various policies for biodiversity conservation is critical and urgent because multiple policies often are implemented simultaneously.  These policies may be nonlinearly complementary or counterproductive.  An excellent site for studying such interactions is Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province in southwestern China.  The reserve, which is 200,000 hectares in size, is one of the largest homes to world-famous endangered giant pandas and several thousand other animal and plant species.  There are also more than 4,000 local residents and a variety of human activities in the reserve, such as farming and fuelwood collection.  Since the establishment of the reserve in 1975, human population size has increased by more than 70 percent.  This rapidly increasing human population plays a novel and unique role in degrading the pandas' habitat.  To prevent further degradation of panda habitat and promote habitat restoration, the Chinese government is implementing three conservation policies in the reserve:  an eco-hydropower plant program (to eliminate fuelwood consumption), a natural forest conservation program (to prevent illegal forest harvesting), and a grain-to-green program (to return cropland to forest).  The interactive effects of these policies on local people and panda habitat are uncertain, however.  The objectives of this research project are (1) to assess the interactions among the three policies and local residents; (2) to evaluate the interrelationships between local residents and panda habitat; (3) to examine the need for and feasibility of policy modification and improvement; and (4) to model and simulate multi-scale interactions among policies, people, and panda habitat across space and time.  The methods to be used in this study include field observations, face-to-face interviews with stakeholders, geographical information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, systems modeling and simulation, and advanced computer visualization techniques.  In addition to addressing many fundamental ecological and socioeconomic questions, the research will be tightly integrated with the education of students from elementary school to graduate school as well as outreach to various stakeholders from local to international levels. <br/><br/>The project will have significant implications for biocomplexity theory, methodology, and application.  In terms of theory, this project will shed light on complex patterns and interrelated processes (e.g., nonlinearity, thresholds, feedback, uncertainty) among multiple policies, humans, and wildlife habitat at multiple spatial and temporal scales.  Regarding methodology, the research will take a systems approach by integrating multidisciplinary methods and advanced technologies to investigate the complexity of the study system.  With respect to application, the project will provide practical information for conserving panda habitat in Wolong, and it will provide useful insights for designing and improving policies that attempt to balance the needs of biodiversity conservation and economic development in the world's most populous nation.  The findings also will be of general interest to many other parts of the world because of escalating human pressures and increasingly complicated human-nature interactions.

It will help researchers, students and stakeholders representing different fields and interest areas to work together on commonly-discussed but differently interpreted concepts such as sustainability and path dependence. Collaboration with the Steward County Community College will bring in underrepresented groups and help disseminating knowledge and interdisciplinary perspective on environmental stewardship at the local level.

Potential consequences of this trend include a reduction of forest-dependent rainfall, the spread of savanna-like scrub vegetation, substantial losses of biodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.  Greater investments in governance of new highway corridors and the strengthening of forest-based economies could favor a more equitable and sustainable developmental pathway that maintains the forest ecosystem.  Policy interventions that could foster this alternative pathway are poorly understood, however, in part because of the complex interactions among ecological, economic, and climatic systems operating across multiple scales spatial and temporal scales in the Amazon region.  The interdisciplinary research project will develop quantitative, spatially explicit models of Amazon land-use change, fire, vegetation dynamics, and carbon flux for a major new highway corridor and for the entire basin.  The ecosystem model will describe fire risk as a function of drought, land use, and disturbance history, and will be coupled to the economic models through land-use effects on the fire regime and through fire-risk effects on the behavior of land users.  The ecosystem model will track vegetation structure and recovery with associated carbon pools to estimate the carbon fluxes and flammability associated with land-use scenarios.  The economic models will first calculate the potential profitability of each pixel for competing agricultural and forestry land uses as a function of infrastructure and biophysical factors determined using satellite data and a large GIS database.  Land uses that actually occupy each pixel will depend on population and urbanization variables that are captured within an econometric model of municipal-level census data and spatial associations that are represented within a cellular automata model.

Conversely, modifications in human activities may significantly affect ecosystem functioning.  This responsiveness makes it necessary to study the interactions between human behavior, natural capital stocks, and the flow of ecosystem services.  Farmers make many decisions about land use and improvement, selection of crop varieties, livestock-management strategies, chemical applications, and labor allocation.  These decisions fundamentally affect the growth of plants, livestock, and soil biology -- in short, the functioning of the entire agroecosystem.  Complex feedback loops send responses to the different subsystems engendering dynamic reactions.  Exogenous shocks, such as those associated with climate variability and changing economic incentives, regularly disrupt processes in this complex system.  Over time, those disturbances propagate throughout the system, causing adaptation in behaviors and performance of the subsystems.  Understanding the interplay between smallholder farmers in Kenya and their natural environment is the primary goal of this project.  Within three Kenyan research sites, Embu in the central highlands, Siaya-Vihiga in the Lake Victoria basin in subhumid western Kenya, and upper Baringo in the Rift valley, some farmers have adapted their agricultural practices to sustain their soils through crop-livestock integration and use of a variety of conservation strategies.  Within the same ecosystem, some farmers are able to maintain soil fertility and farm productivity, while their neighbors are caught in """"natural resource poverty traps"""" that yield food insecurity and agroecosystem degradation.  Studies of the systems that are able to maintain homeostasis as well as those that do not recover from human and natural shocks provide the opportunity to understand the central biophysical and socioeconomic processes that underpin agroecosystem functioning in the tropics.  The investigators will develop a model using a system dynamics approach that includes the complex feedback loops among economic (conditioned by sociological constraints), livestock, crop, and soils submodels.  The model will be calibrated and tested using data on soil status (nutrients, organic matter and microbial profiles), crop yields, plant biomass production, and livestock growth as well as production and socio-economic data.<br/><br/>Depletion of soil fertility is increasingly acknowledged to be the fundamental biophysical cause of declining food production in Africa.  Unless the causes for soil depletion are remedied, it will be impossible to increase food production to meet projected demand due to population growth and to ensure that the 37 percent of the sub-Saharan Africans receiving less that 2,200 calories per day are adequately nourished.  Because this project's research sites vary by ecological zone and market access, they represent systems throughout Africa and much of the developing world.  This research project will permit a comprehensive evaluation of socioeconomic and biophysical factors that contribute to degradation of tropical agroecosystems.  The project will add to limited understanding of the microbial ecology of tropical soils, and to knowledge about when soils reach thresholds beyond which replenishment is difficult.  The project also will contribute to knowledge of the processes through which people become trapped in poverty. The integration of the contributions to individual research areas will be made more useful through integration into a dynamic model that will permit exploration of the responses of these vulnerable systems to economic and biophysical shocks.

In recent years, a major source of water conflict has been the increased extraction of groundwater from areas that are physically connected to rivers and streams with a resulting loss of instream flows.  The impacts of decreased instream flows include reduction of habitat for fish and migratory birds, changes in stream and riparian zone form and habitat, and decreases in water availability for dam and reservoir operation, recreation, and downstream uses.  Although hydrologists have long conducted field studies of the physical aspects of groundwater-surface water exchange, little is known about the feedbacks operating between natural and human components of complex surface water-groundwater systems, which are uncertain, spatially variable, and may include nonlinear and threshold behavior.  Two sites for studying surface water-groundwater systems where an understanding of the complex interactions between human and natural components is critical to effective policy design are the Kankakee River Basin in Illinois and the Republican River Basin in Nebraska and Kansas.  As a result of groundwater pumping, both areas have experienced reduced stream flows that are of concern to policymakers.  The two basins differ dramatically in terms of economics, institutions, history of management, stakeholder conflict, and current policies, however.  The objectives of this interdisciplinary research project are (1) to quantify the economic and social impacts of parameter, model, and behavioral uncertainty in coupled surface water-groundwater systems; (2) to evaluate how spatial and temporal variability in hydrologic processes, individual and social group behavior can affect policy design and decision consequences in surface water-groundwater systems; (3) to analyze the impacts of decision making processes on the development of socially acceptable surface water-groundwater management policies; and (4) to develop efficient and socially acceptable policies to manage surface water-groundwater systems in order to maintain instream water flows.  Methods to be used by the investigators in this study include numerical Bayesian modeling, spatial optimization, a stochastic multi-agent system, econometric analysis, social network analysis, geographical information systems, and advanced visualization techniques.  The research will address fundamental hydrologic and socioeconomic questions while also integrating training and learning activities for K-12 and graduate students and outreach activities for local and international stakeholders.<br/><br/>This research will provide significant advances in the development and calibration of natural system models that integrate feedbacks between and uncertainty in natural processes and human behavior.  The improved scientific models derived from this research will advance policy design that maintains or improves instream environmental conditions while improving economic prospects and minimizing the potential for stakeholder conflict.  By evaluating alternative policy frameworks in the simulation model, the investigators will provide practical information regarding how to improve water resource management and reduce stakeholder conflict in the two study areas.

BC, may significantly affect soil C stocks and rates of CO2 exchange of forests with the atmosphere. Through integrated field and laboratory studies, this research will improve understanding of fundamental biological, chemical and physical controls on BC degradation and transport processes in a northern forest soil. This research will link the charring temperature of BC materials to their chemical and physical structures and their resulting decay rates, activity of the main decomposers, enzyme activities, transport dynamics, and  stabilization mechanisms in soil. The proposed experimental approach will use stable isotope-enriched (13C and 15N) BC materials produced over a range of temperatures (200 to 600ºC) and its precursor wood of jack pine, a fire-prone and abundant tree species in eastern North America, to elucidate the structures of BC materials and track the multiple fates of these materials when added to soil. This approach will permit a direct assessment of the biological turnover in soil using advanced molecular and spectroscopic techniques. This work will provide the first look at the roles of specific groups of microorganisms and soil fauna involved in the decomposition and movement of BC and wood in soils. To test the effects of plant species on BC chemical and physical structures, highly 13C- and 15N-enriched BC from red maple will be compared with the jack pine. Resulting data and knowledge will contribute to ongoing efforts to predict terrestrial C cycling, and will inform ecosystem and climate modelers and also land use managers.<br/><br/>Most existing climate models predict that temperate and boreal forests will experience greater fire frequency under a warmer future climate, thereby increasing BC (black carbon) contributions to soils. In addition, substantial BC (or """"biochar"""") production is expected from the energy industry. This research will characterize the key biological, chemical and physical controls on BC and wood degradation processes in soils, thereby substantially increasing our understanding of the mechanisms involved in C stabilization and sequestration in fire-prone forests. This will provide information needed to improve ecosystem and global C cycling models and their uses in characterizing forest soil C sinks in present and future climates. This research will inform a broad scientific, educational, land manager and agency community interested in ecosystem function, productivity and sustainability. In addition, the project will include involvement of a science teacher from a New York City minority-serving high school and the NY GLOBE Metro program to integrate applied environmental ecosystem science and geosciences into the high school biology and earth science curricula.

The COMSES (COmputational Modeling for SocioEcological Science) network aims to be broadly inclusive of social and natural scientists using (and desiring to use) advanced modeling to study coupled natural and human, or 'socioecological systems' (SES). <br/><br/>The often non-linear, non-intuitive, and even surprising relationships and consequences that emerge from complex interactions between human social practice and the biophysical environment make it imperative that scientific models - including their underlying assumptions, algorithmic processes, logical consistency, and connections with empirical data - be transparent and quantitative. For this reason, computational modeling in general and agent-based modeling (ABM) in particular are important tools for research in socioecological sciences. Yet ABM remains little used or understood in the broader scientific communities involved in the science of coupled natural and human systems. Rather, it is widely perceived as inaccessible to social and natural scientists in spite of the fact that ABM has existed as a potential research tool for nearly two decades. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the COMSES network is to serve as a coordinated community of practice and a conduit to expedite knowledge exchange for computational modeling in SES. The network will build on the NSF-funded OpenABM Consortium http://www.openabm.org.  It will seek to grow scientific infrastructure so as to better serve research that uses computational modeling by:<br/><br/>- establishing an interactive, online archive for computational models and providing standard tools and data for model evaluation;<br/>- promoting a common standard for describing models;<br/>- developing educational curricula for embedding modeling and computational thinking in the interdisciplinary study of social and natural sciences.<br/>- establishing a new e-journal dedicated to publishing research in the social and natural sciences that involves computational modeling, and studies of modeling methods and empirical evaluation.<br/><br/>Through the development of exemplar curricula and training opportunities, the project will endeavor to stimulate new interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students at multiple levels who represent the next generation of scientists. With the ever-increasing importance of information technology and related cybertools in today's world, training in advanced modeling techniques and their application in the social sciences will broadly benefit students' careers. <br/><br/>Many of the environmental challenges that we face in the 21st century may also be considered social problems because they affect our quality of life and can only be addressed by human actions.  The COMSES network has the potential to transform the social and natural sciences in profound ways by developing computational tools and expertise that will help us to gain a much deeper understanding of the relationships between humans and their environment, and allow us to better predict the likely effects of future policies and decisions."

When this agropastoral economy first appeared in the Mediterranean basin in the early Holocene, nearly 10,000 years ago, it represented a dramatic reorganization of human ecology.  It involved increasingly intensive efforts by farming peoples to control environmental factors favorable to the life cycle of domestic plants and animals, with a consequent cascade of complexly interlinked effects on regional landscapes and human society.  Agropastoral land use remains the most significant way in which humans impact natural landscapes, and the recursive social effects of these impacts are important global issues.  However, landscape evolution takes place over the course of decades, centuries, and even millennia.  Even the loss of a landscape's ability to support a people and their subsistence economy is often the result of longer-term changes that are most apparent at the resolution of the prehistoric record.  Only by studying this long-term record can people truly begin to appreciate the real consequences of past and present land-use decisions on earth's landscapes and society and use this understanding to make more informed decisions today.  The longest and best-studied record of the ways in which human activities have transformed the world is found in the Mediterranean Basin, encompassing both the earliest known agricultural land use and the earliest civilizations to become dependent on these human-managed socioecosystems.  Decades of intensive study by archaeologists, geoscientists, and ecologists have amassed rich and diverse data about human-environmental interaction in this region.  This interdisciplinary research project will integrate this information with recent advances in geospatial modeling and agent simulation to create a natural laboratory for investigating the long-term social and ecological consequences of alternate land-use practices.  In this project, the modeling laboratory will be used to study (1) the effects the of growth in agropastoral systems on biodiversity; (2) the changing impacts of land-use intensification and diversification on landscapes, their resilience, and vulnerability to degradation; and (3) the long-term sustainability of human maintained socioecosystems in varying environmental and social contexts.  The study will focus on two ecologically diverse regions at opposite ends of the Mediterranean Basin, eastern Spain and the southern Levant in Jordan.  These two regions encompass much of the social and natural variability of the entire Mediterranean Basin.<br/><br/>This project will generate significant new knowledge about long-term consequences of alternative land-use practices that can help communities make more responsible and effective decisions about land use today.  It will also generate integrated archaeological and paleoenvironmental datasets, and dynamic land use-landscape modeling algorithms that will be disseminated via the internet, conferences, and publications for use by researchers addressing other socioecological questions.  The research is tightly integrated with an active educational program for undergraduate and graduate students especially geared towards hands on training in the research process, and collaborative transdisciplinary work.

While discussed extensively in the ecological literature, the extent to which biocomplexity translates into tangible social and economic benefits to communities and their economies remains essentially unexplored. Our research will investigate how the biocomplexity of fisheries ecosystems translates into social and economic attributes of the human communities that exploit these ecosystems. Because human activities often feed back to affect the biocomplexity of ecosystems, we will further explore how human effects on the inherent variability of ecosystems affect the socio-economics of human communities. By coupling our understanding of how biocomplexity affects humans, and how human actions affect natural system biocomplexity, we will be in a position to inform efficient biocomplexity policy. While the methods, design, and results of this research program will be genera1izable across a range of coupled human and natural systems, we focus on the salmon-producing ecosystems of Western Alaska where we have extensive knowledge of the natural biocomplexity of the ecosystems, where the regional socio economic activities are supported almost exclusively by fisheries, and where tight feedbacks exist between natural and human components of the ecosystems. These features make these particular systems highly tractable to integrated bioeconomic assessment and modeling.<br/><br/>We seek to understand the interactions between the ecological dynamics of salmon ecosystems and the social and economic benefits to people who rely on salmon for their livelihoods in Western Alaska. In particular we are interested in understanding how the reliability of annual salmon returns, as determined by the biocomplexity of salmon stocks and their watersheds, affects the long-term economic performance of fisheries and the ability of local residents to participate salmon fisheries. We will also explore how management strategies should change as multiple ecosystem objectives are included into policy. In particular, current management objectives are focused narrowly on maximizing biological yield to commercial fisheries without consideration for the ecological and associated economic benefits of salmon in freshwater ecosystems (e.g., via sport fishing). Further, we will assess the degree to which fishermen and their communities benefit from the opportunity to generalize their efforts to exploit multiple species and multiple ecosystems as an alternative to the specialization that current management systems tend to encourage. This work will provide key insights into the complex interactions between social-economic dynamics and the ecological dynamics of fisheries and other coupled natural-human ecosystems."

Even in marine ecosystems, evidence has accumulated that many fisheries may not be sustainable.  This lack of sustainability stems in part from the inability of the fish populations to generate enough surplus production to meet the expectations of the fisheries.  In addition to this biotic dimension, however, there are equally important human dimensions, including regulations, investments in vessels and gear, locations of communities, property rights and fishing licenses, and other traditional and cultural aspects of fishing.  Aquatic ecologists have described many aspects of the complexity of biotic systems that affect the productivity of fish populations, including diversity of phsical habitats, effects of changing environmental conditions, intra-specific competition, nutrient cycling, and community dynamics.  These studies have not been adequately integrated, however, with work on the complexity of human systems, the commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries that are intimately and inextricably linked to the population dynamics of the fishes.  The sockeye salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska, present an ideal opportunity to understand the linkages between complex biotic and human systems, thereby extending basic understanding of these critical components of healthy human and natural communities.  These fisheries, operating at commercial levels for a century, are among the best examples of sustainability, yet their complexity has only recently been investigated.  Sockeye salmon breed in streams, ponds, rivers, and beaches associated with large lakes in five major drainage basins, and their offspring rear in the lakes for one or two years before migrating to sea for another two or three years.  Tens of millions of these salmon return as adults each year, and fractions of the total are caught in mobile gillnet fisheries, fixed-site set net fisheries, recreational fisheries, and subsistence fisheries.  Forecasts and in-season information are used by managers to decide on appropriate levels of fishing and by fishermen do decide where to fish.  The forecasts are based on scientific information derived from research on climate-related and density-dependent processes governing the dynamics of the salmon populations.<br/><br/>The primary concepts of interest in this interdisciplinary research project are the resilience of the biotic system (in this case, salmon abundance and diversity) to harvest and environmental change and the resilience of the human communities in the face of these changes in salmon abundance and associated changes in price and costs of fishing.  The fundamental hypothesis is that the ability of the salmon populations to persist in the face of changing environmental conditions and the ability of the human communities to persist in the face of changing social and economic forces both depend on the diversity of """"life history"""" strategies as well as a blend of site attachment and mobility.  The overall objective of this research project is to test this hypothesis and thereby understand the coupling between salmon populations and human communities.  The project will pursue this objective with five themes at increasing levels of scale:  (1) the links between genetics and life history traits of salmon that result from post-glacial colonization and contemporary homing and gene flow, (2) the role of climate in determining the productivity of salmon populations using different breeding habitats and different nursery lakes, (3) the importance of marine-derived nutrients (from salmon carcasses) in the productivity of lake ecosystems and success of salmon populations, (4) the ways in which the current fishery management policy of maximum sustainable yield could be modified to consider economic and ecological processes to the benefit of both humans and the natural ecosystem, and (5) the extent to which the regulatory policies should consider the behavior of fishermen in an effort to rationalize the size and capacity of the fisheries.  The project will be closely coordinated with the agency regulating the fisheries (Alaska Department of Fish and Game) and the community development organizations in the area (especially the Bristol Bay Native Association).  Outreach efforts will include extensive contacts with local schools and economic development groups.  The findings will have significant implications for theories of sustainability and broad application to the many other systems where human communities depend on natural resources that are subject to the effects of those humans, and to external environmental changes.

For example, substantial improvements in water quality and clarity in Lake Erie achieved in the 1970s and 1980s through the reduction in external phosphorus loadings from point sources have been followed by a period of lakeside recreational and residential development that extends to the present.  More recently, increases in phosphorus concentrations and the frequency of harmful algal blooms in the lake have combined with other biophysical conditions to generate """"surprise events,"""" such as the, expansion of the summertime """"Dead Zone"""" and adult gamefish kills.  While linkages between the human and biophysical systems clearly are key factors producing these changes, their underlying structural dynamics and the extent to which the linkages have led to fundamental and perhaps irreversible changes in biological and human processes is unknown.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine the coupled linkages between lake functioning and lake-related human activities and explore how these couplings generate nonlinear changes in ecological outcomes, such as water quality and fish stocks, and human behavior, including land use and lake-based recreational activities.  Of particular interest are the conditions under which coupled linkages lead to bifurcations or other """"surprise"""" outcomes that may not occur in their absence and the influence of fine-scale variations, time-delayed feedbacks, and stochastic processes that may be embedded in the couplings.  The objectives of this research are (1) to construct a simple, coarse-scale model of a generic large lake ecosystem with coupled human-biophysical interactions that can be used to examine system dynamics and the role of human-biophysical couplings; (2) to develop a more detailed, fine-scale model by increasing the model's spatial and temporal resolution and, parameterizing the model using Lake Erie data and use this model to test hypotheses regarding the impact of human activities on lake eutrophication and the impact of these ecological changes on land and economic development in the Lake Erie region; and (3) to use this set of models to study the impacts of historical policies and new management strategies of large lakes on both human and biophysical processes.

By testing hypotheses regarding the coupled linkages between human and biophysical large lake processes and examining the way in which these interactions influence the self-organization and resiliency of biological and human systems, the project will make an original contribution to the scientific understanding of large lake biocomplexity.  The research will make methodological contributions by advancing methods used to study the stability and multiscale properties of complex, coupled systems.  By providing a better understanding of how feedbacks occur between lake functioning and human behavioral responses, the results will generate social benefits by providing information to policy makers who seek to protect lake resources while also providing high-quality amenities to people.

Cities cover only one to two percent of Earth's surface, but they are important hotspots of biogeochemical cycling because they concentrate the consumption of food and energy that are produced beyond their boundaries.  Cities therefore are largely unsustainable, requiring large imports of fossil fuels, food, and water.  Furthermore, cities are important sources of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants resulting from fossil fuel combustion and waste generation that lead to nutrient loading downwind and downstream.  Little is known about the socio-ecological coupling between human behavioral factors and biogeochemical cycles, however.  This collaborative research project seeks to understand the coupling between household biogeochemical fluxes and socioeconomic factors along an urban to exurban gradient in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) metropolitan region in Minnesota.  The investigators will focus on household consumption because it contributes substantially to urban biogeochemical cycling and because it is potentially flexible and therefore amenable to reduction in response to changes in factors that influence household choices.  As part of the ongoing Twin Cities Household Ecosystem Project (TCHEP), a social survey of 3,100 households was conducted along an urban-to-exurban gradient, and landscape characteristics were surveyed for a subset of households.  Survey data about key behaviors that influence biogeochemical fluxes, such as motor vehicle travel, air travel, diet, pets, and lawn care, are used as input to a Household Flux Calculator to generate total and component carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) fluxes for each household.  The survey also gathered demographic data and linked behaviors with household attitudes, norms, and perceived control.  This project will use the TCHEP database to examine how behavioral, demographic, and biophysical factors influence household decisions and, thus, the fluxes of C, N, and P through households along a gradient of housing density.  The investigators will determine the effect of consumption and pollution produced by single family households on fluxes of C, N, and P at the scale of the urban study region, and they will examine how behaviors can be influenced by messages exchanged through social networks to change consumption choices and elemental fluxes.  The project therefore will examine the feedback loop between household choices and elemental fluxes.  Elucidating the nature of such socio-environmental coupling should stimulate novel approaches to making cities more sustainable, reducing urban pollution, and reducing urban contributions to climate change.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to advance understanding of integrated human-biophysical interactions in urban ecosystems towards improved knowledge and management of urban biogeochemical cycles.  The study will quantify the effect of behavioral flexibility and its underlying behavioral controls on elemental fluxes through households.  Enhanced understanding of the coupling between human behavior and biogeochemistry is expected to transform approaches to reducing pollution through identification of behavioral changes that reduce pollutant sources.  The project will provide extensive education and training of numerous undergraduate and graduate fellows s well as post-doctoral researchers.  It will develop an interactive web page for non-scientists in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota's Science Buzz web project.  The investigators will use the HFC model as a teaching tool in undergraduate courses and disseminate the TCHEP survey tool, the TCHEP database, and the HFC tool through the world-wide web.  Project outcomes should facilitate the development of new paradigms to pollution control that are based on source reduction, information feedback loops to guide adaptive management, and greater citizen involvement.

The overall goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to couple human behavior with flows of macroelements (C, N, and P) through households.  The investigators will quantify total fluxes of C, N, and P through households in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, and they will look to expand basic understanding of the factors that influence household choices regarding consumption and macroelement fluxes through households.  The investigators hypothesize that element fluxes are highly variable and skewed, with relatively few households contributing disproportionately to overall fluxes.  Another hypothesis to be tested posits that the magnitude of elemental fluxes through households can be predicted from knowledge of daily consumption choices along with long-term choices regarding household infrastructure, such as house size and lawn area.  To test these hypotheses, 400 owner-occupied, single unit households in Ramsey County will be randomly selected to cover a range of household characteristics.  These households will be studied using an intensive mail survey, a landscape inventory, and homeowner energy bills.  Data will be entered into a previously developed Household Flux Calculator (HFC) model to generate fluxes of C, N, and P.  Survey data will additionally be used to link element fluxes with factors related to human choices like attitudes, norms, perceived control, and demographic factors.<br/><br/>This project is expected to integrate human choice and biophysical characteristics into a model of household biogeochemistry using a transdisciplinary approach that integrates biophysical and social research approaches.  The project will provide research opportunities for post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduate students.  By incorporating the HFC directly into classroom education, it will allow students to explore hypotheses regarding impacts of consumption.  In addition, project outcomes will be used to help develop a new paradigm for pollution control, one based on source reduction and information feedback loops to guide adaptive management.

Their use of the ice requires detailed knowledge of ice conditions for both safety and success in hunting, their main livelihood.  The sea-ice environment in the Arctic is changing, however.  Studies of sea-ice characteristics from scientific and indigenous knowledge perspectives have found major changes in the extent and thickness of the Arctic ice pack as well as local and regional changes in certain characteristics like the thickness, stability, and dates of formation of the shorefast ice used by hunters.  As a result, Inuit and Inupiat communities are making changes to their day-to-day and long-term livelihood strategies and are dealing with traditional knowledge and skills that are, at times, no longer applicable.  At the same time, scientists struggle to understand the interactions of the forces influencing sea-ice changes and variations of change at multiple scales.  How can these two groups inform each other and benefit from collaboration on this topic of mutual concern?  This project will investigate the dynamics of the coupled systems of Inuit and Inupiat hunters and shorefast or drifting sea ice in the context of environmental change.  A multidisciplinary team of investigators will collaborate with the communities of Barrow, Alaska, and Clyde River, Nunavut, to carry out this investigation.  The main objectives of the project are (1) to document Inuit and Inupiat knowledge and use of sea ice along with those factors that limit or enable this use, (2) to document Inuit and Inupiat observations and perspectives on sea-ice changes and correlate these with scientific observations, (3) to examine the differences and similarities in sea-ice changes and community interactions with them in the Baffin Bay and Chukchi Sea locales, and (4) to document how Inuit and Inupiat cope with changes in sea ice in their respective regions as well as how different approaches in one region may inform the other regarding adaptation strategies.<br/><br/>Anticipated intellectual contributions of this project include illumination of frameworks for integrating scientific and indigenous knowledge, particularly the integration of traditional and scientific views of ice conditions and the comparison of large-scale trends with local changes in sea ice.  Anticipated broader impacts of this project include training and education of indigenous Arctic communities, scientists and graduate students in practical and theoretical studies of environmental changes and their consequences.

Irrigated land is responsible for more than 85 percent of global consumptive water use, producing approximately 45 percent of the global food supply on only 20 percent of global cropland.  The combination of the increasing use of irrigation in agricultural production and the importance of snowmelt in many agricultural areas has led to a situation where more than one-sixth of the world's population relies on glaciers and seasonal snow packs as their primary source of streamflow.  Climate change processes are projected to impact the amount of snowfall and the seasonality of discharge around the globe.  Temperature effects of climate change alone will be sufficient to alter both snowpack accumulation and snowmelt dynamics of many agricultural systems.  While additional climate change impacts on growing season rainfall, streamflow, and drought could serve to either exacerbate or mitigate shifts in snowmelt climatology on water available for crops, the dependence on snowmelt and irrigation in many agricultural systems may reduce their ability to respond to future changes.  Of additional concern is the fact that many temperate and tropical agricultural areas dependent on glacial meltwater are now facing the threat of complete glacier loss, making climate changes in these regions potentially more disruptive than in areas where only seasonal snowmelt is used as a water resource.  In the face of water shortages, governance institutions established to allocate water may be disrupted and forced to change.  Critical tensions exist between the potential impacts of climate change and existing and future patterns of water use in regions highly dependent on glacier-fed streamflow for agricultural irrigation.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine how human populations will be impacted by these changes and the capacity of users in glacier-irrigated agricultural systems to adapt.  The investigators will examine semi-arid agricultural systems that are dependent on snowmelt located across strongly contrasting institutional and hydrological settings in eastern Kenya and the western United States.  They will integrate information gathered from focus groups, water-user interviews, field hydrological measurements, role-playing games, and scenario-based models of potential climate change impacts to assess community vulnerability to climate variability and understand how communities might respond to changes in water availability in the future.  They will address interactions among human actors, the physical and social capital they construct and maintain, and the dynamics of water availability and allocation across spatial scales.<br/><br/>This project will have significant implications for the governance of water resources and how communities and households cope with water scarcity.  The empirical analysis of past and present water governance will support the development of scenario-based models of potential climate change impacts to assess community vulnerability to climate variability and to understand how communities might respond to changes in water availability in the future.  Findings from this project will be of value to policy makers who are seeking more nuanced policy responses than simple """"one size fits all"""" solutions. Many policy analysts recommend one-type of governance, such as government or private ownership, as being """"ideal"""" to cope with threats to ecological systems.  This research will develop new knowledge about the ways in which institutional diversity can contribute to the effective management of water resources.

Many current conceptualizations of these transformations assume a simple linear model, however, positing that change is driven by present-day economic, demographic, and technological conditions. This interdisciplinary research project will trace the effects of the introduction, spread, and abandonment of agriculture at six sites in the U.S., with comparisons also made with comparable sites in Mexico and France.  The U.S. sites are members of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network.  This project incorporates an integrated, long-term cycle that includes land-use change affecting landscapes, altered landscapes affecting ecological processes, and both influencing the ways in which humans monitor and respond to their surroundings, which engender further cycles of change.  The central objective of this research is to identify and quantify the ways in which these integrated cycles differ across cultures, across biogeographic regions, and across time.  A suite of quantitative and narrative analyses will be used to identify the prime determinants of long-term dynamics, present-day patterns, and reservoirs of ecological and social resilience in these systems.  Analytical approaches will include structural-equation modeling, analysis of spatial and causal effects, and cross-site comparisons of case studies.  As a practical test of the project's results, approaches and insights that includes an emphasis on eco-regional planning and scenario building will be examined in the context of conservation planning at The Nature Conservancy (TNC).<br/><br/>This project will contribute to both science and society in many ways.  It will demonstrate the importance of social science information and approaches in ecosystem investigations, expanding the results of the LTER network and breaching the divide between social and natural science.  The data protocols developed will also benefit other communities of social and natural scientists through the involvement of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), a major national repository of social science data.  This project will help to develop general theories on how socio-ecological legacies, as well as lags in the recognition of and response to change, vary across space and time.  Through detailed case histories and quantitative analyses, the project expects to provide convincing evidence that humans act not only to disturb ecosystems but also monitor ecosystem values and respond to maintain stability and minimize crises.  Project results will provide information of direct use to policy makers, TNC, and land managers by using an approach that explicitly relates socio-ecological processes to varying levels of political organization.  The cross-scale data collection and analyses are expected to demonstrate that some patterns of human-ecological interactions are surprisingly long term, vary across space and time, and are non-linear.  The project's most significant long-term contribution may prove to be through education; as this project will train new interdisciplinary scientists at all levels of the educational spectrum, inform public officials, and contribute to more effective land-management practices.

This sprawl has large impacts on natural and rural landscapes, ecosystem services, and quality of life for millions of people. This project investigates the processes linking dynamics of land-atmosphere carbon budgets in exurban residential areas, preferences for land-cover types and patterns on these lands, and land-management activities of residents and developers. The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management. Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers,<br/><br/>The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change. Coupled computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments. Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget. The project strengthens scientific capacity and integration by bringing together scientists from a wide range of fields including landscape architecture, ecosystem science, economics, geographic information science, and complex systems science. The project will produce results that improve our ability to model (a) carbon cycling in the heterogeneous landscapes that humans inhabit, (b) the economic incentives inherent in our management exurban landscapes, and (c) the linkages between peoples? preferences and their behaviors and ecological landscape function. Models developed for the project will be used to generate both formal and informal educational materials for both graduate and undergraduate instruction on environmental science, policy, and design, in order to improve student understanding of how complex coupled human-environment dynamics can complicate decision making about ecosystem services, and how spatial and dynamic modeling can improve our understanding of alternative options in such settings."

We will establish and collaborate with four agent panels composed of representatives of the community of interest to identify alternative decisions for either minimizing net wildfire risk or maximizing expected return on investment in defensive fire measures. Our measure of net wildfire risk is somewhat unique because it accounts for both the expected losses and expected benefits of wildfires. We will evaluate how agents can adapt their wildfire-related decisions to future climate change and future expansion of residential development into wildland areas using an adaptive management framework that employs Bayesian statistical analysis for the risk case and the minimax regret criterion for the uncertainty case. Climate change futures will be based on IPCC scenarios, and residential development into wildland areas for alternative economic growth and land use policy futures will be simulated using the Ecosystem Landscape Modeling System. <br/><br/>The project is the first study of its kind to assess how future climate change and future expansion of residential development into wildland areas influences wildfire and wildfire risk in the WUI.

Studying this system as a whole will improve our ability to predict risks of mosquito vector and dengue virus exposure and the possible impacts of future climate change. <br/><br/>Dengue viruses circulate between mosquitoes and humans, causing an estimated 100 million human dengue infections annually. In the last decade, the Americas have experienced a dramatic increase in severe cases (dengue hemorrhagic fever), with devastating public health consequences. As neither vaccines nor therapeutics are yet available, mosquito control is the main option for preventing and controlling dengue outbreaks. Efforts in this area have been hindered by a poor understanding of the dengue virus transmission system at the interface between its natural and human components. Of particular concern is the potential for dengue fever to expand into areas that are presently outside transmission zones but may become vulnerable under scenarios of future climate change. For example, this potential expansion poses a risk to the ~19 million people in and near Mexico City, a high altitude """"island"""" currently free of dengue but surrounded by dengue virus transmission at lower altitudes. <br/><br/>Specific aims of the project are to: (1) determine how weather/climate factors are related to the presence and abundance of disease-carrying mosquitoes, especially by serving as barriers to mosquitoes becoming established in an area; (2) use these results in high-resolution atmospheric models to develop a predictive model for future mosquito range expansion; (3) determine which aspects of human behavior and attributes of man-made environments are most closely related to Ae. aegypti presence and abundance; (4) employ state-of-the-science data assimilation procedures to validate, refine, and define uncertainty in this modeling framework. Key aspects of this coupled natural and human system will be studied along an altitudinal transect in Mexico, ranging from coastal, low-elevation environments with well established vector mosquito populations and intense dengue virus transmission to high-elevation, mountainous areas which currently are free of the mosquito vector and local virus transmission. The team of experts from Mexico and the United States includes climatologists, vector ecologists, modelers and medical anthropologists.<br/><br/>The project will contribute essential insights into the ongoing debate about climate change and infectious disease relationships, extending beyond the explicit vector ecology and geographic boundaries of this study. The work will provide quantitative knowledge that can be used to develop novel strategies to control Ae. aegypti in the face of future threats to system resilience. Further, it will provide training for a postdoctoral fellow in climate modeling and spatial risk modeling at both Colorado State University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research and involvement and in situ training of university and secondary school students in data collection.

One result of this international tragedy of the commons is the sudden collapse of once-abundant stocks, such as the Pacific anchovetta and the North Atlantic cod, along with the fisheries they supported. On the other hand, for some overfished stocks such as northern Atlantic swordfish and eastern Pacific bigeye tuna, countries have cooperated and invested to reduce harvests, giving the stocks a chance to rebuild and the fisheries time to recover.  Our project will identify the major sources of stability and instability that lead to such wide variation across otherwise similar systems. We will do this by creating, validating, and exploring 'Fishscape', a fully integrated, geo-spatial model of the international fishery targeting tropical tunas in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). Coupling the human and natural elements in this complex system - the oceans, the fish, the fishers, the markets, and even the political policies - is the only way to fully understand the observed dynamics of resilience and collapse. By connecting realistic models of oceanographic conditions, fish population dynamics, and fisher behavior, Fishscape will shed light on still-unanswered key ecological questions, such as the relationships among nutrient availability, ocean currents, and reproductive success in a pelagic environment. Realistic assumptions about fishers' biases and shortcuts will also be integrated into Fishscape, yielding measures of the effects of factors like skipper skill, technological change, and market forces on relative gains among national fishing fleets. Once the model is cross-validated, the project will use robust decision making methods to explore through simulation over a wide range of social and ecological factors to discover what makes the system resilient and what leads to instability. Specifically, we will test three meta-scenarios: (1) climate change, (2) increasing price of oil, and (3) technological improvements, in order to identify sources of stability and instability within the system. <br/><br/>Top predators like tuna are critical to marine ecosystems, global food supplies, and international industries. Identifying sources of resilience or collapse in these systems could prevent much of the suffering that has been seen in other fisheries. Fishscape provides a tool that explores relative and absolute gains. It will break down barriers to cooperation by moving focus away from conflict over who gets what - and the related inability to prevent the decline of stocks - to agreement on management that can improve conditions for everyone, even the fish. Participation in the Fishscape education program should lead people to think about environmental trade-offs differently: as a complex but comprehensible part of daily life, rather than as a desperate search for a single sub-optimal solution."

There is little land that is not to some degree a consequence of its human inhabitants.  Given the capacity of modern societies to alter both the atmosphere and ocean, even remote and unpopulated landscapes are to some degree altered by human activity.  But does this human activity affect the stability of the natural-human system?  What is the natural-human system's resistance to change?  What is its resilience (the likelihood of returning to its original state after being disturbed)?  While people often assume that the answer to these questions must be in the affirmative, this project will assess the question quantitatively and qualitatively through advanced socio-environmental systems analysis.  This proposal will characterize, quantify, and model the spectrum of coupled natural-human dynamics on the Eastern Shore of Virginia over the past 500 years as, first, Native Americans and, later, European and African colonists and their descendents interacted with their environment.  This interdisciplinary study is designed to improve understanding of the complex dynamics of a tightly coupled natural-human system in a single locale, but at varying spatial and temporal scales and under differing social and environmental pressures.  These efforts will culminate in the development of integrated human-ecosystem models, which will be parameterized, calibrated, and validated by historical, archaeological, ecological, and geochemical data to simulate natural-human systems during specific historical periods that represent changes in human demographic patterns, land-use practices, and technological capabilities:  Protohistoric (1550-1610); Colonial (1650-1700); Late Plantation (1800-1850); Commercial/Industrial (1850-1950); and Modern/Conservation (1950-present).  Three working hypotheses will be investigated to understand and compare a range of landscape- and seascape-scale ecosystems in terms of their dynamic responses:  (1) Systems with more technological societies are better able to resist change from environmental perturbation.  (2) Systems with more technological societies are more resilient to environmental perturbation.  (3) Technological societies are themselves the critical environmental perturbation that drives the future status of the system.  Principal component analysis and other quantitative procedures will be employed to assess system stability, resiliency, and resistance to change during and between these time periods and to identify those system components within time periods that are most critical to resistance, resilience, and stability.<br/><br/>Anticipated intellectual contributions of this project include identifying constraints imposed by nature on humans in order to explain the range of adaptive poses assumed by human societies, assessing the response of the greater natural-human system to the activities of human societies over a broad range of time periods and through examination of distinctive demographic, land use, and technological regimes within the same locale.  Anticipated broader impacts of this project include increase knowledge about natural-human dynamics on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, in particular, and countless other inhabited land-water interfaces throughout the world in general.  The project will identify variables critical to system resistance, resilience, and stability, thereby informing policymaking in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and similar locales throughout the world.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, and the general public.

The acequias of the southwestern United States are community irrigation systems that are based largely on ancient technology introduced to the region by 16th-century settlers.  Acequias consist of gravity-fed earthen canals that divert stream flow for distribution to fields.  They lie at the center of a set of complex self-maintaining interactions between culture and nature that appear to enable drought survival and maintain other sociocultural and ecosystem benefits.  Local water management groups inherent in acequias ensure equitable distribution of water to each community, allocating less water for all users in dry years and more in wet years.  Acequias help maintain community identity and cohesion, economic sustainability, enhanced floodplain hydrologic function, and wildlife habitat.  Contemporary acequia-based communities face new socioeconomic and natural resource pressures that threaten their existence, however.  Population growth is accelerating the change from agricultural to residential land and water uses, while climate change threatens to bring warmer winters with less precipitation and earlier spring snowmelt.  Traditional acequias create and sustain intrinsic linkages between human and natural systems that increase community and ecosystem resilience to climatic and socioeconomic stresses.  Greater knowledge about these interconnections and what can cause them to change or fail will be essential to determine how the communities relying on acequias can adapt to changing conditions.  This interdisciplinary research project will explore socioeconomic and cultural linkages within and between acequia communities and associated landscapes; hydrologic linkages between surface water and groundwater in irrigated river valleys and contributing watersheds; and wildlife habitat and grazing distribution connections between valley riparian areas and upland forests and grasslands.  The investigators will quantify the role of acequias in hydrologic function, community resilience, and ecosystem health, and they will identify potential tipping points for acequia community survival.  Integrative tools informed by examinations of socioeconomic, cultural, and ecohydrological factors will indicate the resilience level of acequia-centered systems.  A system dynamics model will simulate effects of climate and land-use stressors on relationships between economic, social, cultural, climatic, hydrologic, vegetation, and wildlife components.  The model will quantify the magnitude of stressors needed to undermine community and ecosystem resilience.  Mapping will capture spatial linkages and help communicate the findings to a larger audience.<br/><br/>This project will provide new insights into the relationships between traditional water management systems, communities, and landscapes.  It will broaden participation of minorities by conducting research in rural Hispanic communities.  Community members will be active participants in the project and help determine keys to their own community survival.  Project results will be made available to researchers, policy makers, local stakeholders, and the general public through scientific publications, presentations, extension documents, and workshops.  Teachers from the region will be involved in participatory training in order to reach K-12 students.  Undergraduate students will be directly involved in the research, as will graduate students who will be trained as future scientists and community leaders.  A major museum exhibit will integrate spirituality and sense of place into presentation of community resource governance.  Cross-pollination of ideas with international experts will take place through a global comparative workshop and a comparative study in Chile.  Policy guidance resulting from this study should help maintain acequia communities and similar common-pool resource systems worldwide.

The central organizing principle is that landscape patterns and changes in river and road network structure and function are explained by energy and time optimizations of water flows, biota, and humans.  The importance of road and river network intersections in determining dynamic changes to landscapes will be tested using individual/agent-based simulation modeling that integrates field-based physical, biological, and social models.  The investigators will focus on the road-river linkages because river ecosystems are vulnerable to human-related perturbations that are related to road access, such as invasion by non-native species and over-harvesting of fish and shellfish.  The main overarching hypothesis is that an integrated, individual-based model will more accurately predict environmental effects than any single physical, biotic, or social model by reducing unexplained variation.  The mechanism generating this reduction in variance results from including cross-disciplinary connections and corresponding agent feedbacks that otherwise would be missing in the individual disciplinary models.  In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators will develop an integrated individual-based model of physical, biotic, and social networks.  Through analyses of a case study in Puerto Rico, the investigators expect to demonstrate that river and road intersections bring about interaction of aquatic species and visitors with mutual feedbacks.  Dynamic interactions are captured by interdependent functions of each individual agent on each other and each subsystem.  The approach therefore will integrate multidisciplinary field studies in geomorphology, engineering, aquatic ecology, and social science into a unified, individual-based model that will evaluate different dimensions of interacting human and natural systems.  The experimental design and modeling will rely on an existing natural continuum of land use, road densities, and road types within a network structure that reflects a hierarchy of land uses as well as geomorphic and riverine features.<br/><br/>The project will make theoretical, policy, and educational contributions to societal understanding of biocomplexity.  In terms of education, two high school teacher workshops will demonstrate the use of web-based GIS models to actively engage high school seniors (and their teachers) in Puerto Rico and Colorado.  The project will involve extensive participation by undergraduate and graduate research assistants and multi-institution graduate seminars in biocomplexity that will directly engage students, faculty investigators, and managers in the implementation and integration of interdisciplinary research.  Graduate students at University of Puerto Rico will obtain field data on ecological and economic values of rivers in Puerto Rico.  The results will also provide information about the consequences of building new roads and closing existing roads in tropical rainforest settings.  The findings regarding how individual/agent-based models are effective in integrating and visualizing feedback from physical, biological, and social network interactions will be disseminated.  Results of this research should increase understanding of the natural variability of large tropical drainage systems, and the methods to be developed should have broader applicability for coastal-montane ecosystems ranging from North America to New Zealand. Furthermore, we will develop a deeper understanding of how network theory enhances communication and insight across multiple disciplines.

This interdisciplinary research project will investigate the effects of anticipated climatic change on the agricultural heartland of the central United States and how adaptations to climate change will generate new landscape patterns.  As a coupled natural-human system with climatic, agrotechnology, market, and policy feedbacks, future landscapes will differ from current patterns in terms of water quantity, water quality, and agricultural production.  The investigators will focus their attention on three central sets of research questions:  (1) How will 21st-century climate change, together with changing market and policy environments, affect land-use patterns at various scales ranging from the central U.S. as a whole to macroscale regions like the """"Corn Belt"""" to mesoscale watersheds to individual farms and fields?  How will this change the geography of agricultural production?  (2) Under what policies and prices does landscape change induced by climate change generate a positive or a negative feedback through changes in carbon storage, evapotranspiration, and albedo in agricultural landscapes?  (3) Will climate change expand or diminish the agricultural production and ecosystem service generation capacities of mesoscale watersheds representative of agricultural regions?  These questions will be answered using linked methodologies, starting with downscaling of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios based on the 5th Assessment Report of the IPCC for 2020-2025, 2030-2035, 2060-2065, and 2095-2100 that will drive agent-based models of farmer behavior.  From these scenarios, land-use change models utilizing the NASS/USDA Cropland Data Layer will generate most-likely landscapes for the American agricultural heartland.  The SWAT watershed model then will be used to derive estimates of stream flow, sediment, and nutrient loads, which will be used in conjunction with carbon storage estimates from EPIC in a genetic algorithm to derive ecological-economic production possibility frontiers for each representative watershed for each time period for each climatic scenario.   The investigators hypothesize that climatic change will diminish agricultural and ecologic potentials in some regions, such as through reduced water availability, while it will expand in other areas, such as through lengthening of the growing season, but these effects will be greatly influenced through market and policy developments, such as biofuel production and carbon credits. <br/><br/>This project will enhance basic understanding about the ways that climate change will affect agricultural land use and water resources under various policies and incentive structures.  Project results will facilitate early adaptation and make a timely contribution to the successful integration of agricultural, environmental, and trade policy.  Maps that will show where cropping patterns and associated agricultural revenues, water quantity, and water quality are most likely to change will be disseminated to the broad scientific community and relevant policy makers in USDA and other relevant governmental bodies.  Middle and high school teachers will be directly involved in developing teaching modules, distributable by CD/ROM and consistent with existing educational policies and practices, to bring building block concepts in systems and modeling approaches to nature-society interaction to Grade 6-12 science and Grade 9-12 social studies education.

The sounds of vocalizing and stridulating animals and the non-biological sounds of running water and rustling wind emanate from natural landscapes. In contrast, urban landscapes are dominated by human-produced sounds radiating from a variety of sources, such as machines, sirens, and friction generated by tires rotating over pavement.  Since Rachel Carson's seminal book, Silent Spring, nature's sounds have been inextricably linked to environmental quality. Because sound is a fundamental property of nature and can be drastically affected by a variety of human activities, sound provides a valuable perspective for examining the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems.  In recent years, ecologists, cognitive psychologists, and scholars in the humanities have begun to study soundscapes from their own natural, social, and creative disciplinary perspective.  Work in the U.S., Canada, and Europe is moving forward in these three camps with little to no coordination.  Even within the ecological community, no formal group has been formed that allows research to be integrated and compared.  To facilitate interaction among these communities of scholars and to invite scholars from other fields to examine sounds as measures of and perspectives into human and natural system interactions, this award will establish a research coordination network (RCN), the Global Sustainable Soundscape Network.  This RCN will bring together ecologists (landscape ecologists and conservation biologists), acoustic ecologists (from the creative arts) and acousticians and psychoacousticians (scientists that study sound and how people perceive sound) to coordinate studies of diverse soundscapes around the world.  The network will help to foster open communication among different disciplines about the composition of soundscapes and the underlying mechanisms that control dynamics and the ways that humans experience sounds in the environment through the support of workshops, sharing of tools, social networking, and activities of coordinated """"theme teams"""" that will address standards, interdisciplinary capacity building, sustainability, and conservation and engagement among other issues.  The RCN will coordinate activities across four or five soundscape monitoring sites where long-term acoustic data have been and will be collected.  The RCN will look to develop a common vocabulary, long-term monitoring standards, and metadata standards for acoustic data for use by researchers.  It will increase awareness of this new field among ecologists and social scientists through a variety of activities, and it will increase public awareness of the importance of people's acoustic connection to nature.  This RCN project also will impact education.  Four doctoral students will be supported as fellows to participate in workshops, and two workshops will conducted in coordination with conservation groups and natural resource management agencies.  Four undergraduate students will conduct soundscape research at host universities.<br/><br/>This research coordination network will stimulate new research on the role of sound as a measure of and perspective on the dynamic interactions among natural and human systems.  It will facilitate greater contact among scholars in different disciplines who are examining soundscapes, and it will encourage other researchers to become involved.  The RCN also will seek to broaden public awareness of soundscapes, and it will facilitate the involvement of researchers who are members of underrepresented minority groups by involving in leadership roles scholars from Tuskegee University and Alabama A&M University.

Lake Ontario embayments are representative of wetland?dominated coastal habitats around much of the Great Lakes and they are of great importance in the region. The embayments provide habitat for most Great Lakes aquatic species, change the quality of water entering the lakes, effect nutrient inputs to the open waters, support highly diverse and productive wetland vegetation, and provide very desirable locations for water?oriented human settlements.

Complexity results from movement-mediated linking of less complex spatial units by herbivores and humans into spatially extensive, complex systems. But modern human land use and land tenure systems tend to deplete spatial biocomplexity through fragmentation of ecosystems into isolated and simplified units. Ecosystem fragmentation is often justified as a means of economic intensification in the neo-classical framework, but in fact, it costs money to replace the natural capital lost through fragmentation. As a result of fragmentation, many of the world's arid and semi-arid grazed ecosystems are dysfunctional to varying degrees. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the importance of spatial complexity, the costs of fragmentation, and to identify options for sustainability at sites around the world by linking ecological and socio-economic research, and in the process, create an international network of scientists addressing these issues. The project focuses on 21 sites in nine countries on four continents. The interdisciplinary scientific team includes ecologists, anthropologists, economists, and political scientists. The project will include case study syntheses, field-based investigations, and model experiments and analyses.

An important example is public policy to control aquatic species invasions, which are often a major threat to native species and biodiversity, and consequently to the social value of aquatic ecosystems. This project investigates how policy interventions intended to control or prevent harmful aquatic species invasions affect the decisions and economic welfare of individuals using the aquatic system, and consequently the spatial dynamics of invasions. This question will be addressed for aquatic invasive species (AIS) now present in the lake district of northern Wisconsin, such as Eurasian water-milfoil, rusty crayfish, and zebra mussel. The analysis uses a variety of new data and methods, including an econometric model of boater behavior estimated with data from a two-year, web-based survey of boaters, novel experiments and analyses concerning propagule uptake by boats leaving infected lakes and propagule survival during transport, and a statistical model of the lake characteristics affecting propagule establishment and colonization. <br/><br/>As well as advancing understanding of aquatic species invasions, results will generally inform human-environment studies through the development of innovative models that incorporate uncertainties in human behaviors. On a practical level, the project will have broad impacts via its insights into basic management questions about AIS. For example, historically, management resources have been directed primarily towards invasive species control, possibly because of the political economy of invasions.

Typically these areas require active, sustained management intervention, usually in the form of restoration activities (e.g., removal of invasive species, use of prescribed fire), in order to realize the biodiversity conservation objectives set for them. Chicago Wilderness is a consortium of over 240 organizations that has as its primary goal the conservation, restoration and management of biodiversity on 360,000 acres of protected open space in the greater Chicago area. This research will use ongoing efforts in the woodlands and savannas of Chicago Wilderness as a model for investigating how the restoration and conservation planning process affects biodiversity outcomes in complex metropolitan landscapes. Several related research approaches will be utilized, including development of models to explore how interactions among different constituencies may lead to different restoration and management practices, and in turn, how these practices affect biodiversity outcomes. Documenting the range of biodiversity outcomes in woodland and savanna restoration sites across the Chicago region will permit a test of hypotheses about the relationship between distinct models of the restoration planning process (traditional, co-management, grassroots) and biodiversity. Thus, the project will research the impact of humans, via the planning process, on biodiversity in an urban context, and also the reciprocal influence of these biodiversity outcomes on different members of the human community.<br/><br/>The project will add to knowledge of the connections between conservation management planning and the biodiversity results that emerge from its implementation. The project will generate results relevant to the conservation of habitats of global significance (e.g. oak savanna, oak woodlands, and tallgrass prairie) while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of institutional responses to the challenges of balancing multiple objectives and incorporating heterogeneous sources of information into the planning process. The results will be broadly applicable to other complex metropolitan landscapes throughout the U.S. and the world.

Multifunctional agriculture is attracting considerable interest because it meets a range of social and ecological challenges to sustainability. This project will test a new model in which multifunctional agriculture is understood as a coupled human-environment system driven by ecosocial feedback, weak-tie social networks and multiple biophysical benefits. In this model, critical ecosocial feedback is mediated by 'weak ties' social networks, or those that bridge between groups. Weak tie networks allow the shared perception of biophysical signals as well as communication, resource exchange, and collective action by individuals and groups. Through weak-ties social networks, multifunctional agroecosystems that generate ecological benefits receive resources that increase their spatial extent, better signal these benefits, and increase the size and resource base of social networks. The project will test the hypothesis that this ecosocial feedback is strong enough to overcome systemic barriers to extensive adoption of an important emerging form of multifunctional agriculture, rotational grazing (RG). Work will occur in three states (NY, WI, MN) that differ markedly in development of RG. The project will examine individual and group behavior and social-network development , assess its biophysical effects, and use these findings to create an agent-based model of RG dynamics. Methods include digital mapping and remote sensing of social and ecological phenomena; biophysical research on terrestrial and aquatic systems at farm and landscape scales; social science interviews and structural equation modeling for farmer and network actors; and integrated modeling. Education and outreach for a variety of audiences include use of the model as a post-secondary educational game on ecosocial feedback, and working with grazing organizations to share the empirical results in a wide range of settings including conferences and strategic planning sessions. <br/><br/>Better understanding of dynamics of multifunctionality is important to society in several ways. In terms of theoretical advances, this research proposes a new model of feedback among social and ecological systems that could be applied not just to agriculture but also to many different kinds of productive systems that involve humans and the environment. In terms of practical outcomes, this project will help lower barriers to the expansion of grazing, which offers considerable potential for rural economic revitalization in many US regions, while also helping make the increasingly important US 'bioeconomy' more sustainable. The proposed research will help identify both opportunities and barriers affecting development of a sustainable bioeconomy based on multifunctional agriculture. Finally, the project helps a variety of different people learn about multifunctional agriculture in particular and human-environment interactions more broadly."

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies. At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact. This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system. This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation. Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems. This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.<br/><br/>The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives. A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic. Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i. Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture. The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies. The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i. School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting.

Current estimates suggest human activities have doubled the amount of biologically active nitrogen on a global basis, with agriculture accounting for 75 percent of the human-derived nitrogen. A complex set of environmental and socio-economic factors influence agricultural fertilizer management practices. Linkages among socioeconomic and ecological subsystems are recognized as crucial in efforts to pursue sustainable ecosystem management and improve nitrogen-use efficiency. Disconnections between human and natural subsystems must be addressed as well as disconnections within the component subsystems. Within the human realm, those who pollute do not pay the costs associated with resource degradation. Likewise, the biophysical system that has evolved as a result of high, input industrial agriculture is fraught with ecological disconnections. For example, uncoupling of carbon and nitrogen cycles is a defining trait of agricultural systems and is the root cause of the leakiness of these systems. On average, 45 percent to 55 percent of fertilizer nitrogen applied is lost to the environment. The goal of this research project is to understand how interactions among social and biophysical subsystems impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles in intensively managed agricultural landscapes at multiple scales. Specific objectives of the project are (1) to investigate how the human subsystem responds to the environmental consequences of carbon nitrogen uncoupling, (2) to evaluate the relationships between nitrogen leakiness, institutional capacity, and proximity to degraded aquatic resources, (3) to determine which policy changes are likely to be most effective in promoting more efficient nitrogen fertilizer-management practices, and (4) to model and simulate multi-scale interactions among policies, farm managers, and institutions as well as nitrogen losses across space and time. To understand how institutions respond to degradation of aquatic ecosystems, the investigators will compare the institutions and management approaches used in the Chesapeake Bay, where the negative impacts of excess nitrogen inputs are experienced more locally and by the farmers themselves, to those in the Midwest, where the negative impacts are much more remote. Research methods include field research, isotopic tracer studies, construction of mass balances at multiple scales, face-to-face interviews and surveys with stakeholders, geographical information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, systems modeling, and simulation.<br/><br/>This project has implications for coupled human-natural systems theory and methodology, social systems theory, and environmental policy. The theory of how the human and biophysical subsystems of managed landscapes is not well developed, particularly in the case of intensively managed, high-input agricultural systems. This research will enhance fundamental understanding of how social and ecosystem emergent properties mediate interactions among human and natural systems. In addition to using a synthetic interdisciplinary approach, the investigators will depart from a microeconomic model of social dynamics in which the aggregated behavior of individual actors is taken to represent social processes. They will focus primarily at the institutional level, where the social emergent properties govern the interactions between and social and natural subsystems. The project also will have practical outcomes of relevance to the development of agricultural and resource-management policy.

Research into how such coastlines evolve over spatial scales of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers and over time scales of decades and longer has just begun. Recent work has revealed surprising long-range interactions, with changes in one location directly affecting distant parts of the coastline. Human efforts to stabilize the shoreline position -- especially through artificial sand placement or """"beach nourishment"""" -- are becoming increasingly prevalent, and these localized manipulations likely affect how entire coastlines evolve through their long-range as well as regional effects. This research project will incorporate human manipulations into an enhanced computer model of large-scale, long-term coastline change caused by wave-driven sediment transport. Addressing the behaviors of the fully coupled human-natural system will require developing a model that represents how humans respond to coastline changes, especially local shoreline erosion. Such a model will be based on (1) data that incorporates historical beach-nourishment decisions and economic variables; (2) economic theory;( 3) information gathered during a workshop involving coastal managers, engineers, policy makers, and stakeholders; and (4) scenarios of federal beach-nourishment subsidies, future expense of procuring beach-quality sand, and policy constraints arising from ecological concerns. The resulting coupled model will allow investigations of the types of coastline behaviors to be expected in coming decades and centuries in the context of likely climate change and the consequent changes in storm and wave patterns as well as accelerated sea-level-rise. The coastline of the Carolinas will be used as an initial case study to test the model.<br/><br/>Developing the social science component of the modeling endeavor will involve the first examination of how beach nourishment decisions are made. Experiments using the coupled human-coastline model will provide the first examination of how human-influenced coastlines evolve, and more specifically, how actions taken at one location are likely to affect other coastal communities in far-flung locations as well as nearby. The potential insights gained through this work could help coastal managers and planners avoid surprises arising from such spillover effects, which could be especially important as climate change and direct human manipulations become more important factors affecting coastline change. A dedicated website and targeted communications will facilitate dissemination of the main lessons to interested coastal planners and stakeholders. More broadly, this research will advance the embryonic science of human-landscape interactions, which are becoming ubiquitous across much of the Earth's surface.

The project draws upon social and ecological theories of spatial heterogeneity in cities in order to understand how urban development leads to economic, social, and physical inequalities among neighborhoods, which in turn produce neighborhood differences in microclimate conditions. Microclimate conditions influence the biotic environment, which then completes the cycle by influencing the socioeconomic and physical systems of neighborhoods. Because neighborhoods have unequal resources for responding to climate stress, socioeconomic status of the neighborhood and other local characteristics will moderate the effects of this process. The research has three specific objectives. First, the project will show how the settlement of neighborhoods between 1970 and 2000 transformed the landscape by altering land use, land cover, and climate. Second, the project will demonstrate whether and to what extent the resulting differences among neighborhood microclimates expose humans and other biota to unequal levels of climate-induced stressors, such as heat, poor air quality, and storm hazards. Third, the project will investigate the resilience of human and plant communities in neighborhoods that have unequal amounts of capital to cope with climate stress. The research sites are seven Phoenix neighborhoods located at monitoring sites of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research project. The neighborhoods, bounded by census block groups, include cases that vary by age, distance to urban center, land cover, income, and ethnic composition. The project will use data from a wide variety of sources, including the census, social surveys of residents, historical land-use surveys and climate records, field measures of environmental conditions, and remotely sensed images of land cover and temperature. GIS mapping, graphing tools, spatial statistics, and multivariate statistical analysis will be used to develop indicators of human, ecosystem, and climate activities and changes over time using. Using key indicators, neighborhood socioecological cycles will be compared for places that differ by social class, physical features, and distance from the urban center. Research results will be disseminated through publications in several disciplines and presentations at professional meetings.<br/><br/>Research on urban development in arid regions will contribute to understanding the regional dimensions of global climate change. This project will advance the development of integrative theory in the social and ecological sciences by explaining how human actions influence climate change at the neighborhood scale. This is a necessary link between fine-scale ecosystem processes, such as variation in neighborhood microclimates, and coarse-scale environmental phenomena, such as global warming. The research will help improve models of urban growth and models of regional climate change. The project also informs human vulnerability theory, which explains how social inequalities expose poor people to higher risks of environmental hazards. While many studies of vulnerability focus on """"natural"""" disasters that are more likely to harm poor people, this project will study chronic environmental conditions, specifically climatic variability and change, which poses a more lasting but less obvious threat to vulnerable populations.

The research employs agent-based simulation to examine various models for how farmers locate themselves and use resources on this landscape. Further, the simulation will examine the exchange of agricultural goods among households, and whether exchange causes households to aggregate into villages in certain times and places, and disperse into smaller settlements during other times. Finally, the simulation will examine why this area is depopulated in the late A.D. 1200s. Households in this model act in a virtual environment where the elevation, soil type, temperature, vegetation, potential agricultural production, and precipitation vary over an 1800-sq-km study area. The simulation is possible because high-resolution archaeological and environmental records are available for the study area during this period, including an inventory of thousands of archaeological sites, tree-ring records, and estimates of available surface water and ground water. Estimates of agricultural production change annually according to climatic inputs reconstructed from tree-ring records, and possibly in response to landscape degradation due to farming as well. Over longer periods, the same factors affect the availability of surface water and ground water, and changes in the location and availability of water will also be incorporated into the simulation. Population size and the location of settlement on the landscape vary according to the experiences of the households during the period under investigation, and population flows from and to other areas. The simulation will employ cultural algorithms (variants of genetic algorithms) through which households may optimize their landscape and resource use with respect to other households with whom they exchange corn and compete for agricultural land. These algorithms will also be used to simulate selection of farming strategies, including those that use surface water for irrigation. In this way, the simulation will be used to determine how exchange of agricultural goods, competition for land, and changing farming strategies affected household movement and formation of villages. The behavior of households in all variants of the simulation will be compared against a database for archaeological sites in the study area that specifies their location, size, function, and period of occupation, allowing an assessment of how well each variant fits the archaeological record. <br/><br/>This work contributes to understanding changing land-use strategies in small-scale farming societies experiencing significant climate change and population growth.

In addition, the research will develop tools to make the future examination of such systems more effective. The groundwater model will help to predict what might happen to groundwater supplies in this area as climate changes in the future.

Capabilities to understand and influence tropical biodiversity depend in large part on basic understanding of actively managed landscapes. Because pastures cover most agricultural lands in the neotropics of Central and South America, significant changes in their biodiversity, such as the emergence of more trees, represent a potentially important development. The numbers of trees in pastures in the Ecuadorian Amazon basin appear to have increased during the past two decades. These silvopastoral landscapes have emerged spontaneously, without efforts by people to create them. This interdisciplinary research project will investigate the ecological and human correlates of this change. Proximity to forest remnants, soil quality, and species characteristics play important roles in the spread of trees in pastures, with management practices also appearing to be important. Through intensive study of pastures with variable numbers of trees, the investigators will examine how seed rain, soil fertility, tree species, and foraging influence the spread of trees in pastures as well as how biodiversity, carbon storage, and biogeochemical cycling change with more trees in pastures. Through interviews with owners of the pastures, the investigators will assess the hypothesis that small farmers intent on economic diversification tolerate more trees in pastures because they do not have the labor to do otherwise. Small farmers do not abandon cattle ranching because income from cattle is too important to forego, but because they now have non-farm pursuits, they do not have time to """"clean"""" pastures of seedlings as thoroughly as they did when they worked full time with cattle. Because middle-aged men have left home to work elsewhere, female household heads now manage more pastures, and they face these dilemmas in an acute way. Without resident males or full titles to land, women worry about land invasions, so they maintain a """"presence"""" on the land by grazing cattle on it. At the same time, women combine child care with needlework at home to earn a livelihood, so they do not have time to clean pastures of seedlings. Once established, the trees create micro-environments that allow other trees to sprout. The investigators will evaluate these hypotheses with evidence from ecological inventories of pastures, interviews with farmers, aerial photos, and satellite images of 90 cattle ranches in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Using data and information from these sources, they will build a model in which social and ecological changes generate spontaneous silvopastoral landscapes.<br/><br/>A spontaneous path to silvopastoral landscapes has emerged in a large, formerly forested area of the neotropics. This """"natural"""" history may have important implications for the long-standing but relatively unsuccessful efforts to promote silvopastoral landscapes. In a context in which politicians consider paying for environmental services as part of a larger, international effort to sequester carbon in tropical forests, research that outlines how small farmers are sequestering carbon in shaded pastures can demonstrate how to expedite this landscape change and benefit poor farmers.

The model will have both practical and theoretical significance. By exploring how a stable but brittle regional system collapsed through a series of subtle multiple and reinforcing discontinuities, and by simulating the response of that system under different decision-making and reorganization scenarios, the model will advance understanding of resilience dynamics in coupled social-ecological systems. It also will provide a solid, practical foundation for expanding dialogue among diverse stakeholders, develop additional modeling and outreach efforts, and build capacity for regional problem-solving. Insights and understanding derived from this model may prove valuable to agro-ecosystems in other regions facing similar challenges that have not yet experienced large-scale collapse.

Not surprisingly, science and technology policy has become widely separated from the scholarship within science and about science, so that policy often follows the piecemeal opportunism of funding opportunities.  The result is loss of consideration of the broader context and goals, and a failure to consider who wins, who loses, and why that matters.  There is a basic need to consider, in particular, what should count as appropriate expertise, morality, and politics relating to science and technology policy.   <br/>  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Science and Technology Policy provides an opportunity to develop that discussion, and to do so in a new community of scholars and practitioners who do not normally interact.  Therefore, this proposal seeks funding for participants to attend the GRC on Science and Technology Policy in August 2004.  The Conference will follow the GRC tradition of providing an international forum for presentation and discussion of frontier research in the biological, chemical, and physical sciences, and their related technologies, in this case focusing on policy.  <br/>  With this conference, there is the opportunity to bring together academics in the social and behavioral science, historians, philosophers, ethicists, and others whose research explores science and technology policy in diverse ways, alongside professionals (including scientists) involved in making, implementing, and promoting policy.  Though acknowledging the usual basic-applied or theoretical-activist distinctions as problematic, the proposal seeks to bring together a full range of participants, from the most basic or theoretical academic ends of a spectrum to those directly engaged in advocacy and action in the policy community. It seeks to promote systematic understanding of the character and development of science and technology policy, including cultural, intellectual, material, and social dimensions (much as NSF seeks to do with Criterion 2).  <br/>Out of this process should grow a multidisciplinary network of participants whose own thinking, research, and actions are influenced by their participation.  The goal is therefore twofold: to enhance the perspectives of each participant, and also to create a sustainable community of individuals with growing respect and understanding of each others' languages, interests, and values.  If successful, the project will also be sowing seeds for a new kind of expertise among academics in the sciences, social sciences, ethics, and/or history and philosophy of science through their interactions with those setting, analyzing, and promoting policy by creating a new network able to communicate and work together to enhance everyone's thinking, research, and action into the future.   <br/>  Success will depend on persuading a dynamic group of outstanding thinkers to give up five full days of their precious summer research time and share the intense interaction and resulting communication and network-building. Getting the best people to attend requires funding.  Therefore, on behalf of the entire Gordon Conference, the proposal seeks funding for Conference participants.  All funds will be used for direct costs for those involved as speakers, discussants, planners, and poster presenters.   <br/>  <br/>"

Their comparative simplicity makes agroecosystems much less nutrient conservative than their natural counterparts.  Furthermore, agroecosystems are a major source of nutrient loading and subsequent loss of biodiversity to aquatic systems worldwide.  While complexity in agroecosystems often is low biophysically, these systems are much more complex when the human socio-economic systems are included.  Ultimately it is this complex system of human values, beliefs, and social constructs, including economics, that determine the ecological structure and function of agroecosystems.  Efforts to restore ecological function to agricultural landscapes will be successful only if they include both the human and biophysical dimensions of these systems.  During the past three years, a multidisciplinary team of ecological and social scientists has been developing a framework and approach to agroecosystem restoration that integrates both natural and social capital required for effective restoration of ecological function to the Sugar Creek Watershed in northeast Ohio.  The objectives of this research planning grant are: (1) to benchmark the social, physical, and ecological features of the headwater tributaries that most directly relate to understanding the linkages between managed terrestrial and aquatic systems; (2) to create increased awareness of watershed ecology, and motivate farmers to use, and others to encourage the use of agricultural practices that improve water quality, and (3) to restore biodiversity and ecosystem function on a tributary by tributary basis of whole landscapes including both agricultural and non-agricultural areas.  The planning process will focus on bringing in additional investigators with expertise in key areas, developing the necessary experiments and data sets on which to build plans for a fuller project, and expanding an education component that ultimately will integrate student participation into the project and further link researchers, farmers, and students in a learning process.<br/><br/>Increasing biocomplexity from microbial to human interaction scales in primary headwater watersheds will enhance the social and economic sustainability of agroecosystems and will decrease agriculture's ecological impact.  Only by integrating the social dynamics among neighboring farmers as a community will the ecological compatibility between terrestrial and aquatic systems be improved.  In the long-term, the investigators expect to evaluate the impact of restored and unrestored headwaters on downstream areas through permanent monitoring stations.  They also expect to use the data from these on-site experiments to model impacts at sub-basin and overall watershed levels.  The restorations examined through this project will serve as a primary focal point for developing the research framework and team-building efforts. Longer-term educational efforts include training for elementary and secondary school teachers.  Farmers from the Sugar Creek watershed will present case studies on agriculture and their restoration efforts to school and other lay audiences.  Future emphasis will be on using ecological processes as management strategies at field, farm, and community/subwatershed scales.

In recent years, a number of projects have systematically sought to gather socioeconomic data at the household level as well as remotely sensed land-use and land-cover data.  These projects generally have been independent of each other, and there has not been a careful review of the methods being used to actually link data on people and pixels (the units of land as viewed by the remote sensors).  This Biocomplexity Incubation Award will support the conduct of a workshop to address both theoretical and practical issues involved in collecting and linking socioeconomic data from households and communities with remotely sensed data to study land-use and land-cover change.  This project will bring scientists from a number of these major projects discuss the methods, challenges, and opportunities currently facing researchers.  The workshop is expected to be held at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, in mid- to late 2001.  Papers prepared by and discussions among participants at the workshop will be used to produce a publication that provides a state-of-the-art survey of methodology and issues for linking household-based socioeconomic data with remotely sensed land-use and land-cover data.  This project is designed not only to enhance the knowledge of the scientific community regarding the interaction between human and natural systems.  It also will provide decision makers with information and tools to enable them to better understand human impacts on land-use and land-cover change and to predict environmental responses to such changes.  Understanding these processes is critical if policy makers and planners are to create the conditions that promote environmentally sound and sustainable development.  More specifically, the proposed workshop will lead to a better understanding of methods of analyzing human impacts on land-use changes and of how these changes influence land cover over time.<br/>"

Land management inside the park and development of the winter range outside park boundaries suggests that wildlife management plays out on a landscape mosaic dominated by human decisions, values, and economic considerations.  The main objectives of this research project are to gain a better understanding of the relationships between ecosystem dynamics and human decision-making and to use this understanding to construct an ecosystem model that facilitates exploration of plausible future scenarios in a manner that captures the uncertainty associated with complex systems.  An investigative team drawn from multiple disciplines and from five different states will develop spatially explicit elk, wolf, and vegetation submodels and will integrate these models to assess the impacts of climate variability, land-use decisions, and economic valuation on the environment under changing conditions.  The elk submodel will extend state-of-the-science energetics-based models to include information on changing landscapes and climate/snow conditions that affect winter feeding habits.  The investigators will develop predator components that mimic the impacts of the recent wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone.  The snow/climate submodel will be developed to produce snow depth and snow condition maps based on local and large-scale climate parameters and field measurements.  Vegetation submodels will focus on willows and aspen, plants that often are browsed heavily by elk.  The investigators will address the impacts of changing groundwater resources on these species to better understand their resilience to the combined impacts of elk browse and groundwater stress.  Because elk, vegetation, and other factors have become measures by which humans place values on the landscape that influence decisions, stakeholder groups will be studied and interviewed to assure that the resulting models have relevance in the socio-political context of the NEWR.  This is particularly important, because stakeholders have a long history of conflict regarding land-use decisions.  This project will develop a land-use history, define key stakeholder-identified variables, and use probability-based land-use models.  Knowledge derived from stakeholder studies will be integrated into the natural system models as coefficients of habitat availability and quality; as parameters on barriers, sources and sinks; as qualitative and categorical constraints on modeled variables and relationships; and as feedback loops between the human and natural system.  The natural and human system submodels will be combined within the context of a single multi-agent system that can model complex adaptive systems.  The multi-agent system-based model will be used to simulate alternative states that result from assumptions about decisions, natural conditions, and ecosystem processes.  The results will demonstrate the complex nature of a highly integrated ecosystem and the role that climate, human decisions, and natural variability play in producing ecosystem change and/or stability. <br/><br/>This research will merge models of ecosystems and human decision-making.  A primary focus is to build robust ecosystem models that can be integrated with a human system model based on land use decisions and valuation of ecosystem services.  By interacting with NEWR stakeholders and by developing key linkages within natural and human systems, this project will evaluate existing and potential land-use strategies and alternative policy options.  The models will demonstrate the complex interactions that exist within this changing landscape by simulating climate factors, policy decisions, and natural change in the vegetation.  Models will be extended to simulate potential future conditions based on sound scientific principles, past trends in human decision making, and possible future human decisions.  Scenarios may be used to help build consensus and diminish conflict in the NEWR before decisions are made.  The NEWR is a critical component of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and understanding the complexity associated with human and natural system dynamics will help sustain the area for future generations.  This project will serve as a model for protected areas worldwide that are undergoing similar boundary conflicts.

The most important feedbacks are those related to the spatial structure of the system.  In this interdisciplinary research project, the researchers will investigate how feedbacks at a frontier of human settlement in the Ecuadorian tropical rainforest create system dynamics that constrain the future trajectories of human settlement.  The tropical rainforest of northeastern Ecuador is an area of complex interactions among a number of diverse stakeholders:(a) spontaneous colonists who have in-migrated from other regions of the country and settled on household farms; (b) newly emerging communities and market centers that have consolidated services and offer off-farm employment to colonists; (c) indigenous people who are affected by the rise of commercial agriculture, oil production within their territories, and a transition to a consumer-based economy; (d) oil exploiters who have built roads and laid pipelines for petroleum extraction in colonist and indigenous areas; and (e) conservation and protected areas established to impeded development and retain biodiversity in a rapidly transforming frontier environment.  The most extensive changes on the land are those wrought by agricultural colonists who migrated to the region in the wake of oil exploration, settling along roads built by oil companies starting around 1970.  Interrelationships with the other stakeholders in the region are complex, resulting from different, often conflicting, interests and feedbacks between spatial patterns and rates of change on the advancing frontier environment.  Feedbacks constrain or even reverse some of the original changes in LULCC through system dynamics.  Properties emerging from local non-linear feedbacks constrain the evolving patterns of land use and produce a system with identifiable potential future alternative states and dynamics characterized by phase changes.<br/><br/>Land-use and land-cover change is reshaping the Earth's biosphere and altering species habitats.  As a result LULCC has significant implication for the vulnerability and sustainability of earth systems.  Human-environment systems have characteristic cyclic dynamics that are linked in a hierarchy to faster and slower cycles.  The cycles that change a system are often those in which feedbacks cross scales.  The LULCC dynamics on which people depend may be subject to rapid changes and shifts to situations that cannot support growing populations and their activities.  The characteristics of systems that determine their responses in such conditions are summarized as resilience.  The use of complexity theory to analyze LULCC system dynamics on an ecologically vital frontier will yield better understand its resilience and its future.  An integrated simulation modeling approach that draws upon collected ethnographic data and a household and community survey will serve as a focused statistical base to create rules for an agent based model (ABM) that will represent the land use decision making of the key actors, and will provide parameters that simulate LULCC in the past and for future periods.

The development of policies and other solutions for minimizing negative ecological effects and introducing possible positive ecological effects of land-use change requires tools for anticipating and evaluating the complex interactions between humans and ecological systems.  To have some predictive power, these tools should characterize the nature of land-use decision making at the levels of individual households, firms, and local governments, and they should permit evaluation of the ecological effects of various decisions.  Such tools should recognize economic, political, and psychological motivations for land-use and management decisions on the urban fringe as well as utilities for sale of undeveloped land.

Energy use, agricultural practices, and demographics are entwined with the desire of people to improve their well-being and to manage economic growth and its effects through well-meaning but sometimes misdirected policies.  The goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to evaluate fundamental interactions between human and terrestrial systems through agriculture and land use, both of which are impacted by forces that are global in nature and moderated by climate and atmospheric composition.  The approach that will be used to model these interactions entails use of complex but separate models of human activity, the atmosphere and ocean, terrestrial systems, and sector-by-sector models of economic and human effects.  The researchers plan to develop the dynamic linkages needed between a complex global model of the economy and a complex model of terrestrial systems to evaluate these costs and potential feedbacks of changes in atmospheric composition and climate.  The proposed work is to link the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, and the Terrestrial Ecosystems Model (TEM) to dynamically simulate changes in crop productivity driven by environmental change and the economic consequences and changes in land use driven by changes in trade in agriculture and the price of agricultural goods.  The work will take advantage of existing capabilities of the two models with some additional improvements needed to make the linkages between them.  Principally, this involves further disaggregating the agricultural sector of EPPA and linking the economic data to a supplemental data set on physical land use being developed at the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) at Purdue University.  The project also will involve the development of a mosaic approach in the TEM to represent the regions and land uses represented in EPPA.  These developments will allow simulation studies of the dynamic linkages among terrestrial systems, land use, the economy, international trade, and economic policy as affected by such changes in climate and atmospheric composition as increasing levels of carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone.<br/><br/>This project will constitute a first attempt to study complex interactions between terrestrial systems and the economy in a fully coupled model at the global scale.

We will develop agent-based models to examine how land-use decisions made at one level (a household) affect outcomes at that level and at several higher and lower levels in a hierarchically nested set of systems.  We develop two agent-based models to explain land-use patterns in the frontier and post-frontier Midwest of the United States and the frontier of the Brazilian Amazon.  The first model will address two major puzzles: (1) Why did the descendants of the initial settlers in nineteenth-century Indiana cut down timber at such a massive and seemingly uneconomic rate that they eventually denuded the land, causing massive erosion and soil loss, and leading to substantial farm abandonment? and (2) Why have forests regrown so extensively on privately owned land when so many public policies are based on the assumption that fragmented, privately owned parcels are destined never to have significant forest regrowth?  The second model will explain the spatial and temporal patterns of deforestation in the Amazon over the last three decades.  The assumptions we make in the two models will be empirically tested and grounded by rigorous laboratory experiments.  The patterns of land use at any point in time and the processes of change also will be tested against a rich set of data derived from ground-truthed satellite data, aerial photographs, land surveys, census data, household interviews, forest mensuration undertaken in a sample of forest patches, and archival data regarding timber and agricultural prices, input costs, and land values.  After further development and testing, both models will be used to extrapolate into the future and assess how diverse public policies are likely to affect land use in general and forest change in particular in these regions.  The project will involve three important capstone activities: a Workshop on Agent-Based Models of Biocomplexity, a synthesis volume to be derived from the Workshop, and a Summer Institute.<br/><br/>The study will have multiple impacts.  By achieving an empirically validated understanding of land-use decisions of individual households under different policy regimes, the study will produce useful tools for evaluating alternative public policies.  Ascertaining how public inducements, taxation, and constraints affect rates of forest change contributes to the worldwide effort to find effective methods for stimulating reforestation and thereby sequestering carbon to offset carbon released into the atmosphere.  The study also addresses fundamental questions related to the appropriate model of human behavior to use when examining a combination of investment decisions in complex, dynamic environments.  Thus, the study is relevant for achieving an empirically validated foundation for an array of decision situations beyond those of land use and deforestation.  Tools from multiple social, biological, and physical science disciplines will be combined and expanded in unique ways and disseminated in publications, workshops, and training institutes.

Seasonal tropical forest biomes require special attention because of the amount of deforestation taking place in them.  Since 1997, a large, interdisciplinary project has been developing data and analysis to understand the human and biophysical dynamics of deforestation, and to model and project land changes in the southern Yucatan, which includes the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve.  The understanding gained is being used to develop insights about the vulnerability and resilience of coupled land uses and land covers in the region, ultimately building towards a full-blown vulnerability study.  The project seeks to identify some of the critical factors linked to sustained human disturbance and increasing aridity (climate change) on the land systems.  It will complete extant work on an extremely detailed forest-land cover classification and its accuracy assessment, and it will bring help make that work current into 2004, via ASTER imagery.  The project will establish an AVHRR archive that will ultimately address the question:  Have Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measurements decreased among the extant mature forests, and is this linked to increased aridity?  The study will also use existing data and modest levels of new data to compare the litter between mature forests and successional forest and examine the impact of land history on biomass accumulation.  A carbon stock estimate for the region will be generated using extant tree measurements as well as litter and soil carbon data.  Several biodiversity data sets (transect captures) will be completed in order to address the question of biodiversity loss linked to habitat change from deforestation.  Finally, a survey of farmer's responses to the recent hurricane Isidore will be completed to determine how differently endowed households respond to hurricane disturbances.<br/><br/>The Southern Yucatan Peninsular Region (SYPR) project on which this study builds has laid out one of the most comprehensive assessments of land change undertaken anywhere, linking biophysical and human subsystem dynamics into several different kinds of models that explain and project land change.  In this sense, it provides methodological and analytical advances for emerging land-change science by linking the natural, social, and spatial sciences.  Land-change science now moves toward questions of system response to perturbations and stresses, such as climate change.  The SYPR project has the capacity to take a leadership role in this effort as well.  This research will begin the transition of the project to questions of vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability of land systems in one of the most important seasonal tropical forests remaining in the Americas.  It begins to provide the answers to the question:  How will forest types and land-uses respond to a more occupied, frequently used (cut and burned) landscape that is subject to climate change?  The answers are important for the many people who call the region home as well as to the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve situated in the center of the region and pivotal the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.  Research results will have more general utility for scholars and practitioners working in many other parts of the world, too.<br/>"

Decisions regarding the use of agricultural land have significant economic and environmental consequences.  While these decisions are focused mainly upon the production of food and fiber, agricultural landscapes and watersheds also have the potential to produce enhanced flows of ecosystem services (such as nutrient cycling, regulation of atmospheric gases, soil formation, and wildlife habitat) through investments in natural capital like wetland restoration, riparian filter strips, and changes in farming methods that increase soil organic carbon.  Unfortunately, there is a narrow range of socioeconomic circumstances under which resource managers are willing to make substantial private investments in the present to achieve more substantial public environmental benefits through enhanced flows of ecosystem services in the future.  This interdisciplinary research project will investigate solutions to this socio-environmental dilemma by constructing a spatial decision-support system called Virtual Watershed.  Virtual Watershed will combine environmental simulation models, geographic information systems, evolutionary algorithms, and agent-based modeling to capture the dynamic nonlinear interactions among economic and ecological conditions, public policies, land and water managers' behavior, and other variables that generate rural landscape patterns.  These patterns in turn determine ecological and economic performance at a watershed scale. Issues of particular interest are the complex nature of landscape change over time and the capability of adaptive management processes to guide landscape change to meet user-defined social goals in an evolving environmental and social system.  Case studies in two watersheds (one in Illinois and the other in Quebec) will examine whether landscape change displays self-organized complexity as captured in the concept of """"panarchy,"""" a concept associated with the idea that human-environment systems have characteristic cyclic dynamics that are linked in a hierarchy to faster and slower cycles<br/><br/>This project has clear and direct applications in environmental and agricultural policy.  One primary hypothesis is that the environmental performance of agricultural landscapes can be markedly improved while not reducing income to land managers through changes in incentive structures.  Such incentive structures include among others, forms of agricultural subsidization, land retirement programs, and cost sharing for practices adoption.  Additionally, improvement can occur though the responses of land managers to other stimuli, such as neighboring land uses and neighbors' adoption of new practices.  The project will further test the hypothesis that an adaptive management process that first simulates near theoretically optimal landscape performance and then is used to adjust the decision environments of land managers to guide them toward that optimum can result in improved ecological-economic performance over time.  This occurs despite disturbance events and changing social preferences that have the potential to turn this adaptive management process into a treadmill of change without improvement rather than a path toward ecological-economic improvement.  In testing these hypotheses, the project will achieve a better understanding of the independent and interdependent roles of economic conditions and incentives, environmental policies, resource manager behavior, and pre-existing landscape patterns on the dynamics of landscape change as well as trade-offs and complementarities among economic and ecological goals for agricultural watersheds.  The visually improved Virtual Watershed model will be valuable in educational and policy-making settings.

This research project will model and attempt to explain trajectories of development and demise of Bronze Age settlement systems for both the rain-fed and the irrigated zones of modern-day Syria and Iraq.  The project goals are to develop a holistic, dynamic, object-based model that can help determine the conditions under which societies became more or less urban or even collapsed.  The investigators will examine why third and fourth millennium B.C. cities in the irrigated zone of southern Mesopotamia grew to a greater size and complexity than those in the rain-fed north.  Traditional models often view cities as being founded by an over-arching authority.  Although the model will test such a top-down perspective, the project will emphasize settlement system development from the ground up.  Concepts of complex adaptive systems will be used to test the hypothesis that systems of early cities and their regions co-evolved in an intimate relationship with their environment, primarily by means of aggregation through time of smaller fundamental units (households).  Agent-based modeling will allow a wide range of choices and trajectories to contribute to the outcome of the modeling exercise.  Simulation will employ advanced object-based frameworks (DIAS and FACET) designed by the Decision and Information Sciences Division of Argonne National Laboratory.  The DIAS framework allows a range of simulation models and other applications to work together to address a complex modeling problem.  It will incorporate climate (GCM), weather (MM5), hydrological and agricultural (EPIC / SWAT), and demographic models plus agent-based models of social behavior built using the FACET framework.  Input data will be derived from the large corpus of landscape data, epigraphic data, and regional-scale environmental studies housed within the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and elsewhere.  The simulated settlement system will be validated against the archaeological landscape as it has been recorded by field surveys and satellite remote sensing.  By the end of the project, investigators expect to have developed a general modeling framework with an associated user interface that will enable interactions between humans and the environment to be rigorously tested over periods as long as several millennia.<br/><br/>The expected result of this work, improved understanding how humans interact with dynamic ecological and climatic mechanisms, is fundamental to ecological management and is applicable very broadly.  In addition, studies of the interplay of coupled human and natural systems as a cause of collapse of past societies are also of fundamental importance.  Cities and their hinterlands are among the most complex coupled natural and human systems, and urban systems will continue to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of the planet.  This project will provide new insights into the complex interactions between people and their environment, and it will contribute to the study of urbanization past and present.  The proposed modeling framework also has potential utility as an educational tool, because it will enable both academic and general users to interact with complex environmental, cultural, and socio-economic databases in order to simulate the growth of settlements and cities and to analyze long term concepts of sustainability.

Even """"simple"""" hunting and gathering peoples travel over considerable distances to exploit diverse habitats and trade with other societies. The organization of human activity is therefore one way that nutrients, energy, and non-human species are redistributed, and different human cultures represent different patterns of resource redistribution. Because humans have been part of most ecosystems for a long time, most ecosystems that regarded today as """"pristine"""" or """"natural"""" are, to some degree, artifacts of human cultures. The research development project focuses on the role of indigenous Pacific Northwest Coast Salish cultures in the pre-industrial structure of Salish Sea (Puget Sound-Georgia Strait) ecosystems, with special emphasis placed on exploring the extent to which Coast Salish peoples provided connectivity between different terrestrial and marine habitats. As an early part of what is anticipated to be a much wider-ranging inquiry that explored between 75 and 100 sites in the archipelago of islands dispersed across Puget Sound and Georgia Strait, the project will glean evidence of a single human-ecological process (the impact of burning in upland areas in ways that had ecologically significant, relevant effects on nearshore marine habitats) from one site in the San Juan Islands that offers a record at least 500 years long. A team of young investigators working with both Native and non-Native students will conduct field work to ascertain late prehistoric fire regime in the study site watershed, reproduce and evaluate stuydy site's prehistoric fire regime, and seek to confirm fire regime effects from sediment paleofauna. The work will rely on a range of archaeological and paleoenvironmental research techniques, including habitat mapping, examination of witness trees, analysis of sediment and shell-midden cores, and test-plot burning.<br/><br/>Although anticipated to be only an early step in a long-duration research program that will expand to examine other sites and other forms of human-natural system interaction, this developmental project still should provide some significant new information and perspectives. The project is expected to provide a rigorous test of a hypothesis relating to the prehistoric human effects on aquatic environments. It also should test and refine a suite of tools for exploring prehistoric human-related fire as well as other prehistoric resource-management regimes. In terms of broader impacts, the project should initiate efforts to assemble a large collection of dated faunal remains and sediments from cultural and natural deposits, thereby preserving paleoecological data that otherwise would be lost. Reconstructing the long-term resilience of Puget Sound marine ecosystems to human and geophysical (climate, sea level, seismic) impacts is expected to strengthen science-based predictive capabilities for decision making in the basin, where extremely costly measures have been launched to defend vulnerable or endangered species such as Pacific salmon stocks and where efforts are currently underway to establish an international marine protected area. The project also should build long-term research relationships among U.S. and Canadian universities and marine-dependent Native American communities, and it should recruit a corps of Native and non-Native science students to collaborate in its design and evolve into a culturally diverse multidisciplinary team.

The project will involve two workshops. Each workshop will run for three to five days and will involve 30 to 45 participants; including roughly equal numbers of ecologists and social scientists. The first workshop will center on the construction of preliminary models and the exploration of issues that have to be resolved in order to integrate the insights and working methods of ecology and social science. Preliminary models will be developed and tested over the following year in a sequence of graduate seminars. Web-based materials will be developed to maintain contact among the participants.

Despite their differences in research traditions, these two fields have reached a stage where intensive interactions in a series of workshops should be very fruitful. Both groups have been heavily concerned with the destruction or transformation of habitat, a set of processes that probably pose the greatest threat to biodiversity. Both groups have also addressed these processes in ways that make spatial processes explicit and important. Among ecologists, space has become an extremely important component in the logic of theoretical models of ecological processes. Among social scientists, spatial frameworks have become crucial as basis for gathering and organizing information about environmental change.

Usually poor in biodiversity, they display most other characteristics of complex systems, including feedback loops, step functions and other nonlinearities, surprises, and unpredictability. The most complex human-managed system is the modern city of the developed world. Its complexity may well be of benefit to the environment; more complex cities may prove to be even more benign. The rapidly growing cities of the developing world, in contrast, are often insufficiently complex, lacking even basic elements of infrastructure such as water and sewage systems. Their vulnerability as forms of human organization and the vulnerability of their residents to poor quality of life, disease, and death are often extremely high, and are likely to be severely tested by environmental changes at the local, regional, and global levels. This Biocomplexity Incubation Activity award will support work in association with the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP) to develop an international, interdisciplinary research project under the auspices of the IHDP-Industrial Transformations core research program. That project will address the issue of whether and how it would be possible to decouple the improvement of human well-being from the negative environmental effects of the production and consumption systems that sustain life in cities. Noting that humankind is now a majority urban species and will be even more so within 50 years, the project will focus on the form of human social organization that will probably have the greatest impact on the environment at local, regional, and global scales throughout the next century. It will design an implementation plan for interdisciplinary research on cities as complex systems, drawing upon insights from other disciplines about forms of biocomplexity. It will give special attention to urbanization in the developing world, where most of the world's megacities are now being built, and particularly to the Asia-Pacific region, because of the rapid rates of urbanization in countries of the region and the large population size of many countries in the region. The project will initially focus on two subsystems through which humans have large effects upon their environments: the subsystem by which humans utilize water, affect the hydrological cycle, and produce pollution of various forms, and the subsystem by which humans achieve mobility of goods and persons, usually consuming substantial amounts of energy in the process and emitting several forms of environmentally active substances. Each subsystem may contain tractable solutions to the problem of combining the improvement of human well being with the reduction of human impacts on the environment. The incubation project will provide for capacity building through workshops, small seed grants, international collaboration, and the production of an implementation plan.

The project will collect new information on known archaeological sites, and conduct a study of resource availability and use to model the evolution of economic strategies among households and larger groups.  Model simulations will be used to explore processes leading to group-formation. This includes identifying communities in the archaeological record, evolving them in simulation models, and allowing them to compete and cooperate with other groups. <br/><br/>This work contributes to understanding several near-universal processes in societies undergoing population growth and economic intensification following the development of new technologies.  Equally important is the enhanced understanding it will provide of the rich archaeological records of Mesa Verde and Rio Grande regions, which together are visited by close to a million people each year.  The research team is highly interdisciplinary and includes archaeologists, a geochemist, a computer scientist, an ecologist/geographer, a specialist in ancient DNA, and an economist.  Researchers from the two national parks, the Santa Fe National Forest, and major museums are an integral part of the team.  Collaborating institutions will involve undergraduate and graduate students and the public in research activities.

However, the region is subject to frequent droughts and considerable year-to-year uncertainty in availability of both fodder and surface water for cattle. Many small lakes in the region appear during the wet season but dry out during the dry season and, over millennia, human societies in the region responded to the seasonal availability of water for cattle by developing complex, socially-negotiated, long-distance herd-migration routes that organized and formalized access to the grazing resources of the Sahel. Since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s the coupled hydrology and socioeconomic organization of the Sahel appears to be changing, with increasing drainage into pools that in some places now provide year-round water for cattle.  This project will test the hypothesis that these system level changes were triggered by the drought which reduced vegetation cover and allowed increased water flows into pools. At a certain point, some lakes became deep enough to last through the dry season and, in some areas, the historically migratory communities responded by settling permanently near the lakes. A second hypothesis to be tested is that intense grazing activity now maintains a level of degradation and runoff in these watersheds that perpetuates the perennial lake state and permanent settlement.  This project explores these complex interactions and feedbacks between climate, vegetation dynamics, landscape hydrology, and the human societies that depend on and manage these systems. <br/><br/>In Africa, the Sahel is a socio-economically vital region, important for livestock production but vulnerable to drought and famine.  Increasing our knowledge of coupled human-natural system dynamics in the Sahel, including the processes that lead to rapid transitions in ecosystem and socioeconomic function, is vital to the wellbeing of vulnerable populations.  This project will provide outreach to governmental, non-governmental, pastoral and agricultural communities in West Africa, expand university curriculum on coupled human and natural systems, and train graduate and undergraduate students.

Approaches exploiting this and other genomic data will be used, including measures of expression of heat stress genes of both hosts and symbionts under different thermal environments. These studies will reveal how heat sensitivity is affected by symbiont distributions among hosts as well as by genetic variation in stress responses. In addition, the ecological consequences of variation in thermal tolerances will be examined under field environments; these experiments will reveal how heat tolerance interacts with additional biological factors, such as predators and parasites, to determine population density and persistence.  <br/><br/>Chronic infection is a normal part of the life cycle for most animals, including humans and insects, but it is not known how such infection affects tolerance to changing environmental conditions. At the same time, the forces that maintain symbiotic associations are dependent on the joint effects of genetic and environmental factors, but no studies have addressed these together. In this project, researchers with expertise in both ecology and molecular biology will apply methodologies from both fields to obtain answers to these issues. By illuminating the molecular and ecological mechanisms through which heat affects animal populations, the findings will demonstrate how geographic ranges and abundances of individual species are impacted by changes in climate over time. Results will be particularly relevant to insects that are agricultural pests and vectors of disease, a large proportion of which have symbiotic associations similar to those of aphids.

Buss<br/>Yale University<br/><br/>The world's oceans are undergoing pronounced environmental changes and, with climate alteration, are expected to continue to do so. If organisms are to survive these challenges they must alter their physiological tolerances to environmental factors or disperse to locations within their existing tolerances. At present, our knowledge of the genetic foundations of tolerance, adaptation or dispersal is scant, scattered, and idiosyncratic. However, if an appropriate system is developed, genomic technologies have the capacity to rapidly and near-exhaustively characterize all genes involved in the response to an experimental environmental challenge. At present, genomic technologies can be considered mature for only a handful of organisms and none of these are experimentally tractable marine organisms. This award has the dual objectives of generating biological resources necessary to establish Trichoplax adhaerens as a model system for marine environmental genomics, and to perform experiments intended to demonstrate the utility of this system in identifying environmentally responsive genes. <br/>In the first instance, the award will support the maintenance of a standard laboratory line of Trichoplax, the production of a normalized full-length cDNA library, and the end-sequencing of some 8,000 clones from this library. These clones will permit the production of a first generation gene expression microarray comprised of up to 5,000 unique genes. The intermediate range goal is to use microarrays in experiments to identify those genes which respond when the environmental conditions deteriorate to a point at which the animals are induced to disperse. Three distinct forms of environmental deterioration will be assessed: exposure to salinity maxima, to thermal maxima, and  to critical population densities. Genes which are up-regulated, down-regulated, and those for which expression remains unaltered will be identified in Latin Square statistical design. Of particular interest will be genes whose expression is altered in a parallel fashion in all treatments, as numbered amongst these genes will be those which transduce environmental signals to elicit dispersal. While intriguing in their own right, these specific studies are expected to have the broadest impact as a proof-of-concept for the viability of marine environmental genomics. From this proof-of concept, the long-range goal will be to develop a tractable model system with which any interested scientist can study how external stimuli in the marine environment are transduced and integrated to ect changes in gene expression. <br/>"

This is particularly true for chemical sensors. While a variety of chemical sensor systems have been demonstrated, there are few that can operate unattended for long periods (>3 months) in aquatic systems. Here, we propose to develop and refine a variety chemical sensor or sampler systems for extended endurance, autonomous observations. The operation of these instruments will be verified by deploying them in an experimental Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory (LOBO) in the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (ESNERR) at the head of Monterey Bay. LOBO will be an array of moorings equipped with autonomous chemical and physical sensors and water samplers that will be operated in near real-time. A key element of this project will be verification of the long-term performance of the sensor systems by utilizing the observatory to perform fundamental observations of biogeochemical cycles. The initial operation of the observatory system will be demonstrated with two nitrate sensor systems, which we have developed, that can operate for 3 to 4 month periods without intervention. These sensors will be augmented with additional detection systems for phosphate, silicate, ammonia, iron, pH and CO2 that are in various stages of development. The observatory will consist of an array of 6 mooring 'nodes' deployed along a transect from the ocean into and along the channel of Elkhorn Slough. Each mooring will incorporate several chemical sensors, as well as basic physical (T, S, depth, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) sensors. In-situ water samplers will also be mounted on the moorings to collect samples for chemical concentration and isotope analyses that will allow us to independently validate sensor measurements and the biogeochemical processes that are inferred from the observations. A coupled hydrodynamic model of Elkhorn Slough will allow us to calculate mass balances and source and sink terms for chemical cycling. The sensor array will be linked to the Internet in near real-time through a wireless Local Area Network. <br/><br/>The work proposed here can be generalized to a broad range of coastal environments, many of which are subject to coastal environments. As such, our system should be considered a pilot project to assess the feasibility of operating biogeochemical observatories for scientific, environmental management and educational purposes. ""The network is the sensor"". Our goal is only met when we demonstrate this to be true with substantial and novel results that enhance our ability to study, manage and utilize ecosystems for education. In order to accomplish this, we must design a chemical sensor network that can operate continuously, remain in calibration, and assimilate data within short enough periods to facilitate focused studies and training exercises. Such a real time system will provide unique educational opportunities to inform the public about biogeochemical processes in the coastal zone, and will provide valuable data to be used for wetland management purposes.<br/>"

Two key bacterial behaviors that may influence remineralization rates are dormancy and attachment to plankton. Both of these behaviors are phenotypically plastic, allowing bacteria to respond to changes in their environment. For example, a high dormancy rate (30-95%) suggests that the bacterial community has a tremendous capability to respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions that trigger the transition back to a metabolically active state. In contrast, little is known about the potential impact of bacteria living on planktonic substrates on ecosystem processes.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to study the interaction between dormancy and attachment behaviors using whole-genome expression profiles for a focal species (Vibrio cholerae) under contrasting environmental conditions in both the field and laboratory. We are particularly interested in determining (1) the extent to which dormancy and attachment may be co-regulated under realistic environmental conditions and (2) how these behaviors might be altered by anthropogenic activities such as land use change or organic pollution. We will conduct three interrelated studies, each using microarrays, that will make major contributions to our understanding of the genetic processes that instigate transitions between active and dormant states and between unattached and attached states.<br/>Aim 1 contrasts the temporal dynamics of gene expression in unattached and attached bacteria under favorable vs. unfavorable environmental conditions over a two-week period. This will be the first comprehensive analysis of genetic co-regulation of dormancy and SRBs.<br/><br/> Aim 2 will determine the direct effects and interactions of four key environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, and nutrients) on gene expression in bacteria exposed to three different microhabitats (unattached, attached to zooplankton, attached to phytoplankton). This will be one of the first multi-factor experiments with microarrays, and will require introduction of new methods for analyzing microarray data.<br/><br/> Aim 3 will quantify gene expression under seasonally varying field conditions using in situ incubations of bacteria in Bangladeshi ponds with contrasting anthropogenic impacts. As such, this will be one of the first projects to use microarrays to evaluate gene expression in a natural system rather than under laboratory conditions.<br/><br/>The focal species, V. cholerae, is ideal for investigating these questions: it is found in plankton communities worldwide, is representative of a large family of bacteria (the Vibrionaceae), and has a fully sequenced and well-studied genome which enables the use of microarray technology.  V. cholerae is also of considerable medical importance as the etiological agent of cholera.  This research will be accomplished by an interdisciplinary and international team of researchers who specialize in ecology, microbiology, genetics and statistics. We plan to make all microarray results publicly available, and to educate the scientific community and the public about our results through a website, talks at scientific meetings, and our undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/>"

Active (lytic) viral infections cause cell to lyse and thus control carbon flow through marine microbial food webs, in some cases initiating the collapse of algal blooms.  In contrast, inactive (lysogenic) infections confer immunity to superinfection and cause conversion to a diverse array of phenotypes. The majority of marine bacteria in culture produce some type of virus-like particles (VLP.s), indicating that the occurrence of lysogeny is widespread.  Marine viral genomes are economical to study because of their small size (usually 50-100 kb). <br/><br/>The biocomplexity of viromics arises from the interaction and response of viral genomes to environmental cues. This project will focus on lysogeny, whereby a viral genome establishes a stable interaction with its host. The occurrence of lysogeny in the marine environment is complex, as indicated by the seasonal distribution of lysogens observed in estuarine environments. The lytic-lsyogenic shift is hypothesized to occur when viral genes respond to environmental cues, and preliminary evidence suggests that phosphate levels and the pho genes may play a role in this interaction. Specific research objectives are to: 1) determine what physiological and environmental cues catalyze the shift from lysogenic to lytic lifestyles in cultures and natural microbial populations, 2) sequence the genomes of several temperate phages, 3) determine how phage genes work together to confer lytic or lysogenic existence in marine bacteria, and 4) incorporate the effects of temperate phage into models of the marine microbial food web. <br/><br/>The first objective will be addressed by employing cultures (cyanobacteria and heterotrophic <br/>bacteria) and natural populations to investigate cues that might control the ""lysogenic decision"". <br/>Cultures and natural populations will be exposed to shifts in temperature, nutrients, sunlight, <br/>salinity, and exposure to xenobiotics to elicit shift from lytic to lysogeny and vice versa. For the second objective, five of these phage-host systems will be sequenced. Comparative genomics will be used to identify common genes and modules. For the third objective, prophage gene expression will be quantified by northern analysis.  Differences in patterns of expression will yield information on genome response to shifting environmental conditions. If conserved lysogeny genes are found in cyanophage, their expression in natural bacterial populations of Tampa Bay will be measured. Finally, a computational model will be developed to describe the interaction of temperate phage with marine microbial food webs, based upon a 13 month seasonal study of lysogeny in Tampa Bay. The broader impacts of this research include educational outreach in the form of undergraduate workshops at San Diego State University, and participation in Oceanography Camp for Girls and Project Oceanography at the University of South Florida. <br/>"

Results from recently funded NSF research indicate that these living examples of Earth's oldest macrofossi s form by repeated transitions among three distinct microbial communities, whose predominance appears to be driven by interactions between microbial population dynamics, biogeochemical cycling, and mineral deposition. The compact nature of this ecosystem allows components to be sampled, experimentally manipulated, and modeled, such that the sensitivity of the system to internal and external perturbations can be evaluated and biogeochemical cycling and minera formation can be quantified. It is thus an ideal model system for investigating functional linkages between microbes, minerals, and the environment and for addressing fundamental questions such as ""what is the role of biodiversity in biogeochemical processes and what are the effects of geochemical processes on species richness ?how do microorganisms modify and adapt to their abiotic environment? what constrains a seemingly 'equilibrium 'state and what are the forces that produce ecosystem transitions?"" <br/><br/>The proposed research will use diverse but highly complementary methodologies to investigate the complexity of the stromatolite ecosystem over spatial scales ranging from single cells (m) to kilometers and temporal scales ranging from minutes to seasonal and multi-annual.

Our studies of microbial populations will focus on composition, abundance, and distribution of species in four main functional groups (cyanobacteria, aerobic heterotrophs, sulfate reducers, and sulfide oxidizers) using a variety of techniques including 16S rDNA, Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled to confocal microscopy. A combination of field measurements and flume experiments will determine the response of populations, metabolic rates, and chemical gradients to variations in hydrodynamic conditions, sedimentation and light; chemical gradients will be measured in situ using microelectrodes. As exopolymeric secretions (EPS) are likely to regulate mass transport and so the exchange within the stromatolites, EPS structure and composition will be measured using a variety of techniques, including Fourier-Transform Infrared and Raman spectroscopies, atomic force microscopy, and GC-MS; solute flux will be measured using benthic chambers. Effects of EPS properties and elemental cycling on mineral deposition will be determined through construction of C, O and S budgets, complemented by studies of Ca 2+ binding, microscopy analyses to define micrometer-scale relationships between activities and microstructure, and culture studies of precipitation by species. Flume and field studies will determine critical erosion thresholds and erosion rates of emergent macrostructures. Finally, we will look for 'fingerprints'of microbial and environmental processes preserved in the rock record through analyses of stable isotopes, morphometric parameters, and intracrystalline organic matter. Ultimately, a full understanding of the stromatolite system will rely on development of quantitative models.<br/><br/>Three separate modeling approaches, which relate to different aspects of the stromatolite ecosystem, will be developed -(1)a diagenetic model, which will quantify elemental cycles;(2) a simulation model, which will quantify the interactions between elemental cycles, populations of microbes and community status in the stromatolite and (3) a stage-based matrix model, which will attempt to relate environmental components to the distribution of, and transitions among, the microbial assemblages at the level of the ecosystem. These models will serve as critical tools for understanding the reciprocal interactions between elemental cycles, microbial populations, and sedimentation in past,present, and future environments on earth and beyond.<br/><br/>Educational activities that foster the integration of education and multidisciplinary research will include (1) active participation of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in field and lab studies, and an international student exchange program (2) expansion and maintenance of the RIBS public web site; and (3)a field guide to Bahamian stromatolites for the general public. Participation by four European scientists will establish global networks for continuing collaborative studies in the emerging field of geomicrobiology.<br/>"

The United States has set ambitious goals of producing from biomass 25% of its chemicals and materials, and 20% of its transportation fuel by 2030.  Such a shift to biobased production will have profound impacts throughout the coupled industrial, agricultural and social systems.  Very little information is available on the material flow cycles of the envisioned bioeconomy, especially on how those cycles are linked together, and on what the implications of changes in those cycles might be for resource availability, economics, the environment, and options for government policy.  This research will use an integrated set of local, regional and global models to study the implications of near- and long-term bioeconomy scenarios.  In parallel with physical process and substance flow modeling, agriculture sector economic and environmental modeling, and social impact assessment will be used to explore market structure, production, and social drivers as influences on future material flows in the bioeconomy. Researchers at Dartmouth College and the World Resources Institute will participate on this project.  In partnership with the Authentic Teaching Alliance (ATA) we will use interest in the bioeconomy to motivate basic science education by designing and testing learning modules for high school science classes around key biobased conversion and production concepts.  It is expected that results from this project will allow us to better understand: (1) The flows of materials in the bioeconomy; (2) if biobased production requires trade-offs with water quality, climate change, and food production; and if so, the nature and extent of those trade-offs; (3) the ability of agriculture to supply the feedstock needs of large-scale bioproduction; (4) the coupling within the bioeconomy between water quality and climate change brought about by changes in the flow of nitrogen and carbon compounds; (5) the factors that influence farmers' willingness to produce for the bioeconomy; and (6) the impacts of policy mechanisms designed to promote the development of a bioeconomy. This award will be managed by program officers in CMS / ENG, ECS / ENG and DMII / ENG, reflecting the breadth of expertise brought to this broad multidisciplinary topic in biocomplexity. <br/>"

The geologic record indicates that the Sand Hills have gone through cycles of desertification and restoration several times in the Holocene and most dunes are thought to be less than 9000 years old. Today the dunes are almost entirely stabilized by native grasslands. Major droughts destabilized significant portions of the Sand Hills as recently as 1000 years before the present, but the dunes have maintained their grass cover and resisted mobilization during several subsequent regional droughts.<br/><br/>The research proposed here would initiate a large-scale manipulative experiment to test four hypotheses regarding the effect of devegetation on groundwater recharge. Coupled with micrometeorological measurements of surface energy fluxes, the results will provide inputs for mesoscale modeling scenarios of the feedbacks between the (de-)vegetated land surface and the regional climate. The investigators will also use optically stimulated luminescence dating to map the spatial pattern of dune field activity during the last 2500 years, with lake sediment analyses providing a more high resolution (decadal) record of past droughts.<br/><br/>This system will serve as a model for how biogeophysical processes interact to yield landscape resistance and ecological resilience. The structure of the Sand Hills is relatively simple and the area large enough to influence boundary layer dynamics. This will be the first project to understand the Sand Hills using such an integrated, cross-disciplinary project. A range of scientists from such disciplines as paleoecology, geomorphology, ecology, geospatial analysis, and meteorological has been assembled for this task..  <br/><br/>In terms of Broader Impacts, this project can serve as a model system for interdisciplinary teaching about complex environmental change both at the K-12 as well as university levels. Nonlinearities and feedbacks are very real to anyone walking through this landscape, especially after recent dune blowouts. The project will incorporates an already successful ongoing K-12 science teacher network, including summer internships and workshops for science educators, and a web site with data visualization tools that puts data in the hands of students. The project will also train over 30 graduate students and undergraduate interns, exposing them to the breadth of contemporary environmental science.<br/>"

Over the past 2-3 years, there has been significant progress on analyzing the temporal dynamics of interacting hydrologic-ecosystem processes. This research intends to advance these efforts by incorporating spatial variability of these processes and interactions, a key to answering the ""where?"" related questions in addition to the ""when?"" related questions. The proposed research methodology is based on a systems-level stochastic modeling and field experimental framework that has been used by the PIs to aggregate physical, chemical and biological processes occurring at several spatial and temporal scales, quantifying biogeochemical stocks and fluxes as well as providing estimates of their uncertainty. Validation of this eco-hydrological model will be accomplished through proposed field experimental tests in the Everglades (Florida) and Cerrado (Brazil) ecosystems. This comparative ecosystem approach offers the benefit of quantifying and differentiating between general and site-specific eco-hydrological interactions.<br/><br/>This proposal is a joint effort between investigators at the University of Miami (UM, USA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Universidade de Brasilia (UNB, Brazil), and the University of Buenos Aires (IFEVA/UBA, Argentina).

While networks of intelligent agents transparently embedded into our physical environment could advance human welfare in a number of domains, research indicates that any successful wireless sensor network must be carefully optimized for its application.  Our goals are to (i) complete the development of wireless environmental sensor network technology, (ii) make significant progress in understanding the maintenance of biodiversity and in measuring ecosystem properties by applying this technology to three field projects, (iii) build awareness of the benefits of the technology to society, and (iv) improve collaboration between engineering and the sciences. The instrumentation development component of this project builds on a successful seed effort in which we have constructed a small proof-of-concept wireless environmental sensing network. We will build a ""distributed instrument""--a prototype network comprising hundreds of palm-sized wireless sensors. In anticipation of this prototype development, we have paid careful attention to ensuring that our networking technology will scale up to thousands of sensors, providing dense coverage at landscape geographic scales.<br/><br/>The prototype network technology will be deployed to enable a new degree of data quality in three diverse field studies. First, we will probe the role of the role of fine-scale environmental phenomena in the maintenance of ecosystem diversity in two Eastern US forests. The second experiment maps the complexity of microclimates and their effects on biodiversity in the crowns of the coastal redwoods of California. And in the third field study, we will determine the effects of scale on eddy covariance measurements of ecosystem energy balance in Northern Arizona.

Such a laser source presents significant advantages over more traditional laser systems for achieving high measurement precision.<br/><br/>The instrument will be used to acquire high precision atmospheric measurements of 13CO2/12CO2 ratios - a measurement currently accomplished by a network of flask samples followed by mass spectrometric analysis. These data are crucial for understanding terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks which requires an understanding of the distribution, contribution, and evolution of regional and local CO2 source and sink processes.

The response of these large carbon reservoirs to Global Warming, however, remains uncertain. Different mathematical models predict that future warming could alter the carbon balance of peatlands by either increasing the rate of carbon sequestration or accelerating the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, these steady-state analytical models make unrealistic assumptions about natural peatlands, which are spatially and temporally variable ecosystems that are still accumulating carbon. This investigation will therefore develop a transient 3D numerical model that couples multiphase groundwater flow to solute transport, organic matter reactivity, and peat accumulation. The need for such a model is supported by our investigations in large peat basins over the past 25 years that demonstrate the close linkages among climate, groundwater, landscape, and peatland carbon fluxes. This new transient groundwater-peat accumulation model will be calibrated by multiple sets of field, lab, and remote sensing data collected at a range of scales. A sensitivity analysis of this calibrated model should then provide reliable predictions for the response of large peat basins to climate change at the regional level.<br/><br/>This approach can best be tested in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (GLAP) of northern Minnesota where a regional peat basin developed despite the relatively dry climate and periodic droughts. Recent advances in remote sensing, field instrumentation, geophysical exploration, and computational modeling will be used to develop and calibrate a transient coupled groundwater-peat accumulation model for the GLAP region. This interdisciplinary investigation will focus on several important problems including carbon cycling in the deeper peat and the hydraulics of a deformable media. This study will also determine if methane fluxes from large peatlands are dominated by ebullition (i.e., bubbling) from deep overpressured gas pockets representing a globally important and previously unaccounted for source of atmospheric methane. In addition, this investigation will evaluate whether the configuration of the regional river system amplifies the effects of climate change on peatland ecosystems.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this study will be extended by 1) training graduate and undergraduate students in a large interdisciplinary investigation, 2) providing outreach to K-12 schools and the general public, 3) developing 3D computer visualization exhibits for state parks and other interpretive centers, and 4) linking our research results to regional and national educational programs organized by Morin. The visualization exhibits will be specifically designed for a new $1.6 million interpretive center at the Big Bog Recreational Area, which was recently established by the State of Minnesota adjacent to our field area. This exhibit will link results from our field measurements to the role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle for the general public. It will continue the long tradition of close cooperation between the GLAP research group and the officials that manage public land in northern Minnesota and elsewhere."

Many pollutants are introduced into the environment as a result of combustion processes, and there is a growing realization that important pathways related to the production of the pollutants involve heterogeneous processes, i.e., surface reactions, for which, there is no clear mechanistic picture of the reaction pathways or kinetics.  This project carries to develop instrumentation that generates essential information regarding how pollutants with significant health effects are formed, and thereby provide the knowledge required for reducing their production.  An end-station for synchrotron-based x-ray spectroscopy experiments will be developed for monitoring microscopic aspects of combustion processes.  The end-station will be a vacuum system with a temperature-regulated sample holder that can be dosed with reactants of interest.  The system will be designed so that fluorescence yield XAFS(s-ray absorption fine structure) spectroscopy can be performed in a variety of ways.  Different types of x-ray spectra will be generated.  Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy will be used for determining structural information, and x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy will be used for chemical fingerprinting applications.  Specifically, this end-station will be optimized for probing how chlorine-containing aromatic species (e.g., chlorophenols) are adsorbed on metal oxide surfaces, and how they react to form polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibensofurans (PCDD/Fs).  EXAFS spectra will be used to determine how aromatic compounds (such as 2-chlorophenol) are adsorbed on oxidized metal surfaces.  Also, EXAFS spectra will be used to determine structural information on reaction intermediates after the reaction has been allowed to progress.  It will also be possible to generate kinetic data on combustion processes by probing a more limited spectral range, the XANES region.<br/>%%%<br/>The key point unifying these ideas is that by combining techniques from environmental science and x-ray spectroscopy, wholly new types of data can generated to elucidate chemical pathways that generate pollutants in combustion processes.  Students trained in areas of instrumentation development and applications to environmental sciences, which are also priorities for U.S. industry, will be highly competitive in this job market.<br/>"

The structural and chemical fidelity of these biocomplexity indicators depend on the size of carbon reservoirs available to the microbes.

In Africa, the savannas are also home to the greatest density and diversity of large herbivores and carnivores of any ecosystem on earth.  However, the mixture of trees and grasses that defines savanna systems is inherently unstable and multiple factors related to soil type, climate, herbivore density, and wild-fire frequency are thought to contribute to their coexistence. Thus savannas are biocomplex systems where processes such as grazing intensity and fire frequency simultaneously depend on and control savanna structure, productivity and nutrient recycling.<br/>This project will investigate biocomplexity in the context of African savannas. We are developing the conceptual and numerical understanding of savanna ecosystems that will allow prediction of savanna structure and function resulting from the complex interactions and feedback between driving variables. This will include the change in stable states under varying conditions, the resilience of the different forms of savanna to change, and the thresholds between stable states. The project will further use savanna systems as a general model for understanding complexity in biological systems and to develop methods of analysis and interpretive tools that promote a broader public understanding of the inter-relatedness of environmental systems.  <br/><br/>"

A breakthrough in characterization, monitoring, and modeling approaches is needed to resolve this issue. In this proposal, we propose a novel hydraulic tomography approach to characterize, monitor, and predict the hyporheic zone and beyond, using spatial-temporal variations in river stages and the corresponding groundwater responses near a river.  This new technology allows three-dimensional imaging and determination of fluxes across the river/groundwater boundaries and characterization of the hyporheic and subsurface system in a manner that is presently not feasible.  If this proposed proof-of-concept study is successful, the technology can ultimately be extended to basin/watershed scale problems.<br/> The goal of the study is to demonstrate that hydraulic tomography based on river stage fluctuations is a valid concept and a viable technology for detecting large-scale subsurface heterogeneity near the river.  We intend to show that the concept and technology can accomplish its goal in unconfined aquifers that interact with rivers.  Proposed tasks include: 1) the modification of existing hydrologic tomography inversion algorithm to accommodate temporally and spatially varying boundary conditions, which represent the temporally and spatially varying river stages; 2) the examination of the effects of temporal and spatial varying river stage on groundwater level in synthetic heterogeneous unconfined aquifers through numerical simulations; 3) the use of these simulated well hydrographs in the modified inversion algorithms to test its ability to detect heterogeneity within the hyporheic zone; and 4) the conduct of laboratory studies using two existing sandboxes with a synthetic heterogeneous unconfined aquifer.<br/>Results from the study should demonstrate that while river stages may change rapidly in time and space, the tomographic inversion is a valid and logical approach as long as the variation of the river stages is well characterized.<br/>"

Among the more complex symbioses is the mutualism between benthic marine invertebrates, especially cnidarians, and photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae).  This type of symbiosis has had a key role in the formation of an important marine ecosystem, the coral reef.  Little is known about the molecular basis for the establishment and maintenance of these common biological relationships. The symbiosis between scleractinian corals and their zooxanthellae is highly susceptible to changes in environmental factors such as elevated seawater temperature and/or elevated light levels. Global warming has impacted coral reefs world wide by causing the disruption of these symbioses (coral bleaching), causing many corals to subsequently die. It is now urgent to gain a better understanding of the molecular and cellular interactions that are critical to the functional integrity of these symbioses. <br/>The PIs have assembled a team of coral reef biologists (Coffroth, Szmant) with a long record of field experience in studying symbiotic relationships in marine ecosystems, genome scientists (Medina, Manohar, Nelson, Terry) with wide-ranging expertise in high throughput genomic techniques and analysis of data generated by such methods, and educational experts (Tang) with high impact capabilities for public outreach through the educational programs in a museum/aquarium setting. The PIs have several members on the team who are part of minority groups, including six women (Coffroth, Manohar, Medina, Szmant, Tang, and Terry), two Hispanic (Medina, Szmant), and two Asian-Americans (Manohar, Tang).<br/>The PIs are using microarray expression profiling developed from expressed sequence tags (EST) data to identify genes and cellular pathways involved in the host-zooxanthellae symbiosis in the Montastraea faveolata mutualistic system from Caribbean tropical reef areas. They are performing gene manipulation experiments to establish function of these genes.  When accompanied by sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing them, this approach will contribute to understanding how these genes are regulated in both the host and the symbiont. The research is the first attempt to look at a very important mutualistic relationship using a genome wide analysis of gene expression.  The PIs are making all the resources generated by this project (ESTs, microarrays, cDNA and BAC libraries) available through several outreach programs. <br/>Gaining a better understanding of host-symbiont relationships in coral reef ecosystems can have implications for atmospheric and ocean sciences, conservation biology and the study and diagnosis of microbial diseases in corals. Consequently, this project will be of great interest to a broader scientific community.<br/>"

Key questions revolve around understanding the design, efficiency and capacity of biorefineries, the material and energy cycles of bioproduction, and the durability of bioproducts during the product use stage. To gain a better understanding of these aspects of bio-based production, modeling the complex interplay of economics and policy with other factors such as technical innovations, scientific breakthroughs, and advances in design and product development will be necessary. The overall goals of this planning project are to create a foundation for a holistic approach to bio-based production and to construct a viable framework for evaluating future advances in sustainable bioproduction. <br/>     The project has three parts. First, a rigorous life cycle assessment (LCA) will be conducted for a promising biomolecule, polylactic acid (PLA) inclusive of the agricultural, processing, and product use cycles. Conducting an LCA at this time can help to focus on those processing steps or components of the system that offer the greatest potential for environmental benefit and are the most sensitive to economic and policy considerations. Second, a workshop will be convened with experts from both technical/scientific and economic/policy areas. This workshop is envisioned as complimentary to previous workshops and symposia on the topic (Dartmouth 2001, AIChE 2002, Oklahoma 2003) in that emphasis will be placed on the inclusion of economics and policy elements and how these inform and in turn are informed by scientific and technical findings. Third, the results of the LCA and workshop will be incorporated into educational materials through involvement with the Chicago Academy of Sciences' Nature Museum, a facility with extensive educational outreach programs in the community<br/>"

The solubility pump injects carbon into the deep sea through the sinking of cold waters at high latitudes where CO2 solubility is enhanced. The oceanic biological pump is highly dynamic and variable in space and time. This process consists in the production of organic carbon by organisms in the surface ocean and the subsequent sequestration of this material below the winter mixed layer. Significant effort has gone into understanding the controls of the biological pump and while the general function is understood, the details remain elusive. At present, processes in the surface euphotic zone are much better understood than those of the Twilight Zone (i.e. mesopelagic). It is within the poorly understood Twilight Zone that changes in C attenuation on sinking particles and the composition of sinking material occur, with important consequences for the rates of C uptake and exchange at the surface ocean with the atmosphere and for longer term C sequestration in the deep sea.<br/><br/>This proposal will develop improved particle flux collectors and use these to answer key science questions associated with C fluxes and exchange via sinking particles at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site. Currently at BATS, the surface ocean C budgets are unbalanced, and production and community structure fail to predict particle export. At the same time, these questions are being addressed with an imperfect tool, the drifting sediment trap, a device that has not changed significantly since the early 1980's. This program includes the development and engineering of new tools while collecting time-series data. The project builds upon the recently developed neutrally buoyant sediment trap (NBST), which will be modified for continuous flux collection and swimmer free samples to a new design: the Twilight Zone EXplorer (TZEX).<br/><br/>In context of the C and Water in the Earth System Program, this proposal advances our understanding of the carbon cycle by combining the following multidisciplinary elements: (1) basic research in ocean biology obtained from ship based observations and remote sensing; (2) geochemistry of particles and waters and how these change with depth and time; (3) modeling of biological processes and particle transport in moving fluids; and (4) the engineering and application of novel observational equipment to capture sinking particles. These unique sediment trap devices will open up a new window to assess the ocean's role as a C sink and how marine export production will change in response to climate change.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: By improving understanding of the carbon cycle in the mesopelagic twilight zone, this project will contribute to society's ability to anticipate the impacts of global climate change as well as to formulate remediation strategies. Educational and public outreach impact include berth space for high school, undergraduate and graduate students, journalists, an undergraduate student fellow and two graduate students. Finally, the significant instrumentation development and application component will likely bear significant fruit for the broader oceanographic community.<br/><br/>"

The objectives of this project are to 1) characterize the diversity of microorganisms in LCdA sediments using modern molecular biology techniques, 2) quantify the role of individual members of the microbial community in biogeochemical cycling of metals (Cu, Pb, and Zn), and 3) develop a dynamic numeric biogeochemical model of heavy metal cycling in sediment systems, calibrated to the unique environments of LCdA.  These objectives will be met while testing the following overall hypothesis:<br/>A complex and dynamic community of phylogenetically distinct and previously uncharacterized microorganisms is present in the historically metal-contaminated sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene.  In response to a toxic metal stress, metal-tolerant species will dominate metal-sensitive species present in the sediments, with temporal and spatial microbial distribution and diversity dependant on the metal type and concentration.  Dynamic biogeochemical models that incorporate chemical transport and reaction with novel microbial stress/response relationships and community dynamics can be used to 1) integrate complex microbial and geochemical observations across spatial and temporal scales, and 2) better predict broad community level response and influence on toxic metal cycling.<br/>Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: This project will significantly improve the quantitative understanding of interaction and response of a sediment microbial community subjected to severe heavy metal stress.  Project objectives will be achieved by sampling LCdA sediments and identifying microbial diversity based on both 16S rDNA and rpoB gene sequences.  These molecular techniques greatly facilitate the study of microbes in their natural environments and will provide a rational platform to base observations of community response to toxic metal additions.  Shifts in microbial populations after being subjected to metal-stress will be quantified using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP).  Focused laboratory studies will be used to quantify the effects of toxic metals on microbial growth and inhibition for incorporation into the predictive model. The modeling effort will integrate for the first time to our knowledge, syntrophic consortium biotransformation dynamics, dose-dependent inhibition, and spatial and temporal dynamics of redox front formation under a diffusive transport regime.  <br/>Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity:  While the research is focused on microbial communities in historically metal contaminated LCdA sediment, with increased industrialization worldwide, interactions of the environment and human contaminants have become more important issues, scientifically and socially, to the U.S. and internationally.  The project integrates research mentoring and training of graduates, postdoctoral associate, and a research faculty.  A supplemental grant for research experiences for undergraduates will be used to integrate undergraduate students into the research.  The results will be published in a number of quality peer reviewed journal articles and will be conveyed to the public through presentations at local regulatory and public meetings, and at national and international conferences.  An internet web site written for both scientists and non-technical readers will be developed.  When complete, this research will significantly expand the fundamental and quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes for metals.  The project has the potential to suggest fundamental improvements in metals-bioremediation technologies, since results will be broadly applicable in supporting innovative biological strategies to reduce human health risks and environmental damage from metal contaminated sites<br/>"

However, the spatial and temporal variation of CO2 production and efflux from catchment soils remains poorly understood.  We are just beginning to develop the methods to up-scale from point measurements such as those made by flux towers or respiration chambers to larger spatial scales such as plots or watersheds.  How the primary CO2 forcing factors vary across climatic, environmental, biogeochemical, and topographic gradients needs to be addressed.  In addition, complementary investigation of the topographic controls on C accumulation and the mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) s central to understanding the links between the landscape and the C cycle at the watershed scale.  Many investigations of C allocation and movement focus on atmospheric exchange, neglecting the loss of C in stream water.  Recent work has given us insight into the processes controlling the timing and magnitude of stream water C exports.  We believe that understanding topographic controls and stream-catchment connections are integral to understanding total C flux from catchments.   The concept of biogeochemical similarity, related to hydrological similarity, has been identified as a powerful tool in understanding the spatial patterns of biogeochemical processes.  Our research will test the applicability of this concept for soil respiration and DOC export and will identify the critical set of measurements necessary to quantify the spatial and temporal variability in the first-order controls on soil CO2 production and surface efflux.  This field-derived information will then inform and constrain our model that simulates the variability <br/>of these parameters through space and time.

The objectives of this research are (1) to quantify CO2 efflux and to develop and apply a model of catchment respiration, incorporating soil air pCO2, vertical soil water transport of dissolved CO2, and surface CO2 efflux, (2) to explore the extent to which topography can be used to explain the variability inherent in the factors driving respiration, and (3) To quantify the <br/>topographic controls on the distribution of soil C in the watershed and link C accumulation in the landscape, DOC transport, and stream DOC export at the watershed scale.     <br/>Intellectual merit of the proposed activity This work will provide empirical information and the foundation for development and application of a framework for understanding the spatial and temporal variably of soil respiration and resultant soil air CO2 concentration, atmospheric exchange, and streamwater C export.   <br/>Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity. <br/>The inclusion of undergraduates and graduate students in all aspects of research is a primary goal of this <br/>work.

This research will provide Frostburg students, both now and in the future with experience and opportunities through collaborative linkages made between Frostburg State University, The University of Virginia, and Montana State University (EPSCoR institution).  Students will be integral members of the research team and will be encouraged to take ownership of their contributions through publication and presentation of their findings at national meetings.  This research will enhance teaching activities (undergraduate and graduate) through inclusion of near real-time data in class exercises and field-based learning.  <br/>This work will also strengthen the research infrastructure at Frostburg, helping to advance students and faculty from undergraduate institutions that are underrepresented in the fields of hydrology and biogeochemistry.  If funded, the Big Sky Institute for Science and Natural History has agreed to provide additional support for participation of a graduate student in the BSI Graduate Fellows Program. Under that program, the Fellow would receive training in effective communication of their results to K-12 communities and the public.  The fellows program provides graduate students training and opportunities to communicate science, encourages young scientists to understand their role in disseminating scientific findings to the public, and helps fulfill BSI.s mission of combining current <br/>research with inquiry-based learning for people of all ages and all walks of life.  This work will also produce a dataset of soil air CO2 concentrations, efflux, semi-distributed field measurements and simulations of driving factors through time, and links to streamwater C export.  Our datasets will be made freely available on the web to other researchers and can serve as a test data set for models of CO2 production, flux, and streamwater C export.  To date, no such dataset is available (to the authors. knowledge), yet this is critical to understanding C accumulation and flux across environmental gradients by providing a testing ground and comparison set. <br/>"

Anaerobic, acidic, sulfidic, thermal springs (AASTS) represent potentially important settings for the earliest organisms on Earth, and the phototrophs inhabiting them (e.g., green sulfur bacteria) are excellent candidates for Earth's earliest photosynthesizers. If environments similar to AASTS were more widespread on the early Earth, the paleo-significance of thermophilic green sulfur bacteria for the global biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur could be immense, and its implications to other element/metallic cycling and mineralization could also be very significant. Understanding phototrophic communities in AASTS could also have practical implications for waste treatment and energy production. The long-term goal of this incubation project is to model the linkage between (i) coupled biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, carbon and other nutrients and (ii) the metabolic activities of phototrophic communities in AASTS. The working hypothesis is that the existence and biodiversity of phototrophic communities are emergent properties of the coupled geochemical cycles in these environments. The cycling of carbon and sulfur in AASTS, along with other environmental parameters (e.g., pO2, pH, T), stabilizes the community composition, which in turn affects the distribution of carbon and sulfur compounds available to microbial communities downstream. This incubation project is specifically designed to establish the basic microbiological and biogeochemical characteristics of AASTS, and lay the foundation for quantitative modeling of the interactions between the two. Modeling of emergent properties of AASTS, specifically the non-linear interactions and feedback between the microbial community and the abiotic environment, requires absolute estimates of microbial diversity and quantification of fluxes of crucial life-sustaining components (e.g., sulfur and carbon). To accomplish this goal classical microbiological and 16S rRNA-based molecular techniques are being utilized to characterize the microbial composition of two recently discovered AASTS inhabited by thermophilic green sulfur bacteria in the Philippines. In parallel, field studies of sulfur, carbon and overall geochemical cycling in the same AASTS are being carried out, focusing on characterizing sulfur and carbon speciation, and using stable S, C and H isotope compositions of isolated species and select biomarkers to study the cycling of these components in these unique microbial habitats. Examining the isotope composition of inorganic sulfur and carbon species in the associated thermal waters will allow the assessment of the magnitude and sequence of S utilization and C fixation in these microbial communities. Finally, preliminary modeling of coupled S and C cycling in relation to the microbial distribution and structure in AASTS will be performed. The initial model will examine species fluxes, transport and transformation in the water column of AASTS, specifically focusing on the interaction between geochemical fluxes and microbial occurrence, composition and distribution. This project plans to foster interdisciplinary scientific research and education for undergraduates, graduate students, international collaborators and the public. Highlights include development of a web-based multi-level Virtual School on Biocomplexity in AASTS and workshops for the Philippine and US collaborators on the same topic. Given the global recognition of the need to preserve and understand unique microbial systems for fundamental and biotechnical reasons, plans are incorporated for strong international partnerships in research and education.<br/>"

Melanie R. Mormile, Francisca E. Oboh-Ikuenobe (University of Missouri-Rolla), and Kathleen C. Benison (Central Michigan University) to determine if evaporites truly trap a representative population of microorganisms from hypersaline environments.  If this is found to be true, these findings can possibly be extrapolated to microorganisms entrapped in ancient or possibly extraterrestrial evaporites and used to describe previous microbial communities and therefore, make interpretations about past water chemistries and past climates.  Microorganisms represent the basic life forms existing in most environmental settings.  They are sensitive to climatic parameters, and can influence water chemistry, biological activity, and mineralization.  Evaporite minerals are a wealth of paleoenvironmental data due to their sensitivity to climate, water chemistry, and hydrology.  In addition, evaporites can form in extreme environmental conditions, such as extremely acid saline lakes in Western Australia.  These lakes might serve as good analogs to Mars.  Traditionally, studies of evaporite settings and their deposits have overlooked microorganisms largely because they are generally poorly preserved in the rock record.  However, through this research, answers to the following questions will be found: What microorganisms are present in the lake waters, groundwaters, and sediments of acid and neutral saline lake environments? Are the microorganisms found living in the waters represented in the fluid inclusions of the evaporite minerals? Are the microorganisms specific acidophiles? What role did the microorganisms play in the evolution of the water chemistry?  To answer these questions, a sampling trip will be made to Australia to collect a comprehensive set of lake water, groundwater, evaporite, and siliciclastic sediment samples.  The following objectives will be achieved: 1. Identify and compare the biological remains in halite and gypsum with those in their parent waters and sediments.  Both traditional culture methods and molecular biology techniques will be used to compare the microbial populations in the environments listed above.  2. Grow evaporite crystals under laboratory conditions to study selected environmental influences on crystal formation and the microorganisms that become entrapped.  3. Identify any differences in microorganisms (ranging from prokaryotes to freshwater dinoflagellates and algae) between neutral and moderately acidic saline lakes and groundwaters in Victoria and Western Australia, between neutral and extremely acidic saline lakes within a small region of Western Australia, as well as among extremely acidic saline lakes and groundwaters in Western Australia.  The 16S rDNA from the bacteria isolated from these environments will be sequenced and compared.  4. Constrain depositional, environmental, and climatic conditions using basic sedimentology, petrography, fluid inclusion studies, and palynology.  Sedimentary structures and grain characteristics will be used to trace depositional history. <br/>We anticipate that novel microorganisms will be found.  These organisms can possibly be used for the bioremediation of contaminated sites that are impacted by extremes in saline and acidic conditions.  In addition, our findings will have implications for future Mars research and the possibility that life can occur on planetary bodies besides Earth.  Of all the planetary bodies explored, Mars most closely resemble Earth.  In particular, terrestrial acid sedimentary systems are similar in general mineralogy, geochemistry, and geomorphology to the Martian surface.  Furthermore, this project will be responsible for the training of students ranging from undergraduate level to Post-Doctoral students.  There is also a significant outreach component that includes a partnership with the St. Louis Science Center as well as a course on the geology and microbiology of extreme environments targeted towards K-12 educators.<br/>"

To date, no multilevel linked cycles have been constructed for any technological materials, such as steel. World steel production has increased by almost a factor of ten since the Second World War. Advances in metallurgy have occurred over the same timeframe, making it possible to produce a wide variety of steels with considerably enhanced properties, achieved through the alloying of iron with small to moderate amounts of a suite of other engineering metals. For some of these elements, industrial use is significantly linked to the demands of steel production. Very little information on the material flow cycles of these elements is available, especially on how those cycles are linked together, and on what the implication of changes in those cycles might be for resource availability, economics, the environment, and options for governmental policy.  <br/>     This research will use a dynamic material flow analysis model to study the linking of the alloying elements, as well as to trace the histories of the ferroalloy element use and to develop long-term scenarios for the future. In parallel, an economic model incorporating materials flows will be developed for the United States to explore market structure, costs, and related drivers as influences on future materials flows. A unique information exchange will be created with a six-member advisory team of researchers from the steel industry, government, and academia representing Europe, Asia and the United States. In order to inform the broader public of the significance of decisions regarding steel and its alloying elements, an exhibit on material flow cycles will be organized for the Yale Peabody Museum. This research directly addresses a key topic, identified by the National Research Council, on ""Reinventing the Use of Materials"". It is expected that the integrated, dynamic framework of MFA and economics that results from this project will enable future research studies on materials and the environment by both national and international researchers in industrial ecology.

Craig Cary, University of Delaware is supported by the program Biocomplexity in the Environment, subprogram Genomic-Enabled Environmental Science and Engineering (BE GEN-EN).  The project focuses on symbiotic associations in deep-sea thermal vent communities. <br/><br/>Closely integrated symbiotic associations between bacteria and eukaryotic hosts abound in nature. This is particularly the case in marine systems where novel associations are being routinely discovered. Whether the bacteria reside externally to the host or endosymbiotically the functional role of these associations often remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding, in part, stems from our inability to cultivate the majority of these symbionts free from their host.  Even in instances where cultivation is possible, it is unlikely that the physiological capacities of bacteria measured in the laboratory truly represent those in the natural ecosystem. The majority of episymbiont associations exist as a phenotypically and phylogenetically mixed population making it extremely difficult to decipher the role of independent members. <br/><br/>This project will employ a community level genomic approach to understand the metabolic potential and phenotypes of the members of a diverse episymbiotic bacterial community found associated with the tube-dwelling polychaete, Alvinella pompejana. This association exists in an extreme deep-sea hydrothermal vent biotope characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals and the steepest thermal gradient experienced by any organism yet described. It is likely that such an environment imposes strong selective pressures on the symbiont/host association. In depth rRNA analysis of the episymbiotic communities associated with A. Pompejana demonstrated the dominance of a diverse assemblage of a single bacterial subdivision (epsilon Proteobacteria). This constraint, found in the episymbiotic communities throughout A. pompejana geographic and physiochemical range, has not been described in any other symbiotic association. Because of the complex nature of this association, no specific roles have been defined for this unique symbiosis by habitat characterizations, in situ enzyme assays, classical cultivation techniques or molecular analysis. This project will address a central hypothesis that by understanding the collective genetic complexity of the episymbiont community one can resolve a core metabolic strategy that defines the<br/>community in the context of its environment.  Our approach assumes that by placing the genome biocomplexity of this community directly into an environmental context we will be able to resolve the ecological role and interrelationships of this microbial/invertebrate association. To achieve this goal, we will conduct a meta-genome scale analysis of the complex microbial community found intimately associated with A. pompejana.  By coupling tightly integrated bioinformatic and modeling components with both environmental characterizations and microarray expression analyses we will then have the ability to genetically dissect the episymbiont community and query their functionality under various physiochemical conditions. The research will involve an interdisciplinary, international team of investigators that bring to the program expertise in microbial ecology, geochemistry, genomic sciences, proteomics and bioinformatics. The productive partnerships between academia and industry that were developed during previous work will allow access to essential technical resources and expertise otherwise unavailable for this type of investigation.<br/>"

The technology uses an artificial neural network and can use, as input, images transmitted over the internet.  At present, obtaining species-level identifications of specimens can be a difficult undertaking.  The number of trained systematizes for most groups of organisms is low; the success rate of non-specialists trying to achieve accurate identifications is often lower.  Such a system has the potential to radically increase the use of biodiversity information in conservation as well as science.  This project is aimed at developing software technology capable of species identification using spiders as test subjects.  The approach is based on digital images of taxonomically relevant structures of the organism taken through a camera-equipped dissecting microscope.  The images are subjected to wavelet transformation, a procedure that extracts shape information from the image while removing less useful, high-resolution information.  By this procedure, the image is reduced to a set of wavelet coefficients that can be supplied to a computing algorithm known as an artificial neural network.  Such networks are capable of learning to classify objects.  The goal is creation of a system with a 95% accuracy in identification.<br/><br/>In the first phase of the project, three datasets will be used: images of two families of Australasian spiders (Trochanteriidae and Prodidomidae), and third set of images defined geographically rather than taxonomically.  This geographic set includes specimens from three consecutive years of collecting at selected sites in Tennessee, and is typical of ecological inventory data.  In the second phase, a web interface that allows submission of images for identification over the internet will be developed.<br/><br/>At present, a severely limiting factor on our understanding of community structure, diversity, and how diversity relates to ecosystem function and resulting human services is the lack of experts capable of identifying biological specimens to species.  Thus, the potential impact of automated identification is enormous.  A system that can identify any species in a particular family, or from a particular area, without requiring the user to have more than the most basic knowledge of the organism to be identified, has the potential to drastically improve the efficiency and scope of biological inventories, and subsequent monitoring efforts.<br/>"

Our main question is: how do humans in cities and on farms alter biogeochemical cycles? We will address this question using a fourfold concept of coupling: (i) between hydrology and element cycling, (ii) among elements (stoichiometry), (iii) across spatial scales (from households to regions), and (iv) between human behavior and element cycling.<br/> Element cycles are controlled by spatial connections at three key scales. Elements move between households (which are key components of urban landscapes) and their surroundings, within and between watersheds (i.e., hierarchically from small upstream (low-order) watersheds downstream to larger, higher-order ones), and between major ecosystem types (e.g., from farm to city). Some of this movement is deliberately controlled (e.g., food import to cities), but a large portion is not (e.g., movement of NOx from autos and landscapes to the atmosphere. Moreover, there are ""hotspots"" within landscapes where disproportionate nutrient inputs, transformations, and losses occur.  <br/> The complexity of human-dominated ecosystems is one reason why our understanding of their biogeochemical cycles has lagged behind that of natural systems.  Nevertheless, for two reasons, now is the time to confront this complexity and develop this understanding. First, we must, as a matter of survival. Second, we can; our ability to acquire, store, and use data has reached the point that we can expect to unravel this complexity to a useful degree and develop new management paradigms.<br/><br/>"

There may also be a temporal dimension to these complex pattems on shorter time scales with, potentially, a response of groundwater arsenic to the monsoon and to increased groundwater usage for irrigation.

Stated as hypotheses, the proposal suggests: 1) extensive<br/>Andean hillslope failure and channel migration during large La Nina associated storms mobilizes vast<br/>quantities of fresh organic matter and sediment with low organic carbon (OC) content ; 2) within the<br/>river, mineral surfaces acquire normal OC loadings via sorption as they are rapidly evacuated from the<br/>mountainous source basins to adjacent foreland depocenters; and 3) deposited sediments preserve ""fresh""<br/>carbon within organo-mineral complexes and by deep burial in point bars and ""crevasse-splay"" deposits<br/>that have little potential for exchange with the biosphere and atmosphere. Calculations presented in the<br/>Project Description (C.1.2) suggest that this process could sequester ~ 300 Mtonnes of carbon per event in<br/>the Amazonian foreland. When extrapolated globally to other humid tropical regions, these estimates are<br/>equivalent to 50-100% of the average annual ""missing carbon sink"" or 50-100% of atmospheric CO2<br/>anomalies typically observed during La Nina.<br/>To explore these hypothesis, proposers will study 1) the rates and mechanics of sediment<br/>mobilization, transport, and deposition of river sediment during extreme events, 2) the associations of<br/>organic carbon with sediments at erosional and depositional sites, and 3) the transfer of OC from rapid<br/>(<5 y) to slower (>50 y) turnover pools, via sorption and deep burial processes. We will employ a<br/>combination of GIS analysis of satellite images to map changes associated with individual large storms<br/>(hillslope failures and river migration); field surveys of sediment transport processes; and laboratory<br/>analysis of archived and newly collected samples to determine organic carbon concentrations, sources and<br/>turnover times; sediment characteristics; and transport/deposition timing and rates (geochronology).<br/>The proposed project is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, multi-national research effort that<br/>builds upon a record of prior and current NSF-funded results of decadal-scale sediment fluxes and organic<br/>carbon dynamics within river basins of the Amazon. In close coordination with sediment-flux,<br/>geochronological, geochemical, and process-mapping (GIS) studies conducted by scientists from Univ. of<br/>Washington, scientists at Stroud Water Research Center and Univ. of California Davis will investigate the<br/>quantities, sources, and sequestration of organic carbon mobilized during by these geomorphological<br/>processes. In addition, this project benefits from a close working collaboration with the French Institut de<br/>Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD), with whom we will conduct fieldwork in the Andes and<br/>foreland basins of Bolivia and Peru during both the dry and wet seasons. Additional collaborations are<br/>with the Univ. Nacional Agraria La Molina (UNALM) and the Univ. of California Santa Barabara. These<br/>continuing international collaborations offer considerable scientific and logistical advantages and cost<br/>savings for this current proposal to study the carbon transported and deposited by extreme storm events.<br/>If this research effort substantiates the primary hypothesis, such continental-scale, climate-driven,<br/>erosion-sedimentation processes will be demonstrated to represent substantial, previously unrecognized<br/>natural carbon sinks of global significance. Furthermore, these processes could potentially result in the<br/>sequestration of similar quantities of carbon by anthropogenically accelerated erosion-sedimentation.<br/>Additionally, this research benefits anyone interested in the geochemical processes of organic carbon<br/>preservation in sediment and soils or the timing/rates/mechanics of landsliding, sediment transport,<br/>channel-floodplain interaction, and sedimentary basin dynamics during extreme, ENSO-orchestrated<br/>floods.<br/>The strong bridging between the disciplines of geomorphology, biogeochemistry and organic<br/>geochemistry has broader impacts on earth science as a whole, by offering new perspectives that will<br/>facilitate the development of new geochemical and GIS techniques. Enhanced collaboration with IRD<br/>supports a productive and visible international, interdisciplinary scientific partnership. For example, our<br/>previous collaborative research with IRD resulted in new understandings of mercury contamination<br/>dynamics within riparian food sources to indigenous human populations. The PIs have a record of public<br/>outreach, and this project will generate data products useful to educators and researchers, including our<br/>own teaching and public presentations to both scientists and general audiences. Furthermore, this will<br/>provide valuable research experience to many undergraduate and some graduate students in the USA and<br/>South America, including funds for these students to publish and present results at meetings.<br/>"

Livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in Central Asia, and pastures of the Tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population.  Grasslands on the Tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded.  Causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife.  Prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors.  As a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness.  This interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses.  The investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments.  In addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified.  Each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face.  These data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists.  The models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.<br/><br/>This project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status.  Because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental.  Enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide.  In addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of Tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials.  Direct collaboration with Chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers.  Direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.

Emissions estimates will be corroborated using independent information sources for emissions and ambient concentrations, and these will be combined to assess and characterize the uncertainty in model predictions. International comparisons of metals use, reuse and recycle rates in Canada and Japan will provide insights into the magnitude of problems and possible material management strategies.  These next generation LCA models will permit steady-state supply chain, releases, uses and recycling flows of heavy metals to be identified at the individual product level up through the industrial sector level. The models will also provide estimates of changes in heavy metal flows due to new technologies, growth in economic activity and changes in mix of economic activity. Scenarios leading to long-term sustainable materials use will be identified involving both new technologies and management strategies. With comparison to multiple datasets and simulation results, the data and model uncertainty will be identified and characterized.

This BE/MUSES research is designed to address these issues through efforts of an interdisciplinary team, consisting of a polymer chemist, a chemical engineer, a public health researcher, and two social scientists,  employing complementary methods to study health protective textiles. In particular, a thorough investigation of the physical, sociological, economic, life cycle, health risk, and environmental impacts of disposable and reusable protective textiles in healthcare facilities and other contexts will be conducted.  Protective textiles in the medical sphere include surgical gowns, gloves, drapes, and facemasks; these may be disposable or reusable. The selection of reusable and disposable textiles is determined by many factors, such as costs, protective and comfort properties,  government regulations, and social and psychological perceptions of both textiles. We are interested in the acceptance and potential impact of new medical textiles in the healthcare and other arenas related to biological and chemical protection. The specific objectives of the research are: (1) to determine the most effective, multi-functional (biocidal and water-repellent) materials for medical applications; (2) to quantitatively assess the economic, environmental, and health risk reduction impacts of using these textiles in the healthcare industry; (3) to determine the social and psychological factors affecting the acceptance of new material by healthcare workers; and (4) to educate healthcare workers, patients, and the public.

If emissions continue to rise unabated for the next three centuries, an additional 4000 PgC or more will be input to the atmosphere and ocean. Published model simulations of the ocean/atmosphere response to the eventual complete utilization of fossil fuels indicate that atmospheric CO2 will rise to levels that Earth likely hasn't experienced for at least 40 million years, and the surface ocean may undergo acidification to the extent that corals and other calcifying organisms will be unable to precipitate their skeletons. <br/>Confidence in and refinement of these model simulations will benefit from application to, and comparison with, analogous events in Earth history. Approximately 55 million years ago (Mya), Earth experienced a similar episode of rapid and extreme transient warming, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), likely the product of massive carbon release. Intense study of the PETM over the last five years has led to a far clearer understanding of the consequences of this event on climate, biota, and biogeochemical cycles. One of the more prominent advances is the documentation of evidence for widespread ocean acidification and buffering, consistent with carbon cycle theory.  A related advance was the discovery of second warming and ocean acidification event at ~53 Mya. This event, known as ELMO, was less extreme than the PETM in every sense, from the carbon cycle perturbation to the magnitude of warming. These global warming events, termed hyperthermals, provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into the long-term impacts of rapidly rising CO2 levels on modern climate, ocean carbonate chemistry, and biotas. They also provide an opportunity to identify potential non-linear feedbacks, and test climate and biogeochemical model sensitivity. To this end, an interdisciplinary group of scientists with expertise in carbon cycle dynamics, sediment geochemistry, paleoceanography and paleobiology has been assembled, and will embark on a 4-year project to address critical questions regarding two hyperthermals, and their implications for understanding of the carbon cycle including: 1) what were the mass, rate, and origin of carbon released during the hyperthermals? 2) what were the rates of sequestration and recovery and what biogeochemical feedbacks came into play? and 3) how did associated extreme changes in ocean carbonate chemistry affect planktonic calcifiers? The strategy will involve integration of the observational database with numerical models. The observational database will be used to constrain and test the carbon cycle models. This includes records of biogenic carbonate production, accumulation and preservation in 3-dimensions through the PETM and ELMO.  This will also require substantial refinement of age models. With a highly resolved and multifaceted data set for input, three modeling approaches will be used, each involving specific opportunities and compromises in terms of the time scales and scope of processes that can be modeled. Earth system models (GENIE and CCSM) will provide boundary conditions for the process-oriented models. Process model simulations will be designed to investigate problems identified during data/model validation of the Earth system models and to develop hypotheses to be tested with model simulations.<br/>Broader Impacts: This highly interdisciplinary project will provide important insight into the short-term and long-term fate of anthropogenic CO2 on the global carbon cycle, climate, and biota. Such information is essential to providing scientific leaders and policy makers with a better sense of the consequences of unabated anthropogenic CO2 emissions for global climate, ocean carbon chemistry and marine food chains. Moreover, the project places significant emphasis on a number of closely integrated research and educational activities that will lead to the development and circulation of educational materials related to abrupt climate change and training in how to integrate them in curricula.  In addition, we will take advantage of highly successful existing programs to provide opportunities for undergraduates from under-represented groups to participate in cutting-edge, relevant, carbon-cycle research.<br/>"

Professor Cooper's primary collaborators are Dr. Barrie Peake, University of Otago, Department of Chemistry, and Dr. T. David Waite, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Centre for Water and Waste Technology, University of New South Wales (UNSW.) Other project participants in New Zealand include a U.S. graduate student of Dr. Cooper's who is funded from other sources.<br/><br/>The main focus of the research in New Zealand is the aquatic chemistry of two reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide radical anion, O2- , and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in several distinctly different environments. There are three specific research objectives in New Zealand. 1) To study the effect of depleted stratospheric ozone (i.e. increased UV-B) on surface water photochemistry (i.e. the formation of ROS) in both fresh waters (impounded water reservoirs and running streams) and coastal oceans and estuaries. 2) To continue a study of the variability of H2O2 in rain collected at several sites that was initiated by Dr. Robert Kieber during his sabbatical in New Zealand in early 1999 and to extend these data on rainwater to the concentration of H2O2 in the troposphere in regions of depleted stratospheric ozone.  3) To conduct studies to obtain a better understanding of the relationship of ROS and the production of toxins by phytoplankton during harmful algal bloom. The research in Australia will be a continuation of studies begun by Dr. Cooper during his 2003 sabbatical at UNSW. This work is in the area of kinetic modeling of an Advanced Oxidation Process, ""Fenton's chemistry."" <br/><br/>Scientific Merit<br/><br/>The flux of atmospheric ozone is the focus of substantial attention because of the role it plays in global change. This work will also focus on biologic and non-biologic sources of hydrogen peroxide production; preliminary results suggest that in some cases microbial and algal sources may outweigh photochemical sources.  Improved understanding and modeling of the sources and behavior of reactive oxygen species in aquatic environments may therefore also contribute to work in environmental engineering aimed at relevant pollution abatement procedures.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The collaborative research involves U.S. graduate students as well as a female undergraduate student from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The PI intends that the supported visits will firmly establish and advance several lines of research that will involve long-term collaboration with his new partners in New Zealand and Australian. The PI will prepare a series of lectures on radiation chemistry, ballast water treatment with ozone, and the relationship of ROS and harmful algal phytoplankton. Dr. Cooper and Drs. Peake and Waite have planned an international symposium entitled ""Free Radical Chemistry in the Environment."" It has been accepted for inclusion in the 2005 Chemical Congress of the Pacific Rim (Pacifichem 2005). The initial visit supported by this award will also be used for coordinating the planning of this meeting.

Over the past 2-3 years, there has been significant progress on analyzing the temporal dynamics of interacting hydrologic-ecosystem processes. This research intends to advance these efforts by incorporating spatial variability of these processes and interactions, a key to answering the ""where?"" related questions in addition to the ""when?"" related questions. The proposed research methodology is based on a systems-level stochastic modeling and field experimental framework that has been used by the PIs to aggregate physical, chemical and biological processes occurring at several spatial and temporal scales, quantifying biogeochemical stocks and fluxes as well as providing estimates of their uncertainty. Validation of this eco-hydrological model will be accomplished through proposed field experimental tests in the Everglades (Florida) and Cerrado (Brazil) ecosystems.

In particular, the Annelida, commonly called segmented worms, has been central to debates on the role of segmentation in animal evolution. Recent evidence suggests that several non-segmented or partially segmented worm taxa, that were previously regarded as separate phyla, are within the annelid radiation. These recent results conflict with the only comprehensive phylogenetic analyses to date on the annelids, the morphological analyses of Rouse and Fauchald (1997). Furthermore, because annelids are one of the most evolutionarily successful ""phyla"" and because they diversified in the late PreCambrian to early Cambrian, understanding their early evolutionary history is paramount to understanding the evolution of animal life. <br/><br/> The proposed work has two goals: 1) Genomic approaches will be used to reconstruct the early phylogenetic events of the ""Annelida"", which includes several previously recognized phyla, and 2) Functional genomic techniques will be used to characterize the developmental mechanisms employed in segmentation in several key lineages.  Interpreting the segmentation, a hallmark of annelids, in the context of the phylogeny will allow novel insights on the role and plasticity of segmentation during animal evolution. This project has been called ""WormNet"" because it represents an interdisciplinary network of researchers, at four institutions, focusing on these goals in a manner that enhances education and outreach activities. <br/><br/> Additionally, this program is designed to jumpstart other areas of research in the major metazoan clade Lophotrochozoa (annelids, mollusks, lophophorates, and their allies). Publicly available cDNA and genomic BAC libraries will be produced, and data from approximately 130 completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes will provide needed markers for population genetic and systematic studies. Given that annelids are the most abundant and ubiquitous animal ""phlyum"" in the deep sea (which covers 70% of the planet), serve as bioindicators, have a role in bioremediation, and include up-and-coming model organisms, the importance of understanding their evolution cannot be understated.  <br/><br/>"

The movement of carbon from ancient fossil deposits to the atmosphere and into marine and terrestrial biospheres has many consequences, few of which are currently fully understood or predictable. Much of the needed understanding of the carbon cycle may come from better observational methods that can characterize large spans of time or space. One group of observational methods, autonomous sensors, can provide high temporal resolution data within air, earth or water systems.  In this research, PIs from the University of Montana, Oregon State University and University of Miami will develop and use autonomous sensors to advance our understanding of carbon cycling within the earth's biosphere. With prior support, they have developed sensors for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), pH and total alkalinity that can be used to quantify the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon through thermodynamic relationships. The more recently developed, currently laboratory-based sensors (pH and alkalinity) will be further refined for subsequent deployment, along with the more mature pCO2 sensor, in two contrasting marine environments; the coastal ocean waters off the U.S. central west coast, and a shallow coral ecosystem in Puerto Rico. Field studies will begin with a short, in situ test off Oregon State University's pier in Newport, Oregon followed by deployment on the Oregon shelf to study the processes that control air-sea carbon dioxide fluxes during periods of coastal upwelling. Concurrently, the same sensors will be deployed in La Parguera Marine Reserve, Puerto Rico, a Coral Reef Early Warning System (CREWS) site operated by NOAA to focus on the relationship of calcium carbonate saturation states to calcification rates in a coral reef ecosystem. <br/><br/>The project will have a number of broad impacts including the technological development of rigorously tested sensors that will have a wide range of applications in marine and freshwater research.  Students will be trained in the area of chemical sensor development who will subsequently become the next generation of leaders in this important research area.  Outreach activities related to the grant will create awareness for contemporary carbon cycle issues such as greenhouse gas warming and ocean acidification.  <br/>"

The research project will use rigorous quantitative modeling approaches to study the multiple, interrelated, complex, and often conflicting issues associated with the development of a lignocellulosic biofuel industry in the Upper Great Lakes region. U.S. energy policy should be and is committed to reducing and replacing foreign sources of petroleum with viable domestic alternatives.

Lignocellulose ethanol emits virtually no net greenhouse gases, and it is a renewable resource that regenerates without replanting.  <br/><br/>This project, under the auspices of MTU's Sustainable Futures Institute, joins an interdisciplinary research team from MTU with expertise in ecological economics, natural resource sociology, spatial statistics, geographic information systems, conservation biology, forest and landscape ecology, silviculture, chemical engineering, and mechanical-industrial engineering.  Project outcomes include (1) a feasibility assessment of the viability of a lignocellulosic biofuel industry in the study region, and (2) the development and application of quantitatively based decision support tools that will advance biocomplexity studies and have potential broader applicability for emerging biofuel industries.  Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research.  Innovative informal and K-12 science education activities will target diverse audiences ranging from adult learners to Native American elementary students. The expected societal impact of this research is significant, given that the continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels for transportation is unsustainable in the long-term, and this biofuel may provide one alternative to effectively diversify the energy supply of the future.  <br/>"

Approximately 25% of the world's soil organic carbon reservoir is stored at high northern latitudes in permafrost and seasonally-thawed soils in the Arctic, a region that is currently undergoing unprecedented warming and drying, as well as dramatic changes in human land use. Understanding how changes in annual and inter-annual ecosystem productivity interact and potentially offset the balance and stability of the Arctic soil carbon reservoir is of utmost importance to global climate change science. If there is a net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases (namely CO2 and CH4), greenhouse warming could be enhanced. This non-linear, potentially positive feedback response could very quickly cause Arctic terrestrial ecosystems to function in a manner not known to us from the late Holocene and with globally significant implications.<br/><br/>The activities in this research benefit from a foundation and wealth of international and national carbon cycle research undertaken in northern Alaska and other Arctic regions over the past three decades. The group will initiate a comprehensive study involving an integrated framework of multi-scale aircraft and satellite remote sensing, micrometeorological and CO2 and CH4 flux measurements and hydro-ecological process model simulations over a 350km North-South transect spanning the dominant Arctic topographic and land cover units of northern Alaska. The study region encompasses many long-term measurement sites that have been in place for 5 to 10 years. They will expand these observations to include an extensive soil moisture manipulation involving a 60 hectare tundra flooding/draining experiment near Barrow Alaska on the Arctic Coastal Plain. The objective of this study is to quantify linkages between soil moisture and carbon uptake, storage and release over multiple spatial (microbial to landscape) and temporal (minutes to decades) scales. Only by increasing the spatial extent of our experimental manipulations and the duration of our observational time series can we better understand and predict the effect of scale on the complex coupling within Arctic ecosystems; namely, how small scale processes participate as components of higher scale phenomenon and how higher scale phenomenon constrain the former lower scale processes. This knowledge will improve our understanding of the current behavior and potential response of arctic tundra to global change, resulting in better predictions of feedbacks to climate and the global carbon cycle. <br/>"

Hybrid technology provides an excellent opportunity for reducing vehicle emissions as they typically obtain twice the fuel economy of their non-hybrid counterparts, with emission reductions generally greater than a factor of two due to the unique hybrid vehicle-operating environment. Hybrid vehicles can utilize a wide range of fuel and powerplant options that require a widely varying degree of infrastructure investment. The unique aim of this study is the evaluation and prioritization of these factors with expansion into new areas including environmental life cycle analysis (LCA) from fuel production to end-use, consideration of the effect of limited fueling infrastructure on transportation patterns, pollution dispersion analysis and their relation to urban growth. This optimization will vary according to regional characteristics and will be considered for two illustrative locations, the Denver Metropolitan area as well as a mega-city in a developing nation.  Total environmental impact will be considered from cradle-to-grave, from fuel production to efficient end usage. The implementation of hybrid vehicles powered with alternative fuels is critical in addressing the increasingly detrimental environmental and human health impacts associated with increasing petroleum usage worldwide, sustaining the national economy, and on reducing national dependence on imported crude oil. The objective of this planning project includes development of a multidisciplinary team with a diverse background in fuel cell technology, powerplant performance potential, renewable energy and fuel production, environmental and impact assessment, urban planning and simulation, traffic simulations, and geographic information systems. This provides a valuable opportunity for integration of systems analysis in engineering education, while the importance of alternative fuels and vehicle technology provides an effective means of attracting potential students to the engineering field. Specific details of integration with engineering education will be considered in this planning project. The project will be jointly managed by Rober Wellek in CTS and Juan Pestano in CMS.<br/>"

Phytoplankton photosynthesis, export of organic carbon from the surface layer and remineralization of that carbon in the deep sea comprise a biological pump, which transports CO2 from the atmosphere to the deep ocean at globally significant rates. Ice-core records suggest that oscillations in the global-<br/>scale efficiency of this pump may play a major role in controlling atmospheric CO2 concentrations on glacial/interglacial time scales. Because N, P, Si and Fe availability are all known to limit organic matter production by phytoplankton or its export to depth in present-day ocean habitats, limitation by those elements may be the main biogeochemical mechanism regulating atmospheric CO2 levels In several large oceanic areas high surface concentrations of nitrate and phosphate persist throughout the year, suggesting Fe limitation of phytoplankton growth and/or Si limitation of diatom growth. In those high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) areas, relatively little of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) delivered to surface waters is taken up, making the system either a greater source<br/>or smaller sink for atmospheric CO2 than it would be if all N and P were used. Two HNLC systems are of the greatest global importance with respect to these processes: In the Southern Ocean, glacial/interglacial changes in Fe supply may stimulate phytoplankton photosynthesis during glacial periods and limit it during interglacials, driving the well-documented changes in atmospheric CO2. In the Pacific Ocean, wind-driven upwelling at the equator and inefficient use of the upwelled N, P and DIC by phytoplankton combine to make the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) the largest oceanic<br/>source of CO2 to the atmosphere under present conditions. There is now direct experimental evidence of both Fe limitation and Si limitation in HNLC surface waters. In addition, diatoms (the only major phytoplankton group that requires Si) are usually stimulated more than other groups by release from Fe limitation. Fe and Si availability can also interact to control the production and export of organic matter in HNLC areas because low [Fe] increases the Si/C and Si/N uptake ratios of diatoms. This project will undertake a coordinated program of field research, biogeochemical modeling and education focused on the roles of Fe limitation, Si limitation and zooplankton grazing<br/>in regulating the carbon cycle in HNLC areas. The experimental work and modeling will both stress effects of these control mechanisms on three functional groups within the phytoplankton -- diatoms, coccolithophores and picoplankton -- whose nutrient requirements differ significantly and which produce organic matter that has distinctly different fates in the ocean. The educational phase of the project will address both the Southern Ocean and the equatorial Pacific, the research phase will be conducted in the upwelling zone of the EEP (135 - 140 W). This research will combine field observations, manipulative field experiments and biogeochemical modeling, with all field observations and experiments designed to support a new generation of upper-ocean models that distinguish explicitly among the roles of diatoms, coccolithophores and picoplankton in the oceanic carbon cycle. The experiments and models are designed to examine competition among these groups under different nutrient regimes, their selective removal by zooplankton and the effects of changing light and nutrient conditions on their elemental composition. These interaction terms have not been explored well enough in previous models to address their effects on carbon cycling in any ocean system.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: An integral part of this project is an educational program for elementary and high school teachers, focused on ocean biogeochemistry, the global carbon cycle and their connections with global climate. The program's goal is to help teachers present these topics to their classes in an accurate and engaging way, leading to real understanding. Three workshops for teachers will illustrate physical and biological controls on the oceanic carbon cycle, explain the global-scale consequences of changes in that cycle and develop instructional materials for the teachers to use. Those educational tools will include an interactive web site where teachers and students can run biogeochemical models of the EEP, make their own assumptions about how the system might work and use the model to explore the consequences of those assumptions. In addition, one teacher will go on each cruise to experience seagoing research first-hand and interpret the results for students. There will also be a significant international collaboration with scientists at l'Institut Universitaire Europen de la Mer (IUEM) in Brest, France in both the seagoing and modeling phases of this project.<br/>"

To achieve these objectives, representative samples of suspended particulate matter will be collected from all three rivers and from floodplain deposits to quantify the magnitude and composition of the POC load over a wide range of discharges. Event-response sampling of sediments from both the floodplains and continental margins following floods will provide insight into short-term carbon burial patterns.

We will combine these data to investigate the magnitude and frequency of events associated with the delivery and burial of different types of carbon across the land-ocean continuum. Our results will be up-scaled to the entire US West Coast margin by integrating them with data sets from USGS gauging-stations, NOAA ocean-buoys and NWS meteorological stations. <br/><br/>The broader significance and importance of the work resides in the fact that small, mountainous rivers account for >50% of global transport of particulates to the ocean and dominate the west coast of North America. However, in spite of their global and regional importance, a quantitative understanding of how carbon is transported from high-relief basins and buried on coastal margins is lacking. By focusing on how delivery and burial vary as a function of river discharge this research will forge a unifying link between hydrology and oceanography. Through our event-response sampling, we will develop novel approaches to assimilate the ever-increasing flow of information from real time monitoring stations on land and in the ocean. Lastly, the flux of material through river basins under changing hydroclimatic conditions and land-use practices has widespread societal relevance.

This study will examine the social, economic, and spatial dimensions of vulnerability in a Mongolian pastoral population. The natural hazards faced by Mongolian herders include local fluctuations in rainfall, the disastrous combination of summer drought and winter cold and snow, called dzuud, availability and quality of forage, animal diseases, and fire. These natural hazards combine with emerging social and economic stresses, including: conflicts over pasture (especially near market centers, water, and desirable winter pastures), failure of market institutions, animal theft, emerging social inequality among herders which impairs customary patterns of resource management, and shortages of labor created by rural-urban labor migration. This study will identify the main biophysical and social environmental challenges or risks that affect Mongolian herders in this new political economic context, discover the strategies used by communities and households to manage this risk, and determine whether these strategies buffer or mitigate environmental risk sufficiently to maintain household well-being across a population. The study design employs a combination of geographic, economic and anthropological tools, with an emphasis placed on the spatial distribution of local-level risk management strategies and vulnerability to environmental hazard. The main outcome variable, household well being, will be measured multi-dimensionally, and will include food security, nutritional adequacy, maternal and child health status, and self-reported health status. Geographic, social, economic, and meteorological data for all of Mongolia's rural counties will be used to measure county-level vulnerability and the level and severity of climatologic stress (drought and cold). Analysis of these data will be undertaken to identify regions of high and low vulnerability, and high and low hazard risk. From these regions a random sample of 240 households from 12 counties, stratified by vulnerability and hazard risk and distributed across Mongolia's main geographic regions, will be studied. Household-level investigation will focus on microeconomic behavior; adaptive strategies, including, social networks, perceptions of risk, common resource management practices, and inter-household cooperation; and indicators of household well/ill-being, including food security, nutritional status, child growth and development, and self-reported health status. Study findings will add to the social scientific scholarship on the impact of natural hazards on pastoralism as it is practiced in the global economy. In addition, the new knowledge on the interaction of climate stress and vulnerability in producing ill-being is of significant broader interest to service providers, development specialists and climate change researchers. The results of this study will thus contribute to understanding the human dimensions of climate change. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering."

The strongest region of CO2 uptake in the north Pacific is at the subtropical subarctic front. Although thermodynamic processes primarily control the air-sea CO2 flux in the subtropics, biological and physical mechanisms are much more important at the front and in the subarctic Pacific. Based on current understanding, it is uncertain whether alterations to these physical and biological processes in response to climate change could transform the north Pacific into a stronger source or even into a sink for anthropogenic CO2. <br/><br/>In this research, PIs from the University of Washington and Oregon State University, in close collaboration with scientists from NOAA's Pacific Marine Ecosystems Laboratory, will conduct field studies combined with satellite observations and a modeling investigation to identify the mechanisms controlling the air-sea CO2 flux at the subtropical subarctic front and in the eastern basin of the subarctic Pacific. The field studies comprise three separate components: (1) measurement of pCO2 and oxygen isotope tracers of biological productivity (delta17O, O2/Ar) using a Volunteer Observation Ship (VOS) that crosses the Pacific every other month; (2) determination of carbon fluxes and depth distributions not possible from a VOS using a research cruise between Hawaii and Seattle, and (3) in situ, continuous measurement of T, S, O2, chlorophyll, pCO2 and pH on a surface mooring in the eastern subarctic Pacific at Ocean Station P while simultaneously measuring the four dimensional distribution of T, S, and O2 using a Seaglider survey of the area. These autonomous measurements are focused on identifying the role of intermittency in the biological pump. The field observations will be placed in context by a study of satellite products that identify the role of intermittent forcing (e.g. sea-surface height, atmospheric dust levels) and subsequent productivity events (e.g. ocean color, coccolithophorid blooms). A circulation model of the north Pacific that includes modules for the biological ecosystem and the carbonate chemistry will be combined with the field and satellite data to help distinguish the importance of physical and biological processes in controlling the pCO2 of surface waters at the frontal region.  <br/><br/>The most obvious broader impact is the participation of 10 - 15 undergraduate and graduate students on a research expedition between Hawaii and Seattle as part of a course for students of Oceanography at the University of Washington. This research will also support two and one half graduate students who will use the data derived here to complete their Ph.D. research.

There are no major inlet streams and no surface outlet. External inflows of nutrients to the lake are low and dominated by precipitation and dry deposition from the atmosphere. Thus, the lake is ultra-oligotrophic and one of the clearest bodies of water on the earth.

Dick PI, Oregon State University, Corvallis OR<br/><br/>Soil degradation in relation to desertification of Sub-Sahelian Africa is a major concern.  Farmers of semiarid land are being considered to be paid for practices that sequester C in soils, which could enable farmers in vulnerable ecological landscapes to adopt practices that promote sustainability and improve soil quality and degraded environments.  However, assessing soil degradation and the potential to sequester C is spatially and temporally complex in this semiarid landscape. In particular, we have identified a largely unrecognized component in the landscape of the vast semi-arid Sahel, namely woody shrubs (Piliostigma reticulatum and Guiera senegalensis) that voluntarily regrow in farmers' fields after the summer cropping season. These shrubs seem to be much more important than trees or other organic inputs such as animal manure at the landscape level in regulating C inputs/sequestration and hydrologic processes. Under current management farmers who cut and burn the shrub biomass each spring are not utilizing this organic matter effectively.  An intriguing ancillary theory is that these shrubs may do ""hydraulic lift"".  This has been documented in other semiarid regions and is the process of water movement from moist subsoil to dry surface layers using root systems as a conduit which can be released from roots to surrounding soil during periods when transpiration ceases (usually at night) This could drive rhizosphere processes in ""dry"" soil such as nutrient mineralization and mobility and possibly provide small amounts of water to shallow rooting crop species during dry periods.<br/>The overall objectives are to (1) quantify annual C cycling and storage, water balance, and litter decomposition of two dominant shrubs of Sub-Sahelian agroecosystems; (2) couple indigenous knowledge to biogeochemical and hydrological results with the ecology of these shrubs; and (3) use modeling to determine the effect of alternative shrub management systems on soil C and soil quality at the landscape level.  The work has implications for large areas of Sub Sahelian West Africa that have similar agroecosystems to Senegal.  The approach will be multidisciplinary and the ecological research of these shrubs would be a basis for practical applications in agricultural nutrient and water management, and as a viable management tool to off set soil degradation and promote C sequestration to reduce global climate change.<br/>"

Most of these peatlands ( ca. 384 million ha) are found in Russia, the Baltic Republics, Fennoscandia, Alaska and Canada.  In terms of the global C cycle, peatlands represent a major C pool, yet it is unclear whether they function as sources or sinks of atmospheric C, although Gorham's (1991, 1994, 1995) estimates that northern peatlands represent a net sink of atmospheric CO2 (76 Tg C yr -1 ) an a net source of atmospheric CH4 (46 Tg C yr -1 ) remain widely cited. Although the central importance of peat microbial populations as mediators of both aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, including the production of both CO2 and CH4, has long been recognized, little is known about the linkages between microbial community structure and C cycling in peat. Recent developments in molecular ecological techniques now permit quantitative characterization of microbial (Archaeal, eubacterial, and fungal) community structure in peat, so that we can begin to link microbial community structure to ecosystem function, the overall goal of this proposal. <br/><br/>In this proposal, researchers at Villanova University seek to integrate quantitative biogeochemical approaches, quantitative molecular ecological approaches, and education and training of students in striving to understand how microbial community structure related to carbon cycling at the process level in peatlands that appear to be responding to global change on two separate continents.  They will collect intact 1-m long peat cores from the discontinuous permafrost areas of both continental western Canada and central Siberia, the latter with the technical and logistical assistance of colleagues at the Siberian Research Institute of Peat. At 10-cm depth intervals in each core, they will quantitatively evaluate various aspects of ecosystem function including CO2 and CH4 production potentials, activities of process-specific soil enzymes (phenol oxidase, chitinase, acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase), concentrations of low molecular weight dissolved organic anions (acetate, lactate, proprionate, formate, pyruvate, oxalate and tartrate), and bacterial and fungal biomass (using muramic acid and ergosterol assays). In addition, they will use total peat genomic DNA extractions, PCR amplification, plasmid cloning and sequence analysis to identify specific Archaeal, eubacterial and fungal ""species"" in each peat sample. Using this approach, the investigators expect to be able to link microbial community structure to peatland ecosystem function in peatland regions where permafrost is actively melting, possibly representing a harbinger of climate change.<br/><br/>"

The biological pump, most importantly the phytoplankton bloom occurring each spring, drives this uptake. Previous studies have shown the importance of small temporal and spatial scales, i.e. ecosystem patchiness, during the bloom, but have had limited success in resolving these scales due to the inherent limitations of ship-based research.  Recent advances in autonomous platforms and sensors now enable new approaches to sustained measurement of key quantities and rates that have potentially broad impacts.  In this research, PIs from the University of Washington and the University of Maine - Orono, propose a process experiment focusing on an important component of the oceanic carbon system - the North Atlantic Spring Bloom - both for its intrinsic merit and as a test-bed for developing the strategies and knowledge needed to successfully use these new methods to drive the next generation of ocean observations. <br/><br/>The PIs will use Lagrangian floats to follow water parcels in the mixed layer, with each float coupled with roving gliders to characterize its surroundings.  The floats and gliders will measure - in three dimensions over time - the vertical and horizontal mixing rates, and key carbon system components and rates. Phytoplankton and organic carbon will be quantified through a suite of optical proxies, oxygen by two different sensors, and nitrate by UV spectrometry. Redundancy of sensors, reference measurements at 250-1000m, cross-checking among platforms and water sample analysis on three cruises will be used to maintain and verify the calibration of the autonomous sensors. Two-way communication via Iridium satellite will allow sampling strategies to evolve in response to observed conditions. Measurements will be made near 60 degN from late March 2008, before the bloom, through early July when it has ended.  Primary productivity and carbon fluxes will be calculated from changes in inventories of oxygen, nitrate and biomass proxies corrected for the effects of horizontal and vertical mixing. Systematic comparison of these data with a bio-physical ecosystem model guided by adjoint analysis will be used to evaluate the appropriateness of such models for predicting both small-scale patchiness and net carbon uptake through the evolution of the bloom. <br/><br/>The most important broader impact will be on the technology of ocean carbon system measurement as described above.

This project will study a community at the level of its metabolic network in order to develop and test ecological models for community resilience and function.  The approximately five member community is derived from a subsurface extreme acid mine drainage (AMD) site within an ore body. The environmental geochemistry is simple because the ore deposit is ~95% pyrite (FeS2), and receives minimal inputs of fixed carbon and nitrogen.  Energy is supplied to autotrophs from only two sources: aerobic iron and sulfur oxidation. These and other characteristics make the system tractable to bioreactor experiments and modeling that can document ecosystem structure and function. <br/><br/>Two groups of hypotheses based on established ecological principles will be tested.  First, microorganisms responsible for nitrogen fixation and oxidation of elemental sulfur are hypothesized to be keystone species because their impact on the community is disproportionate to their abundance.  Perturbation studies will be used to test this hypothesis.  Second, iron-oxidizing organisms are hypothesized to be adapted to higher pH conditions.  Microbes colonize pyrite surfaces, and through a series of species succession events, lead to a climax community at an optimal low pH (facilitative succession). The identity and metabolic characteristics of early to late colonizers in bioreactor communities will be determined in a series of eight washout-perturbation treatments in order to test this hypothesis. The central product of this study will be a genome-enabled elucidation of the metabolic pathways that regulate and determine survival of individual species and the community.  Genome data and gene expression will be analyzed to identify and monitor activity of genes responsible for oxidation of ferrous iron (the primary sulfide oxidant) and sulfur (the key acid generating reaction), and CO2 and nitrogen fixation.  Metaphysiological trophic models will be developed to describe the system and test hypotheses.  This modeling technique is particularly adept at handling non-linearities in complex systems.  Outcomes will include the first tests of ecological theories of succession and species interactions with genetic-level resolution, and students trained in the development of new approaches to ecology. <br/><br/>"

Microbes adapted to oligotrophic, low-temperature environments are found in glacial ice, frigid lakes, in permafrost and in cold, deep ocean water and sediments.  Polar ice contains the lowest concentrations, from a few hundred to about 104 cells/cm3, probably transported by wind into the atmosphere, precipitated with snow, and compacted into ice.  The great majority are dormant or dead.  With varying success, cultivation of microbes recovered from ice cores yields colony-forming units in a fraction (~10-4 to ~10-2 ) of dormant cells.  Chemical, physical and biological arguments indicate that as many as 103 microbes/cm3 can extract enough energy from acids confined in narrow liquid veins in otherwise solid ice to survive for a few thousand years (or a smaller population for a correspondingly longer time).

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the feedback relationships between carbon and sulfur cycling and community dynamics in gas hydrate systems in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/><br/>This will be a one-year pilot study involving investigators from the University of Missouri - Columbia, Texas A & M University, and the University of Tennessee.  The first goal is to obtain basic information on the abundance, diversity, and activity of microorganisms, which are poorly understood relative to the geochemistry and to the invertebrate communities in gas hydrate systems. The second goal is to organize two workshops bracketing the research aspects of the project to foster future collaboration. The workshops will enhance dialog between different disciplines and prepare scientists in several fields to address questions at a systems level using interdisciplinary skills. The pilot study will be centered on testing of hypotheses using field and laboratory measurements. The investigators hypothesize that (1) the gas hydrate system harbors a distinct microbial community, which has high population density and high rates of sulfate reduction, hydrocarbon (including methane) oxidation, and H2 S oxidation compared to the normal marine environments; (2) methane oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction below the sediment surface provides reduced sulfur compounds that diffuse upward and serve as the energy source for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria at the sediment or gas hydrate surface where oxygen is available; (3) microbial oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons strongly affects carbonate diagenesis.    The experimental approach includes (1) culture-independent DNA-based molecular methods, lipid biomarkers, microscopic, and radioactive isotope tracer techniques to determine microbial abundance, activity, and species diversity, and (2) stable carbon and sulfur isotope fractionation, and pore-water chemistry to understand the kinetics and mechanisms of element cycles. Results of this project are expected to speak broadly to the evolution of biocomplexity in the marine biosphere given the wide occurrence of gas hydrates throughout geological time.<br/><br/>"

The proposal focuses on the extra tropical cloud systems of the Pacific Ocean, one of the major contributors to the negative global mean net cloud forcing, and examines its role in global and in North American climate change. It will investigate the role of aerosols, particularly dust and soot from Asia, and large scale dynamics in regulating cloud albedo over the Pacific Ocean. Since the extra tropical cloud systems consist of liquid as well as ice phase clouds, the proposed research will open new avenues of research in climate change. <br/><br/>The research consists of two components: <br/>I. Aerosol and Cloud forcing and aerosol-cloud parameterization:   The PI will estimate the vertical distribution of atmospheric radiative heating (or cooling) and surface dimming due to aerosols with a focus on dust-soot mixtures; same for cloud radiative forcing; provide input for anthropogenic and possibly biogenic cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for both low and high clouds on regional scales; develop a regional model with explicit parameterizations for interactions between aerosols, clouds, chemistry and synoptic scale dynamics.  The research consists of three parts:  A. creating an integrated observational data set of aerosol-cloud-dynamics-radiative forcing. The data will include observations from field projects, including high altitude research aircraft data, satellite and surface data;  B. estimating the 3-D structure of the radiative forcing of clouds and aerosols; and, C. developing an aerosol-cloud-chemical-transport-radiation model that accounts for the observed fields and forcing.<br/>II. Climate Impact Studies: Using the data and model schemes developed under Part A, conduct the following impact studies: the effect of long range transport of soot and dust on the Pacific and N. American aerosol loadings, and aerosol and cloud radiative forcing over the Pacific and N America; the effect of aerosol and cloud forcing on Pacific sea surface temperature trends and N American climate; and, the feedback effects of Pacific aerosol-clouds on the past and future climate trends.  This part will employ National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) climate models for estimating the impact on climate change and climate feedback. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts.  The research will generate new integrated 3-D data sets on aerosol and cloud forcing over the Pacific Ocean. Since it will be observationally based, it will be of great use for validating general circulation models' treatment of aerosol and cloud impacts on climate. The forcing estimates and climate impact studies will be used in national and international assessments of human impact on climate. The collaborations with East Asian scientists will be of great value for obtaining reliable data for the Asian region. Lastly, the students and post docs involved in the project will have a unique opportunity to get exposed to a challenging new avenue of research and participate in international collaborations. <br/><br/>"

If emissions continue to rise unabated for the next three centuries, an additional 4000 PgC or more will be input to the atmosphere and ocean. Published model simulations of the ocean/atmosphere response to the eventual complete utilization of fossil fuels indicate that atmospheric CO2 will rise to levels that Earth likely hasn't experienced for at least 40 million years, and the surface ocean may undergo acidification to the extent that corals and other calcifying organisms will be unable to precipitate their skeletons. <br/>Confidence in and refinement of these model simulations will benefit from application to, and comparison with, analogous events in Earth history. Approximately 55 million years ago (Mya), Earth experienced a similar episode of rapid and extreme transient warming, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), likely the product of massive carbon release. Intense study of the PETM over the last five years has led to a far clearer understanding of the consequences of this event on climate, biota, and biogeochemical cycles. One of the more prominent advances is the documentation of evidence for widespread ocean acidification and buffering, consistent with carbon cycle theory.  A related advance was the discovery of second warming and ocean acidification event at ~53 Mya. This event, known as ELMO, was less extreme than the PETM in every sense, from the carbon cycle perturbation to the magnitude of warming. These global warming events, termed hyperthermals, provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into the long-term impacts of rapidly rising CO2 levels on modern climate, ocean carbonate chemistry, and biotas. They also provide an opportunity to identify potential non-linear feedbacks, and test climate and biogeochemical model sensitivity. To this end, an interdisciplinary group of scientists with expertise in carbon cycle dynamics, sediment geochemistry, paleoceanography and paleobiology has been assembled, and will embark on a 4-year project to address critical questions regarding two hyperthermals, and their implications for understanding of the carbon cycle including: 1) what were the mass, rate, and origin of carbon released during the hyperthermals? 2) what were the rates of sequestration and recovery and what biogeochemical feedbacks came into play? and 3) how did associated extreme changes in ocean carbonate chemistry affect planktonic calcifiers? The strategy will involve integration of the observational database with numerical models. The observational database will be used to constrain and test the carbon cycle models. This includes records of biogenic carbonate production, accumulation and preservation in 3-dimensions through the PETM and ELMO.  This will also require substantial refinement of age models. With a highly resolved and multifaceted data set for input, three modeling approaches will be used, each involving specific opportunities and compromises in terms of the time scales and scope of processes that can be modeled. Earth system models (GENIE and CCSM) will provide boundary conditions for the process-oriented models. Process model simulations will be designed to investigate problems identified during data/model validation of the Earth system models and to develop hypotheses to be tested with model simulations.<br/>Broader Impacts: This highly interdisciplinary project will provide important insight into the short-term and long-term fate of anthropogenic CO2 on the global carbon cycle, climate, and biota. Such information is essential to providing scientific leaders and policy makers with a better sense of the consequences of unabated anthropogenic CO2 emissions for global climate, ocean carbon chemistry and marine food chains. Moreover, the project places significant emphasis on a number of closely integrated research and educational activities that will lead to the development and circulation of educational materials related to abrupt climate change and training in how to integrate them in curricula.  In addition, we will take advantage of highly successful existing programs to provide opportunities for undergraduates from under-represented groups to participate in cutting-edge, relevant, carbon-cycle research.<br/>"

Specifically, the PIs will explore the mechanisms through which (1) plant physiology and species dynamics alter cycles of C, N, and H2O, (2) levels and dynamics of C, N, and H2O regulate plant species composition, (3) microorganisms control short-term and long-term N availability, and (4) plant chemical composition regulates structure and function of the soil microbial community. Together, these hypotheses dissect the complex web of feedbacks linking biogeochemical cycles and ecological dynamics. The research builds on the infrastructure and ongoing operations of the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment, a multi-factor, ecosystem-scale manipulation. The manipulations were initiated in 1998 with NSF support and are now supported by the Packard Foundation. They include two levels of temperature, two of CO2, two of N deposition, and two of precipitation, with single-factor manipulations as well as all of the possible 2-way, 3-way, and 4-way combinations.<br/><br/>The team includes biogeochemists, ecophysiologists, population biologists, and microbial ecologists. The project will explore interactions between biogeochemical cycles and species dynamics across a range of time scales, from short-term physiological changes, through changes in species composition that unfold over several generations, to slow feedbacks from changes in soil stocks of C and N. The experiment's large array of treatments, plots that contain thousands of individuals of the dominant plants, and duration of several generations of the key species, provides a unique framework for addressing specific questions about biogeochemical responses to realistic global changes as well as fundamental questions about controls on major biogeochemical cycles. A modeling framework will be used that combines biogeochemistry, species changes, and species effects on biogeochemistry for synthesizing results across the project and integrating those results in the broader fabric of global-change research. This experiment is intended as a model system, where ease of manipulation and rapid responses can facilitate testing mechanistic hypotheses and establishing a framework for generalizing underlying principles to other ecosystems. <br/><br/>The proposed research will have a range of broader impacts. Jasper Ridge provides a core for diverse projects led by students as well as independently funded researchers. Located on university campus in a major urban area, the project is highly visible and widely integrated in Stanford classes as well as organized activities for K-12 students and the general public. It is an effective tool for communicating the nature of global changes, the diversity of their impacts, and the potential of biogeochemistry research. With the funding requested here, we will focus on increasing opportunities for secondary students, with an organized curriculum and internships.<br/>"

Respiration rates are typically challenging to predict under changing environmental conditions, potentially because multiple microbial groups, including fungi, contribute to this process. The objectives of our study are (1) to examine the potential for fungal species to perform different roles in decomposition, and (2) to incorporate these differences in large scale estimates of decomposition following forest fires and N deposition. Specifically, we will examine the hypothesis that saprotrophic fungal species differ in uptake rates of carbon sources, so that ""Ruderals"" quickly acquire labile compounds, while ""Competitives"" primarily rely upon slow, constant uptake of recalcitrant compounds. If this hypothesis is supported, it would suggest a mechanism for resource partitioning among fungal species. We also expect that contributions to decomposition by Competitives will be inhibited under greater N availability, and this reduction will be most pronounced in young fire scars, where recalcitrant substrates are abundant as woody debris. <br/>To address these goals, the proposed work encompasses three major approaches that will be based in boreal forests of Alaska. First, we will perform dual-isotope labeling of mushrooms under field conditions to examine trade-offs that may influence partitioning of substrate use among fungi. A mix of radiocarbon (14C) labeled recalcitrant substrates and 13C labeled labile substrates will be applied to the soil, and a timeline of isotope signatures of CO2 respired from mushrooms of known fungal species will be measured. The release of 14C- versus 13C-labeled CO2 will indicate the extent to which different species use recalcitrant versus labile carbon. The timing of 13CO2 respiration will indicate the rate at which different species can exploit new labile C sources. Second, we will examine natural 14C signatures of fungi to estimate the ages of compounds decomposed by individual species. We expect that Competitives will possess older C than do Ruderals, if Competitives are specializing on more recalcitrant compounds. Third, we will combine information regarding functional roles of fungal species with data derived from surveys of mushroom abundance in natural and nitrogen-fertilized areas along a fire chronosequence in Alaska, in order to estimate effects of shifts in fungal communities on carbon transformations in the soil. We expect that nitrogen additions will reduce the ability of lignocellulose degraders to decompose woody debris generated by forest fires. <br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed work includes an examination of large-scale consequences of shifts in microbial community composition under global change, potentially improving our ability to predict ecosystem responses to the environment. The broader impacts include the development of field-labeling techniques that take advantage of the sensitivity of accelerator mass spectrometry measurements of 14C in order to minimize experimental artifacts. <br/><br/>"

To address this problem, a collection of cloned DNAs representing the messenger RNA populations (cDNAs) of two well-studied cnidarians will be generated. The two organisms that will be used are the freshwater cnidarian Hydra and the colonial marine cnidarian Podocoryne. Bacteria containing the cloned cDNAs will be robotically arrayed to generate archives of the clones. Sequence data will be obtained from approximately 50,000 of the cDNA clones from each organism. The resulting sequence data will be analyzed in various ways using bioinformatic computing tools. The analyses will provide information on what genes are present in cnidarians and how those genes are evolutionarily related to those in animals which diverged more recently than cnidarians, such as vertebrates and insects. Such information will be very valuable for defining the processes by which multicellular animals have evolved. The availability of cloned cDNA sets from two model cnidarians will also make it possible to examine the expression of large numbers of genes in these organisms using the technique of DNA array analysis. In particular it will be possible to identify genes whose expression changes when the organisms are placed under conditions which reflect those present during periods of environmental stress (e.g. elevated temperature).

Our project fosters interactions between experts in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, geochemistry, microbiology, fluids and mass transport, microfabrication and spectroscopy.  For the investigation of complex chemical and physical processes at microbe-mineral interfaces, correlation of in-situ obtained chemical, topographical and optical information is necessary, in order to understand microbial cell chemistry.

Besides mercury/gold amalgam electrodes for detecting Fe2+ production, nano-pH-electrodes will be integrated into scanning probe tips, mapping pH variations at the microbe-mineral interface. Such multifunctional SPM tips will provide simultaneous topographical, optical and (electro)chemical information correlated in space and time down to the nanoscale.  Quantitative mathematical modeling and simulation of the electrochemical and physical processes taking place during the scanning process is essential for fundamental understanding and interpretation of obtained results. The developed multifunctional scanning nanoprobes will be used to determine the mechanism of reductive dissolution of Fe(III) minerals in the presence of FeRB and/or chemical reductants. Dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction is a relatively recent addition to the suite of anaerobic respiratory processes carried out by microorganisms and plays a significant role in global carbon cycling.  Finally, this combined analytical technique can be extended to other environmental microbial processes involving minerals, such as the reductive dissolution of uranium, the precipitation of rhodochrosite and siderite, and the formation of manganese oxides. In addition, multifunctional scanning nanoprobes will be applicable to a wide variety of electrochemically active complex processes in a multitude of relevant fields, such as corrosion/biocorrosion, neurophysiology and cell signaling.<br/>"

In subsurface systems, changes in redox state are often controlled by shifts in the terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) of microorganisms, initi-ated by the delivery of limiting terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate, or sul-fate.  Thus, mixing interfaces between reduced aqueous systems and more oxic ""re-charge"" water, are zones of increased TEAP dynamics.  Despite the well-recognized im-portance of mixing interfaces, few field investigations have targeted these small-scale, transient zones due to difficulties in obtaining hydrologic, geochemical and microbial measurements at relevant spatial and temporal scales.  <br/>This interdisciplinary study seeks to quantify the solute transport, geochemical, kinetic, and microbiological controls on TEAPs at mixing interfaces within a contami-nated aquifer-wetland system.  High-resolution numerical models will be developed to integrate observations, test hypotheses regarding the role of interfaces on the overall re-ducing capabilities of the system, understand processes and guide field/laboratory ex-periments, and evaluate the potential effects of changing hydrologic conditions on the fate and transport of nutrients and organic contaminants.  To accomplish this and test the central hypothesis that maximum TEAP dynamics, including microbial activity and transformation rates, are observed at interfaces due to the delivery of limiting electron acceptors or donors we will perform the following tasks:  1) map and quantify the distri-bution of TEAPs across significant mixing interfaces during various hydrologic condi-tions; 2) conduct in-situ kinetic studies of electron acceptor utilization rates at induced mixing interfaces; 3) identify in-situ changes in microbial community directly related to changes in water chemistry; and 4) integrate measured controls using numerical models and test hypotheses regarding the impact of mixing-interface zones on biogeochemical cycling during variable hydrologic conditions.  Our novel application of existing and re-cently developed tools will make it possible to quantify the complex linkages between small-scale changes in microbial community structure and activity and the corresponding geochemistry.  New and fundamental knowledge of the controls on TEAPs at mixing in-terfaces is expected to improve our understanding of the fate and transport of redox-sensitive species including nutrients and anthropogenic contaminants and thereby im-prove our ability to assess risk and protect drinking water and ecosystem function.  <br/>The findings of this research are expected to be of great value not only to scien-tists searching for improved ways to measure and interpret complex, coupled earth sys-tem processes but also to industry, regulatory agencies, and the general public.  To ensure the broader impacts of this research are widely disseminated we have developed strate-gies to 1) involve students (K-12, undergraduate and graduate) through direct employ-ment, course development, and educator training; 2) attract researchers from other fields through workshops, meetings, and peer reviewed publications; 3) educate the public through widely distributed fact sheets, research site tours and web page design; and 4) increase diversity by encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups.<br/>"

Geologic data from the Paleocene document a methane release at that time which is comparable to the size of the current inventory of traditional fossil fuels (the Paleocene Eocene thermal maximum event, or PETM). The timing of the methane release coincides with deep sea warming which is not radically different from the long-term global warming forecast.  Thus the prospect of an eventual release of methane from clathrate in response to anthropogenic climate change in the future warrants serious consideration.  <br/>The clathrate carbon reservoir contains more carbon than the atmosphere, the biosphere, soils, and fossil fuels combined, but the stability of this reservoir appears precarious.  The physical stability of the clathrates relies on the cold temperatures and high pressures of the deep sea.  Clathrate is buoyant in water, like regular water ice, and is held in the deep sea by the weight of overlying sediment.  The dissolved methane that the clathrate equilibrates with is chemically unstable against oxygen and sulfate in the modern ocean.  In this proposal we show a preliminary model result that on geologic time scales the size of the steady-state clathrate reservoir may be extremely sensitive to the temperature and oxygenation of the deep ocean.  This model combines two previously existing components: (1) the Muds model for early diagenesis of organic matter in sediments, and (2) the Davies and Buffett model of the physics and chemistry of methane clathrate formation.  The model reproduces the present-day estimates of clathrate in the ocean, but predicts almost no clathrates as the ocean temperature is raised by 6C, the condition before the PETM.  The model is able to store enough clathrate in the Paleocene ocean to account for the PETM if we assume a cool and anoxic Arctic ocean.  <br/>This analysis however tells us nothing about the transition from one steady state condition to another, a shortcoming we propose to address.  We will devote particular attention to the structural stability of the sediment column under conditions of methane phase change, by incorporating pore pressure and metastable clathrate behavior into the clathrate model.  <br/>Intellectual Merit: In summary, we propose to characterize the long- and short-term stability of the clathrate reservoir in the ocean as a component of the climate and carbon cycle of the earth. <br/>(1) What is the sensitivity of the steady-state clathrate reservoir to temperature and oxygenation of the deep ocean?<br/>(2) How quickly does the clathrate reservoir respond to changes in forcing?<br/>(3) Under what conditions might we expect catastrophic release of methane, as in the PETM?<br/>(4) Is there a positive feedback between temperature and the clathrate reservoir?  <br/>Broader Implications: Global warming will undoubtedly destabilize clathrate in the future, but the extent and consequences of any possible methane release are not known.<br/><br/>"

Cross-disciplinary and integrated modeling is appealing for evaluating the economic, environmental and social aspects of materials use. However, previous efforts indicate the formidable challenges in developing useful models due to the vastly different scales and uncertainty. Economic models are at a relatively coarse scale, process life cycle assessment is done at an intermediate scale, while engineering models are at a finer scale.  The proposed work will treat LCA as a multiscale statistical data fusion problem, where data and models are available with different degrees of spatial aggregation. The resulting multiscale model will be useful for studying the impact of economic policies on finer scales. This exploratory project will focus on developing the statistical framework, completing illustrative examples and initiating the multiscale life cycle model for gasoline.  Techniques from environmental economics will quantify the externalities during the life cycle of materials use, and will be used to formulate policy alternatives. Furthermore, the proposed educational activities will provide insight into the human response to environmental problems. This will be used to devise effective teaching methods and meaningful socio-economic policies, making this a fully integrated multidisciplinary project.

Feedback between different parts of this web is mediated to a significant degree by the exchange of radiatively important, biogenic trace gases. One such feedback involves marine plankton, the volatile sulfur compound dimethylsulfide (DMS), and global climate. In this feedback, DMS produced by marine phytoplankton and the food web enters the troposphere and is oxidized there to sulfate particles, which influence cloud albedo and, consequently, climate. Large-scale climate change, in turn, affects phytoplankton abundance and food web processes in the oceans and thereby closes the feedback loop. <br/><br/>The strength-and even the sign-of this feedback loop is still unresolved, largely because of the exceedingly complex network of biogeochemical and ecological processes that affect the concentration of DMS. Fascinating new interactions in this cycle are still being discovered with some regularity, but mechanistic and prognostic mathematical models of this system have yet to incorporate many of these developments. Furthermore, there have been no field studies in which all of the relevant rates and concentrations in the marine DMS cycle have simultaneously been measured, nor have complex interactions or measurements been included for important geophysical or chemical parameters, hampering the ability of models to accurately map spatial and temporal variations in surface DMS concentrations. This effort will: 1) Measure and model all known relevant fluxes of concentrations of DMS and related species during intensive field studies in two ocean biomes: a subtropical gyre and the Southern Ocean; 2) Develop a global marine DMS model built upon the proposed field measurements and other existing measurements and models; and 3) Use such a model to evaluate the potential for feedbacks between climate and the marine DMS cycle. <br/><br/>The DMS biogeochemical system represents a tractable research subject that can aid in understanding the complexities involved in biosphere-geosphere regulation at the regional and global scales. The DMS system also serves as an excellent, research- accessible model for food-web dependent biogeochemical processes. This investigation of the complex controls on the DMS  cycle should shed light on the critical factors influencing the ecological distributions of organisms in the sea and the biogeochemical cycles of major nutrient elements. Advancing the knowledge of DMS biogeochemistry will allow better predictions of the local, regional and global scale responses to anticipated shifts of climate, and provide valuable insights into the connections within the biogeochemical-geophysical web that sustains life on Earth. <br/>"

With a highly resolved and multifaceted data set for input, three modeling approaches will be used, each involving specific opportunities and compromises in terms of the time scales and scope of processes that can be modeled. Earth system models (GENIE and CCSM) will provide boundary conditions for the process-oriented models. Process model simulations will be designed to investigate problems identified during data/model validation of the Earth system models and to develop hypotheses to be tested with model simulations.<br/>Broader Impacts: This highly interdisciplinary project will provide important insight into the short-term and long-term fate of anthropogenic CO2 on the global carbon cycle, climate, and biota. Such information is essential to providing scientific leaders and policy makers with a better sense of the consequences of unabated anthropogenic CO2 emissions for global climate, ocean carbon chemistry and marine food chains. Moreover, the project places significant emphasis on a number of closely integrated research and educational activities that will lead to the development and circulation of educational materials related to abrupt climate change and training in how to integrate them in curricula.  In addition, we will take advantage of highly successful existing programs to provide opportunities for undergraduates from under-represented groups to participate in cutting-edge, relevant, carbon-cycle research.<br/>"

This system is dependent on interactions among dynamic, nonlinear physical and biological processes linking water, heat and materials (biota, sediment, and plant-growth nutrients), flux and retention to fluvial landscape change.  Strong interactions between short-duration, high  stream-power floods, channel  and  sediment  movement, increased roughness due to presence of vegetation and dead wood and upwelling of groundwater creates a complex, dynamic distribution of resource patches, which we refer to as the shifting habitat mosaic.  This rnosaic promotes biodiversity and complex food webs that sequester and transform energy and materials.<br/><br/>Using  this conceptual foundation and the implications of two decades of research on  expansive gravel-cobble flood plains in  western USA rivers. we propose a set of working<br/>hypotheses that address emergent  properties  of these and other similar  flood plains.

We have used<br/>satellite data and ecosystem models to show that Western US montane regions contribute<br/>disproportionately to the US carbon sink; we estimated that 25 to 50% of the total continental US<br/>carbon sink, and up to 75% of Western US carbon sink occurs in mountainous terrain. Our<br/>ability to validate these predictions with measurements, or to build on them with improved<br/>mechanistic models, is limited. Although the scaling of biogeochemical processes was<br/>pioneered in mountain watersheds, recent research has focused more on the ""tower footprint""<br/>paradigm than the watershed approach; unfortunately, our current capabilities with tower-based<br/>measurements are not adequate to develop accurate mass balance predictions in complex<br/>topography, and this has diminished efforts to understand biogeochemical fluxes in the<br/>mountains. In this proposal, we develop a ""carbonshed"" approach for the study of the<br/>ecosystem carbon balance of montane landscapes. We define a carbonshed within the same<br/>context as a watershed - a mountainous tract in which the slopes and valleys cause complex<br/>topographic patterns, which directly influence the drainage and accumulation of CO2, as well as<br/>patterns in the redistribution of energy and water, which indirectly influence the exchange of CO2<br/>across the landscape. We make the case that the carbonshed scale is crucial for linking local,<br/>ecosystem-level CO2 fluxes to regional, landscape-level CO2 fluxes.<br/>In this proposal, we present a plan to measure carbonshed CO2 fluxes in the Front Range of<br/>the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Recognizing that direct measurement of carbon budgets<br/>using atmospheric techniques will be impossible in complex landscapes, we focus on modeldata<br/>integration, using measurements to calibrate and constrain models, and models to<br/>interpolate observations. Recognizing also that carbon and water exchange are closely coupled,<br/>especially in this semi-arid Western environment, we focus on linking carbon and water<br/>measurements. We will challenge process models with measurements at multiple time and<br/>space scales, utilizing seasonal to interannual flux measurements, carbonshed scale campaigns<br/>to scale up (10's of km), and regional (1000's of km) airborne measurements. Large fires in<br/>2002 will allow us to make airborne measurements of carbon dynamics in recently burned<br/>systems, a unique test of the upscaling of fluxes in disturbance-based models. The project's<br/>modeling will use a coupled ecosystem-atmosphere model, allowing simulated fluxes to be<br/>translated into concentration patterns for comparison to surface and airborne observations.<br/>The proposal addresses the intellectual merit criteria by 1) identifying a new phenomenon in<br/>carbon science: the tendency for carbon sinks to develop in high-relief ecosystems, as a result of<br/>the interaction of climate with land use patterns, 2) proposing innovative and cross-disciplinary<br/>methods to measure this phenomenon, and 3) assembling a team including biophysicists,<br/>meteorologists, ecologists and educators to study this problem.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The studies will provide training opportunities for two graduate students and two,<br/>postdoctoral students.

Rivers and estuaries are also dynamic systems where terrestrial OC is transformed chemically and isotopically prior to its export to the ocean margins.  The global C budget currently assumes that riverine flux represents the excess of terrestrial ecosystem net primary production over decomposition.  New data, however, show that rivers discharging to the NW Atlantic margin exhibit a broad range in OC ages, from modern to >5,000 yrs B.P., with particulate OC (POC) often being much older than dissolved OC (DOC).  Therefore, part of the OC residing in continental reservoirs on 103-108 year timescales is being remobilized, but the extremely limited dataset precludes quantitative estimates of the transfer of different-aged OC pools from land to the oceans. <br/>A major question to be addressed in this proposal is ""How much OC of young, old, and ancient ages is mobilized in rivers, and is the processing of DOC and POC in specific rivers and estuaries prior to discharge to the ocean dependent on OC ages and source characteristics?"" This will be addressed by examining a regional subset of river/estuarine systems using isotopic (D14C, d13C), organic biomarker (kerogen, microbial fatty acids, plant lignin, and hydrocarbons), and modeling approaches. The systems chosen for study will cover a spectrum of land-use, lithology, size and discharge in the northeastern U.S.  Different stages of the rivers' hydrographs will be sampled to assess the key roles of runoff and residence times as controlling factors.  Results from this project will be important for understanding how land-derived OC fuels the intense net heterotrophy of rivers and estuaries, for constraining the losses of soil OC via river/estuarine transport, and for interpreting the chemical and isotopic signatures of OC in ocean margins due to both OC sources and processing.<br/><br/>"

Invasive plants have dramatically altered many semiarid ecosystems of the western United States, but N deposition may exacerbate the problem. The conceptual framework for this effort is based on complex systems theory, including modeling non-linear, non-equilibrium dynamics to determine thresholds at which N deposition and fire irreversibly change ecosystems ranging from desert to forest. The impacts of N deposition varies as a function of ecosystem proximity to major N emission sources, meteorology, and soil physical and chemical conditions. N emissions in this region originate primarily from internal combustion engines as nitrate, and secondarily from agriculture as ammonium. This project proposes to identify sources of N deposition, describe atmospheric transport of N, quantify rates of deposition across landscapes, and subsequently determine the N supply rate to vegetation. Biogeochemical, hydrological, fire, and landscape transition models will then be used to show how elevated N and fluctuating precipitation affect grass biomass, the fire cycle, and vegetation change in the different ecosystem types.<br/>Methods:  The research will have two major components. First, it will describe N deposition to different ecosystems in the southern California air basin. The hydrological, carbon, and nitrogen cycles will be coupled since together they control the movement of N, and interannual variability in vegetation growth. Researchers will examine the relationships between modeled N deposition and vegetation response from 1982 to the present. They will also model N deposition expected in the future as a result of projected urban and agricultural land use changes, comparing possible impacts associated with three urban development scenarios. Second, they will examine vegetation composition along N deposition gradients and resample historic vegetation plots to determine changes in plant diversity, and use remote sensing to detect large-scale vegetation changes. Researchers will measure N inputs, turnover, and losses in soils, and conduct fertilization experiments in desert, forest, and shrubland ecosystems to determine thresholds of change under increased N loading. Vegetation change will be modeled using fire and landscape transition models. These results will be coupled with the atmospheric model to show the effect on vegetation for several N deposition scenarios in 2018.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This research will have relevance far beyond southern California since the processes of urbanization and N deposition are occurring around the world, and to a range of ecosystems from arid to mesic. This effort will be one of the few to couple biogeochemical and landscape transition models to show how N deposition, variation in precipitation, and exotic invasions promote non-linear changes in different ecosystem types. The research will promote our understanding of complexity theory by comparing four ecosystem types, each responding with its own threshold and emergent properties to N deposition. <br/>Broader Impacts:  The research will examine complex dynamics of landscapes impacted by emissions caused by changing human demographics and population growth. The controls on plant invasions and their further impacts are not well known, so the results of this research will have implications for regional planning efforts and for emissions regulations. The educational and outreach components of the project include working with local programs to educate the public and school children about N deposition, organizing a regional conference on N deposition for land managers, legislators, and scientists, and working with federal, state, and local agencies on Habitat Conservation Planning efforts for sensitive species subject to air pollution and invasive species.  The project will provide research opportunities for a diverse student population, which will be augmented by advanced seminar courses led by an interdisciplinary research team. <br/>"

As an alternate <br/>particulate pathway the microbial loop represents a process where bacteria are able to metabolize a <br/>portion of this DOM and therefore convert DOM to POM.  This conversion of DOM to POM has <br/>been found to be substantial, providing significant energy for higher trophic levels.

However, the spatial and temporal variation of CO2 production and efflux from catchment soils remains poorly understood.  We are just beginning to develop the methods to up-scale from point measurements such as those made by flux towers or respiration chambers to larger spatial scales such as plots or watersheds.  How the primary CO2 forcing factors vary across climatic, environmental, biogeochemical, and topographic gradients needs to be addressed.  In addition, complementary investigation of the topographic controls on C accumulation and the mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) s central to understanding the links between the landscape and the C cycle at the watershed scale.  Many investigations of C allocation and movement focus on atmospheric exchange, neglecting the loss of C in stream water.  Recent work has given us insight into the processes controlling the timing and magnitude of stream water C exports.  We believe that understanding topographic controls and stream-catchment connections are integral to understanding total C flux from catchments.   The concept of biogeochemical similarity, related to hydrological similarity, has been identified as a powerful tool in understanding the spatial patterns of biogeochemical processes.  Our research will test the applicability of this concept for soil respiration and DOC export and will identify the critical set of measurements necessary to quantify the spatial and temporal variability in the first-order controls on soil CO2 production and surface efflux.  This field-derived information will then inform and constrain our model that simulates the variability of these parameters through space and time.  These spatially distributed data are central to simulation of the <br/>production and transport of soil CO2.  By combining extensive field measurements and quantification of the factors influencing soil respiration such as soil temperature, soil moisture, soil fertility, and climatic variables with numerical modeling techniques, this work will provide a way forward for measuring and modeling the extensive but poorly understood exchange of water, C, and energy between soils and the atmosphere.  The objectives of this research are (1) to quantify CO2 efflux and to develop and apply a model of catchment respiration, incorporating soil air pCO2, vertical soil water transport of dissolved CO2, and surface CO2 efflux, (2) to explore the extent to which <br/>topography can be used to explain the variability inherent in the factors driving respiration, and (3) To quantify the topographic controls on the distribution of soil C in the watershed and link C accumulation in the landscape, DOC transport, and stream DOC export at the watershed scale.     <br/>Intellectual merit of the proposed activity This work will provide empirical information and the foundation for development and application of a framework for understanding the spatial and temporal variably of soilrespiration and resultant soil air CO2 concentration, atmospheric exchange, and streamwater C export.   <br/>Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity The inclusion of undergraduates and graduate students in all aspects of research is a primary goal of this work.  Frostburg State University is a predominantly undergraduate institution, and as such, has limited opportunities for undergraduates to obtain research experience.  This research will provide Frostburg students, both now and in the future with experience and opportunities through collaborative linkages made between Frostburg State University, The University of Virginia, and Montana State University (EPSCoR institution).  Students will be integral members of the research team and will be encouraged to take ownership of their contributions through publication and presentation of their findings at national meetings.  This research will enhance teaching activities <br/>(undergraduate and graduate) through inclusion of near real-time data in class exercises and field-based learning.  This work will also strengthen the research infrastructure at Frostburg, helping to advance students and faculty from undergraduate institutions that are underrepresented in the fields of hydrology and biogeochemistry.  If funded, the Big Sky Institute for Science and Natural History has agreed to provide additional support for participation of a graduate student in the BSI Graduate Fellows Program. Under that program, the Fellow would receive training in effective communication of their results to K-12 communities and the public.  The fellows program provides graduate students training and opportunities to communicate science, encourages young scientists to understand their role in disseminating scientific findings to the public, and helps fulfill BSI.s mission of combining current research with inquiry-based learning for people of all ages and all walks of life.  This work will also produce a dataset of soil air CO2 concentrations, efflux, semi-distributed field measurements and simulations of driving factors through time, and links to streamwater C export.  Our datasets will be made freely available on the web to other researchers and can serve as a test data set for models of CO2 production, flux, and streamwater C export.

A number of recent studies suggest that continental runoff increased throughout the 20th century despite a rapid increase in water consumption by humans and their activities. The reason for the increase in runoff remains a subject of debate, though it is commonly attributed to either an increase in precipitation (P) or a decrease in evapotranspiration (ET) over the 20th century.  While the increase in P can be explained by warming trends, the reduction in ET, especially at sub-continental scales, is more complex. The three plausible explanations for reductions in ET are: (1) Less energy and light input due to solar dimming with lower light levels reducing mean stomatal conductance to water vapor (gc), (2) lower gc due to elevated atmospheric CO2, and (3) land-use change to vegetation that consumes less water. The interplay between these three mechanisms can be explored on a number of scales ranging from the ecosystem level to watershed to sub-continental region. Using a combination of ecosystem models and detailed field experiments, we will investigate how solar dimming, increases in atmospheric CO2, and increases in forested area alter water availability and gross ecosystem CO2 exchange in the Southeastern (SE) U.S., a region that is considered among the most productive in the U.S. in terms of carbon sequestration. The SE provides an ideal case study due to rapid afforestation (and reforestation) over the past 100 years and the minor change in precipitation over the past 50 years.  The project's intellectual merit is to elucidate the mechanisms leading to global runoff increases over the past 50 years, and to assess whether runoff time series contain a discernable signal of climate change.  Recognizing that carbon sequestration will play an increasing role in regional and national policy in the future, and that water resources currently play a major role, the broader impact of this project is to contribute the scientific foundation, data, and models that can guide ecosystem valuation for C-H2O tradeoffs upon conversion among land cover types.  The educational benefit of the project is to support two graduate students, providing them with a unique experience in the state of the art techniques in measurement and modeling of biosphere-atmosphere exchange rates while interacting with a broad interdisciplinary team of physical and biological scientists working on water and carbon cycling at Duke University.<br/>"

Previous work shows that the presence of predators in the rhizosphere food web can increase plant growth 50 to 150%.  This project will use mass-isotope and molecular genetic techniques to identify processes involved in regulating these interactions.  Work will be guided by a hierarchical mathematical model designed to predict how increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature influence carbon storage in the rhizosphere.  Linkages between the carbon and nitrogen cycles in soil will be clarified by experiments under different levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature that move the ecosystem to new equilibria.  One importance of this project lies in its contribution to the debate over whether additional carbon from increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be stored in soil.  Other aspects of the work will identify mechanisms that promote plant growth while sustaining beneficial interactions among bacteria, nematodes and mites that prey on nematodes."

This event, known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), had far reaching and significant impacts on global marine and terrestrial ecosystems that ranged from mass extinction of deep sea foraminifera to dispersal and subsequent radiation of plants and ungulates.  The combination of these climatic and biotic perturbations initiated dramatic changes in the planet's biogeochemical cycles that eventually worked to restore equilibrium to the global carbon cycle.  However, the recovery process took nearly 200,000 yrs. We propose a multi-institutional interdisciplinary program to investigate the effects of the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) on the global biosphere and coupled biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients. This project will bring together an international team of experts that includes 11 senior investigators from the US, and 5 from Europe, New Zealand, and China. Building on a foundation of existing work, this study will utilize an array of models to determine the coupling of inorganic and organic chemical processes, to evaluate the relative contributions of these processes in sequestering excess carbon, on short and long-time scales.  Empirical data representing marine and terrestrial systems will be generated and used to constrain and evaluate model results. We will evaluate and test existing hypotheses concerning the nature of first order effects and feedbacks of the PETM perturbation on the biosphere and coupled biogeochemical cycles.  There are many parallels between the events of 55 Ma and the present day in terms of forcing and response.  There are also many differences in the structure of biotic communities and the configuration of continents and oceans. Nevertheless, at a fundamental level, biogeochemical systems and the biosphere would have responded much as they do today.  As such, the PETM provides a unique and, possibly the only, opportunity to investigate the short and long-term effects of abrupt greenhouse gas induced warming on global environments.<br/><br/>"

Global production of concrete drives huge flows of material between natural and human systems. The shear magnitude of this material flow, which exceeds 12 billion tons each year, causes significant societal impacts. For example, concrete-based infrastructure projects require major investments of public capital, trigger enormous greenhouse gas emissions from cement production, and lead to construction-related traffic congestion resulting in pollution and lost productivity. Developments of new materials to supplement or replace concrete to improve the performance characteristics typically do not address the broad economic, environmental, and social consequences. This project will address this shortcoming by developing a novel framework for sustainable design that integrates microstructure tailoring with life cycle analysis. The project explores engineered cementitious composites (ECC) both from a technical design standpoint and from the health, economics, and policy perspectives. <br/>     The project includes micro-scale research on the development of ECC, macro-scale application of ECC to bridge decks, roadways, and pipes, incorporation of recycled materials, measurement of life-cycle impacts, and investigation at different geographic scopes. This work encompasses multi-disciplinary perspectives including civil and materials engineering, geology, environmental health sciences, industrial ecology, environmental economics, and public policy. Among the issues to be explored are the impacts of sourcing alternatives (superquarries vs. smaller mines) and location of infrastructure projects (urban vs. rural, and U.S. vs. China). Given the inherent design complexity, researchers will incorporate uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their quantitative models to ensure that results are sufficiently robust to support effective decision-making in the adoption of new materials. The University of Michigan team will collaborate with researchers at the Tohoku University in Japan, who will investigate the use of CO2 hardening process on the ECC mixes; researchers at Tsinghua University in China who will use the life cycle model to assess sustainability performance of infrastructure systems in China, and Stanford University. Educational outreach will be facilitated through a web-based educational resource compendium, as well as through a series of workshops involving the global partners. It is expected that this MUSES research will have a significant impact on materials use in large, civil infrastructures and will provide tools that will accelerate the adoption of new materials and material substitutions that lower the environmental impact over their whole life cycle.<br/><br/>"

Water diverted into the hyporheic zone has a longer residence time and more interaction with biogeochemically active sediments than water in other flow paths.  Hyporheic flux rates and geochemistry have not been studied in semi-arid intermountain watersheds, transitional in climate between alpine catchments and desert lowlands.  Hyporheic exchange in watersheds in humid regions is enhanced by stream meanders, variable flow rates, and sediment hydraulic conductivity. In water poor regions other geomorphic characteristics, particularly beaver dams, may equally influence hyporheic exchange. <br/><br/>We propose to complete an intensive study of hyporheic interaction and nitrogen uptake potential in an intermountain semi-arid watershed with significant beaver activity.  The study will include field experiments and numerical hydrologic models designed to 1.) identify and quantify hyporheic pathways and fluxes of water and dissolved solutes across the surface-groundwater interface and 2.) identify the causes of hyporheic flux variability.  We will test the hypothesis that in-stream flow obstructions, particularly small beaver dams, particularly enhance the extent of the hyporheic zone along semi-arid streams compared to the effects of other geomorphic and hydrologic controls.   <br/><br/>We will test our hypothesis by inversely modeling a series of in-stream tracer tests to characterize hyporheic storage parameters along various reaches of Red Canyon Creek, Wyoming.  We will use Darcy flux calculations and observations of tracers at near-stream wells to independently test the results of the in-stream tracer tests. We will test the hypothesis that reaches with a greater degree of hyporheic interaction have a greater potential for uptake of nitrate.  Dissolved nitrate will be paired with the conservative tracers during in-stream tracer tests.  Using the rate of decline of nitrate concentrations downstream, measurements of ammonia and other nitrogen species, and an exponential nutrient uptake model, we will quantify nitrogen uptake lengths along Red Canyon Creek and compare these results with hydrologic measures of hyporheic exchange.  Furthermore, we will do microbial investigations incorporating molecular techniques and analysis of the geochemistry of near-stream waters to independently evaluate the degree to which denitrification and nitrogen uptake drives nitrogen processing in the hyporheic zone. <br/><br/>Results of in-stream tracer tests are empirical in nature, and therefore difficult to generalize to other sites.  For this reason, we will use three-dimensional numerical computer models of near-stream flow paths to evaluate the physical processes controlling the aerial extent and flux of water through hyporheic zones. The results of these models will be combined with detailed measurements of stream geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics in a series of multivariate geostatistical approaches to explore what stream characteristics most affect hyporheic exchange in the study setting and in similar order streams elsewhere. <br/><br/>This project will build on the ongoing collaborative relationships between Syracuse University, the University of Missouri's Branson geology field camp, and the Wyoming Nature Conservancy.  Previous collaborations between these institutions have resulted in hydrologic instrumentation of part of the Red Canyon Creek watershed for student research and education in fields from glacial history to ecology.  We will build on this previous work, enhancing the site with instrumentation that will provide research grade hydrologic data at a watershed scale.  Through this project, students from across the Nation studying at the Branson geology field camp will have unprecedented access to a broader range of hydrogeological field experiments at a wider variety of sites within the Red Canyon Creek watershed.  In addition, students from Central Wyoming College, a 2-year community college with a large Native American enrollment, will be recruited to participate directly as summer research assistants for the project.  These collaborations, undergraduate through graduate in level, will potentially have broad educational impact at both the local and larger scale.   <br/><br/>"

Rivers and estuaries are also dynamic systems where terrestrial OC is transformed chemically and isotopically prior to its export to the ocean margins.  The global C budget currently assumes that riverine flux represents the excess of terrestrial ecosystem net primary production over decomposition.  New data, however, show that rivers discharging to the NW Atlantic margin exhibit a broad range in OC ages, from modern to >5,000 yrs B.P., with particulate OC (POC) often being much older than dissolved OC (DOC).  Therefore, part of the OC residing in continental reservoirs on 103-108 year timescales is being remobilized, but the extremely limited dataset precludes quantitative estimates of the transfer of different-aged OC pools from land to the oceans. <br/>A major question to be addressed in this proposal is ""How much OC of young, old, and ancient ages is mobilized in rivers, and is the processing of DOC and POC in specific rivers and estuaries prior to discharge to the ocean dependent on OC ages and source characteristics?"" This will be addressed by examining a regional subset of river/estuarine systems using isotopic (D14C, d13C), organic biomarker (kerogen, microbial fatty acids, plant lignin, and hydrocarbons), and modeling approaches. The systems chosen for study will cover a spectrum of land-use, lithology, size and discharge in the northeastern U.S.  Different stages of the rivers' hydrographs will be sampled to assess the key roles of runoff and residence times as controlling factors.  Results from this project will be important for understanding how land-derived OC fuels the intense net heterotrophy of rivers and estuaries, for constraining the losses of soil OC via river/estuarine transport, and for interpreting the chemical and isotopic signatures of OC in ocean margins due to both OC sources and processing.<br/>"

For no topical rain forest has there been a multi-year integrated study of multiple components of both aboveground and belowground carbon cycling and how they interact with and are controlled by water, nutrients, and climatic factors.  This Biocomplexity project will address these knowledge gaps to bring understand of tropical forest carbon cycling to a new level.<br/><br/>We will build on complementary on-going research in an exceptionally well-studied tropical rain forest (La Selva, Costa Rica) for a first-time integrated study of forest carbon, nutrient, and hydrological cycles.  Our study will contrast the effects of different phases of the ENSO cycle and will compare stands across a broad range of soil fertility levels, thus representative of the fertility levels of many of the world's tropical forests.  The broad range of expertise represented in our team - tropical forest ecology, plant ecophysiology, micrometeorology, forest biogeochemistry, forest hydrology, ecosystem modeling, remote sensing, invertebrate biology - will allow us to together address many interacting aspects of the carbon, nutrient, and water cycles in this forest.  With complementary data from on-going studies at La Selva, this project will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the forest carbon budget than has been attained for any TRF.  Because our studies will be continuous through almost three years and for some data sets build on long-term measurements, we will be able to study how inter-year variation in climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall affect the complex interactions and feedbacks among carbon, nutrients, and water in this ecosystem type.  By studying all of these cycles in concert, through time, and across a strong gradient of soil fertility levels, we will be able to identify and quantify the complex constraints and feedbacks among all these co-varying processes.  We will integrate our findings by developing from our data an empirically-based tropical rain forest version of the ecosystem process model CENTURY.  We will use this model to develop a generalizable, predictive understanding of how TRF currently processes carbon, and TRF carbon balance is likely to respond to the on-going changes in climate.<br/><br/>Broader impacts - Through a many-faceted education program, this project will convey both our research findings and the concepts of Biocomplexity, global change, and ecosystem science, to diverse levels of students decision-makers, and the general public.

The time interval of interest ranges roughly from 500-600 million years ago; it began with the earliest known microscopic animal fossils and culminated with the rapid diversification of marine animals known as the ""Cambrian explosion."" Recent work based on analyses of geochemical data indicates that these evolutionary changes were accompanied by a major dynamical transition in the global carbon cycle. This transition should have been accompanied by increased oxygenation of the oceans. Because the evolutionary innovations themselves should have been favored by increased oxygen concentrations, the Cambrian explosion may have been both a cause and an effect of changes in global biogeochemical cycles.<br/><br/>This project will test the validity of these hypotheses by combining efforts in biogeochemical theory, geologic field studies, organic geochemistry, and evolutionary biology. A new theoretical formulation of the global carbon cycle provides a means of relating changes in the carbon cycle to changes in the isotopic compositions of specific organic compounds that can be extracted from ancient sediments. Changes in biogeochemical cycling inferred from analysis of the geochemical data will then be related to the fossil record of animals and the evolution of algal and other protistan microfossils.<br/><br/>The subject is central to both evolutionary theory and Earth history. The work seeks to specify, for one of the most important intervals in the history of life, how and why environmental change interacted with changes in the biosphere.

While the analytical elements exist for individual consideration of these concerns, environmental tools have seen little practical use in product development.  This limited application derives from the absence of methods putting the environmental analyses into the appropriate engineering, economic and regulatory contexts so that consistent strategies can be devised.  This project focuses on the automobive industry and the product & process development issues arising from the environmental challenges confronting these companies.  The intention is to use this area as a testbed for developing general methods of tying environmental assessment with engineering, economic and regulatory analyses, forming an integrated product assessment tool.<br/><br/>This effort also emphasizes two long-range educational objectives.  One objective focuses on development of interdisciplinary, case-based courses to demonstrate the use of the design tools developed through the proposed research.  The second educational objective is the development of the collaborative capabilities of faculty from disparate fields, including issues of faculty development in these areas.  A key feature of the work is the formation of an interdisciplinary team that includes experts in the broad range of fields necessary to treat the multidisciplinary problem of refining the product development process in a large industrial firm. This planning project is expected to lead to fundamental research on design of alternative processes, systems, and product development structures that optimize the use of materials throughout their life cycles.

The analysis of the acceptance and potential impacts of new materials and technologies that are environmentally benign in the healthcare arena is the longer-term objective. Protective clothing and textiles in the medical sphere include surgical gowns, gloves, drapes, wraps, sheets, covers, and facemasks; these are composed of two different textile materials--disposable and reusable fabrics-that serve primarily to impede the transmission of pathogens in healthcare facilities. Disposables, also called non-woven fabrics, are mostly produced from polyethylene, polypropylene, and their blends.  After usage, they should be immediately disposed of as bio-hazardous materials. In contrast, reusable textiles, such as those comprised of pure cotton fibers and certain polyesters, can be repeatedly used in healthcare facilities. <br/><br/>Specific research tasks include:  (1) to determine the most effective, multi-functional (biocidal and water-repellent) materials for medical applications; (2) to assess the economic and environmental impact of using reusable biocidal textiles in the healthcare industry; (3) to determine the social and psychological factors affecting the acceptance of the new technology by healthcare workers. Educational activities include a) involving undergraduate and graduate student in the research and to incorporate the research results into a senior undergraduate course; b) providing educational materials to workers in healthcare community and other hazardous Cupertino as was as to manufacturers of textile materials; c) educating the public about the environmental and economic impacts as well as protective properties of the different textile materials in healthcare facilities.

Based on preliminary data, this process appears to occur at a localized horizon (cm's thick) where there is a microbial syntrophic relationship between anaerobic oxidation of methane by archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria.  They will study sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin using high-resolution pore water measurements to create models of the chemical gradients and calculate diffusive flux values.

Stated as hypotheses, the proposal suggests: 1) extensive<br/>Andean hillslope failure and channel migration during large La Nina associated storms mobilizes vast<br/>quantities of fresh organic matter and sediment with low organic carbon (OC) content ; 2) within the<br/>river, mineral surfaces acquire normal OC loadings via sorption as they are rapidly evacuated from the<br/>mountainous source basins to adjacent foreland depocenters; and 3) deposited sediments preserve ""fresh""<br/>carbon within organo-mineral complexes and by deep burial in point bars and ""crevasse-splay"" deposits<br/>that have little potential for exchange with the biosphere and atmosphere. Calculations presented in the<br/>Project Description (C.1.2) suggest that this process could sequester ~ 300 Mtonnes of carbon per event in<br/>the Amazonian foreland. When extrapolated globally to other humid tropical regions, these estimates are<br/>equivalent to 50-100% of the average annual ""missing carbon sink"" or 50-100% of atmospheric CO2<br/>anomalies typically observed during La Nina.<br/>To explore these hypothesis, proposers will study 1) the rates and mechanics of sediment<br/>mobilization, transport, and deposition of river sediment during extreme events, 2) the associations of<br/>organic carbon with sediments at erosional and depositional sites, and 3) the transfer of OC from rapid<br/>(<5 y) to slower (>50 y) turnover pools, via sorption and deep burial processes. We will employ a<br/>combination of GIS analysis of satellite images to map changes associated with individual large storms<br/>(hillslope failures and river migration); field surveys of sediment transport processes; and laboratory<br/>analysis of archived and newly collected samples to determine organic carbon concentrations, sources and<br/>turnover times; sediment characteristics; and transport/deposition timing and rates (geochronology).<br/>The proposed project is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, multi-national research effort that<br/>builds upon a record of prior and current NSF-funded results of decadal-scale sediment fluxes and organic<br/>carbon dynamics within river basins of the Amazon. In close coordination with sediment-flux,<br/>geochronological, geochemical, and process-mapping (GIS) studies conducted by scientists from Univ. of<br/>Washington, scientists at Stroud Water Research Center and Univ. of California Davis will investigate the<br/>quantities, sources, and sequestration of organic carbon mobilized during by these geomorphological<br/>processes. In addition, this project benefits from a close working collaboration with the French Institut de<br/>Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD), with whom we will conduct fieldwork in the Andes and<br/>foreland basins of Bolivia and Peru during both the dry and wet seasons. Additional collaborations are<br/>with the Univ. Nacional Agraria La Molina (UNALM) and the Univ. of California Santa Barabara. These<br/>continuing international collaborations offer considerable scientific and logistical advantages and cost<br/>savings for this current proposal to study the carbon transported and deposited by extreme storm events.<br/>If this research effort substantiates the primary hypothesis, such continental-scale, climate-driven,<br/>erosion-sedimentation processes will be demonstrated to represent substantial, previously unrecognized<br/>natural carbon sinks of global significance. Furthermore, these processes could potentially result in the<br/>sequestration of similar quantities of carbon by anthropogenically accelerated erosion-sedimentation.<br/>Additionally, this research benefits anyone interested in the geochemical processes of organic carbon<br/>preservation in sediment and soils or the timing/rates/mechanics of landsliding, sediment transport,<br/>channel-floodplain interaction, and sedimentary basin dynamics during extreme, ENSO-orchestrated<br/>floods.<br/>The strong bridging between the disciplines of geomorphology, biogeochemistry and organic<br/>geochemistry has broader impacts on earth science as a whole, by offering new perspectives that will<br/>facilitate the development of new geochemical and GIS techniques. Enhanced collaboration with IRD<br/>supports a productive and visible international, interdisciplinary scientific partnership. For example, our<br/>previous collaborative research with IRD resulted in new understandings of mercury contamination<br/>dynamics within riparian food sources to indigenous human populations. The PIs have a record of public<br/>outreach, and this project will generate data products useful to educators and researchers, including our<br/>own teaching and public presentations to both scientists and general audiences. Furthermore, this will<br/>provide valuable research experience to many undergraduate and some graduate students in the USA and<br/>South America, including funds for these students to publish and present results at meetings<br/>"

We know a great deal about the metabolic diversity of bacteria, and the pathways of the reactions they perform. Outside of simple laboratory systems, however, we cannot predict with any certainty the rates at which bacteria grow, metabolize, and mineralize organic matter. This project  is about understanding, at a mechanistic and thus quantitative level, what affects the activity of bacteria in nature. While initially the problem seems straightforward, the investigators believe that its solution has been elusive because there are complex processes involved. This complexity exists over several levels of biological organization (individual, population, community), and in the microscale spatial heterogeneity of the environments in which bacteria function.   The ultimate goal of this study  is to develop, and test, a model that will predict the rates of organic matter cycling in natural systems. Such a model must include the physical and chemical factors controlling the availability of resources (reactants) to bacteria, interactions (potentially competitive) among different bacterial populations, and interactions among bacteria and their predators. The shorter-term goal, and the explicit goal of this project, is to focus on one type of environment - estuarine sediments - and one category of organic matter - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a background of natural organic matter. <br/><br/>The approach centers on a tight coupling between modeling and empiricism, since it is our belief that models and experiments lead to new, useful knowledge only when there is a steady interaction. The model we will develop considers both bottom-up (e.g., resource availability) and to-down (e.g., predation) controls on bacterial activity.  Estuarine sediment will be used as the environmental matrix for modeling and experimental testing inasmuch as these sediments are inherently complex and heterogeneous due to their widely varied chemical and physical properties, the mixtures of organic and inorganic constituents of which they are composed, and the simultaneous occurrence of chemical, physical, and biological processes.   Bicyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) will be chosen as a type of reactant that is used by only certain types of bacteria in the system. Thus, the time rate of change in PAHs will be used as a barometer of the activity of some members of the community. This will provide a sensitive and specific comparison of model predictions and experimental data. Models will be structured to account for variability in properties of the biological and abiotic components. The framework of the models will include spatial heterogeneity in sediment properties, population dynamics including competition and predation, nutrient and PAH mass transfer, and molecular dynamic simulations. Complexity will be added incrementally, as indicated by closely coupling model predictions with experimental results. The expertise of the group assembled to conduct the proposed research encompasses ecology, engineering, environmental geochemistry, and microbiology. <br/><br/>Educational and training opportunities, on a variety of levels, will be built into this research. Specifically, the project will include mechanisms to enhance coursework in both undergraduate and graduate programs in environmental technology and engineering education; to broaden student research training that will explore dynamic interactions within and among environmental systems and will be directed by a multidisciplinary team of faculty investigators; and to provide enrichment opportunities for in-service teachers of science courses in grades 5-8 through a partners-in-learning program.<br/><br/><br/>"

However, like most other microbial metabolic rate measurements in aquatic environments, ectoenzyme activity measurements have usually been limited to manual assays with discrete water samples. An instrument for continuous underway measurements of microbial enzyme activities using high-sensitivity fluorescent substrates has recently been developed. This instrument has been used aboard ship to map the ectoenzyme activities alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase in the surface waters of the Mississippi River plume. With this instrument these enzyme activities can be mapped in much the same way that temperature, salinity, phytoplankton fluorescence, and other parameters are mapped from a research ship while underway. However, this system is limited to horizontal mapping of water samples continuously pumped from the surface and requires frequent operator intervention.  This Biocomplexity Instrumentation Development for Environmental Activities (IDEA) project will take the next much larger step. The research and education team includes a microbial ecologist (Dr. J. Ammerman) and a geochemist (Dr. G. Klinkhammer), both of whom have interests and expertise in sensor development, a coastal physical oceanographer and modeler (Dr. R. Chant), and a non-faculty education specialist (Mr. E. Simms).  The goal of this project is to develop a remotely operated instrument for measurement of microbial enzyme activities and to deploy it at the Rutgers University Long-term Ecosystem Observatory at 15 meters depth, called LEO-15, for periods of weeks to months. This instrument is called the Multiple Enzyme Analyzer (MEA), and should be capable of the simultaneous measurement of up to four different enzyme activities. A simple mooring with biological, chemical, and physical sensors will be deployed near the enzyme analyzer to help provide a context for the microbial rate measurements (along with additional data from LEO-15).  The enzyme and related data will be analyzed with time-series methods, spectral analysis techniques, statistical modeling, and other techniques to gain insight into microbial processes in the coastal zone. A second deployment of the MEA will take place at the new Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), along with an automated flow cytometer and image analyzer used for plankton cell counting and sorting.  This instrument is under development by Dr. R. Olson and colleagues with Biocomplexity IDEA support. This enzyme analyzer will provide continuous real time microbial metabolic rate measurements on time scales that are currently unavailable. Such measurements will add an important biological component to the extensive chemical and physical measurements that can be made at ocean observatories. In addition, education efforts in aquatic microbiology will include training workshops for primary and secondary school teachers followed by lesson development and implementation, as well as university undergraduate and graduate student research and education"

The underlying motivation for the project is to gain<br/>a better understanding of how spatial effects can threaten or<br/>maintain biodiversity or affect interactions between important<br/>types of organisms such as crops, pests, and biological control<br/>agents.  The project is focused primarily on edge-mediated<br/>effects in habitat fragments and on the effects of nonrandom<br/>dispersal.  The main goal is to gain insight into the ways that<br/>edge-mediated effects and dispersal behavior influence the<br/>persistence or extinction of species.  Understanding edge-mediated<br/>effects is important because one of the most significant ways in<br/>which humans alter natural environments is by fragmenting<br/>habitats and thus creating edges.  The investigators study many<br/>spatial effects, including edge-mediated effects, via<br/>reaction-diffusion models.  However, reaction-diffusion models<br/>assume random dispersal, and the dispersal patterns of some<br/>organisms are affected by behavioral responses to the presence of<br/>prey, predators, or conspecifics.  Reaction-diffusion equations<br/>cannot capture those effects, so the investigators model them<br/>with more general forms of quasilinear parabolic partial<br/>differential equations.  The investigators use methods and<br/>results from the theory of partial differential equations,<br/>dynamical systems, and nonlinear functional analysis to develop<br/>the mathematical framework needed to analyze the models.<br/>     The investigators study mathematical models for the ways<br/>that plant and animal populations are affected by the size and<br/>spatial structure of the environment they inhabit and by the way<br/>they move or spread through the environment.

The underlying motivation is to provide insights<br/>into the impact of spatial effects on biodiversity and on<br/>economically important organisms such as crops and pests.  The<br/>potential practical benefits of the project are improvements in<br/>decision making in areas such as land management, conservation,<br/>and urban planning.  Much of the project is focused on the<br/>effects of habitat edges, because one of the main effects of<br/>human activity on the environment is to divide it into fragments<br/>and create edges, for example by building roads.  Different<br/>organisms respond to edges in different ways; for example, a new<br/>road may isolate a population of one species of animals that<br/>refuse to cross it but may add to the mortality of another<br/>species of animals that do attempt to cross.  When population<br/>interactions such as predation by one species upon another are<br/>combined with spatial effects, the results can be complex and<br/>sometimes counterintuitive.

Livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in Central Asia, and pastures of the Tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population.  Grasslands on the Tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded.  Causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife.  Prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors.  As a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness.  This interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses.  The investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments.  In addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified.  Each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face.  These data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists.  The models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.<br/><br/>This project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status.  Because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental.  Enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide.  In addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of Tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials.  Direct collaboration with Chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers.  Direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.

Obtaining this data is critical if we are to unravel the complex regulatory networks that regulate genome expression.  Although whole genome gene expression can be analyzed by current microarray techniques, this method lacks spacial discrimination and is relatively low resolution in time and magnitude, since by its nature, it measures average gene expression levels over large heterogeneous cell populations.  To understand the regulatory interrelationships between genes, many of which are regulated in highly dynamic and spatially restricted patterns, one must ultimately know how the genome is expressed on a cell-by cell basis throughout development. The most obvious way to obtain fine scale gene expression data at single cell resolution is by performing genome scale in situ hybridization experiments.  <br/><br/>Dr. Bier, Dr. McGinnis, and Dr. Pevzner will address this problem jointly by developing a multiplex in situ hybridization method that will greatly facilitate and enable the acquisition of genome expression data at single cell resolution.  In addition, this collaborative team will validate the method by applying it to two well defined hypothesis driven questions.  The specific goals of this proposal are to:  1)  Develop a multiplex RNA in situ hybridization labeling technique, 2) Analyze Hox gene regulatory networks repressing limb development, and 3)  Identify genes mediating cross-talk between signaling pathways.<br/> <br/>Impact Statement: Because the same genetic systems create pattern during development in diverse metazoans, fine spatial and temporal scale analysis of these regulatory relationships in Drosophila will provide an essential framework for analyzing how these core genetic pathways have served as substrates for modification by natural selection during evolution to tailor body plans to different environments and ecological niches. This knowledge is essential for resolving deep structures of metazoan phylogeny and may reveal whether multicellular metazoans co-opted a polarity generating mechanism present in facultative colonial unicellular organisms to create metameric pattern along the A/P axis.  In addition, the methodologies we develop and the understanding we gain of cellular responses to developmental signals will form the basis for creating detailed  mathematical models of cellular states and will be critical for evaluating how adult organisms respond <br/>"

By far the largest uncertainty about the human domination of the N <br/>cycle on all scales is the amount of reactive N that is converted back to N2 during the last step <br/>of denitrification. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to determine the rate of <br/>accumulation of reactive N in most environmental reservoirs, and thus impossible to assess its <br/>long-term consequences. Nitrogen interacts with carbon and other nutrient cycles and has <br/>numerous cascading effects on water and air quality and climate. An improved understanding <br/>of where, when, and how much reactive N is denitrified could contribute to finding solutions <br/>to the problems created by excessive reactive N in the environment. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, we have little knowledge about rates of denitrification across <br/>landscapes and waterscapes. We know the environmental conditions under which <br/>denitrification occurs, but reliable quantification of N2 production in the field is still relatively <br/>rare. There are three primary reasons for lack of knowledge about N2 production: (1) it is <br/>difficult to measure due to the high atmospheric background concentrations; (2) N2 <br/>production rates are very heterogeneous in space and time; and (3) there is a lack of synergy <br/>between the scientific communities that determine N2 production rates. <br/><br/>We propose holding a 3-day workshop in May 2004 of about 35 participants to focus <br/>on quantification of N2 production via biological denitrification. The objectives of this <br/>workshop will be: (1) to evaluate the state of our knowledge of denitrification rates in a wide <br/>range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; (2) to compare methodologies that have been <br/>adopted by different scientific disciplines, with the expectation that collaborations across <br/>disciplines could yield methodological advances; and (3) to chart out the current weaknesses <br/>and the actions needed to address those weaknesses for an improved global assessment of <br/>where, when, and how much reactive N is converted to N2 in the biosphere. Two important <br/>considerations will be superimposed over a matrix of ecosystem types and methodological <br/>approaches: (1) What are the appropriate scales over which N2 production can and should be <br/>measured?; and (2) How can models be integrated with the measurements to improve <br/>mechanistic understanding of the processes and permit estimation of fluxes at larger spatial <br/>scales, longer temporal scales, and across a range of forecasted scenarios? The results of the <br/>workshop will be published as one or more synthesis papers in a peer-reviewed journal. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this activity include an effort to direct our scientific <br/>understanding of the N cycle toward finding solutions to society.s concerns about <br/>eutrophication of the biosphere. The proposed workshop is being organized as an integral <br/>part of the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), a joint project of SCOPE and IGBP. The <br/>overall goal of the INI is to optimize nitrogen's role in sustainable food and energy <br/>production, while minimizing negative effects on human health and the environment. Hence, <br/>this workshop is part of an effort that has board implications for society by contributing <br/>knowledge to future management the global N cycle to meet objectives of both food security <br/>and environmental quality."

Amy Charkowski, Nicole Perna, and Ching-Hong Yang at the University of Wisconsin and Jeffery Dangl and Sarah Grant at the University of North Carolina to examine the expression, genetic diversity and evolution of the suites of virulence genes present in different strains of an important plant pathogenic bacterium. This bacterium, Erwinia carotovora, causes devastating ""wilt"" or ""soft rot"" diseases of important crops, including potato and its wild relatives. The wild host plants come from diverse environments around the world, particularly in the Andes region of South America, which is the ancestral home of potato. <br/><br/>This project will foster collaborations among a multidisciplinary group of scientists from five institutions in three countries. It will result in the training of student and postdoctoral researchers in each laboratory. It will also increase the capabilities of the laboratory facilities at one of the largest field research stations in Wisconsin, thus allowing modern molecular biology experiments to be performed on field samples near the research sites.<br/><br/>Even though E. carotovora is strictly a plant pathogen, it shares many virulence genes with important animal pathogens that cause diseases ranging from gastrointestinal illness to the plague. The results from this work will therefore provide information applicable to many diseases. This project will focus on a crucial common virulence system. This virulence system uses a ""molecular syringe"" to deliver bacterial proteins called effectors directly into animal or plant host cells. Once inside, the effector proteins manipulate the host cells to suppress disease defenses and promote bacterial growth. Nearly all studies of this key protein delivery system have been limited to laboratory settings. This project will bring studies from the laboratory to the field in order to understand the effects of the natural environment on the expression and function of these crucial virulence genes in a variety of plant hosts. <br/> <br/>Genes encoding effector proteins vary tremendously, even within the same species. Thus the first goal of this project will be to identify as many of the E. carotovora effector proteins as possible using a new high throughput system. The investigators will then determine which of these effectors are produced in bacteria found on diseased plants in a variety of natural locations that differ in their ecology. Preliminary results indicate that field plants are typically infected with multiple strains of E. carotovora. In contrast, laboratory studies typically involve infecting a each plant with only one strain. By identifying the effectors present in each individual strain from naturally-infected plants, it will be possible to determine whether the effectors work in combination to promote growth of multiple strains. <br/><br/>To quantify the contribution that the effector genes make to bacterial growth and survival in the natural environment, E. carotovora mutants will be examined on diverse plants under natural conditions. Finally, wild plant species will be examined to determine if they have disease resistance genes that recognize specific E. carotovora effector proteins, and protect the plants from disease. The combined results from these experiments will be among the first tests of the presence, expression, effects and diversity of bacterial virulence genes under natural conditions. The gene sequence and expression data from these experiments will be deposited in ASAP (https://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/annotation/php/ASAP1.htm), a publicly-available searchable web-based database."

This project takes an aggressive approach to increase our understanding of the biology of this organism by determining the complete genome sequence, and identifying the unique features of Epulopiscium that have allowed these exceptional bacteria to attain cellular sizes that are orders of magnitude larger than most bacteria. These analyses will identify genomic and cellular modifications that may have been employed in the progenitor of all eukaryotes as a first step toward the development of the contemporary eukaryotic cell. Comparative analyses with the complete genome sequences of endospore-forming bacteria will identify sporulation gene homologues in the Epulopiscium genome that can serve as targets of future analyses to determine the role of these genes in intracellular offspring production. Finally, this project will generate a physiological profile of Epulopiscium sp. based on the complete genome sequence. This component will address how the normal environment of this species (the guts of surgeonfish) may have enabled the evolution of these life-style novelties, and serve as a framework for developing culture media to grow Epulopiscium in the laboratory so that more detailed experiments on this species can be conducted. <br/><br/>Collaborations, discussions, and data exchange with both domestic and international groups that are studying Epulopiscium biology, spore-forming bacteria, and extremely large bacteria will be encouraged.

Livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in Central Asia, and pastures of the Tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population. Grasslands on the Tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded. Causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife. Prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors. As a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness. This interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses. The investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments. In addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified. Each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face. These data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists. The models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.<br/><br/>This project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status. Because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental. Enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide. In addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of Tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials. Direct collaboration with Chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers. Direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.

The project is motivated by the fact that particulate black carbon (BC), which is treated equivalent to EC in the measurements, is a strong absorber of solar radiation, and thought to account for ~15-30% of global warming estimates, next only to greenhouse gases; however, the magnitude of this forcing on climate is highly uncertain. Aerosol BC has a residence time of about a week so it can travel thousands of kilometers before removal; thus its concentrations are dependent on the distance from emission sources. Reliable estimation of the radiative impacts in the U.S. from nearby and remote sources of BC depends critically on obtaining regionally representative measurements. <br/><br/>The PIs will determine the {EC} in filters collected every 6 h during summer and every 48 h during the winter of 1998 and 2002 at Whiteface Mt, and every 24 h at Mayville for the same years.

Prior studies have shown EC and SO4 measurements from these two sites to be regionally representative and highly correlated with known import of upwind airmasses.

The ultimate purpose is to simulate their radiative feedbacks to the atmospheric dynamics. Nested continental- to-regional- to-local-scale simulations over the observational sites will allow the PIs to examine the effects of long-range transport and grid refinement on the model predictions. The model sensitivity to emissions growth and control, and to successive improvements in the representation of sources such as wild fires and wind-blown dust will be examined using three different emission inventories in the input data. <br/><br/>The project will build upon, and augment current NSF-funded measurement and modeling projects being performed by both PIs.

The objective of this project is to develop a suite of five sensors designed for in situ analysis of the ecosystem in and around hydrothermal deep-sea vents. This ecosystem may be one of the most ancient of Earth and have had a long-term effect on global geochemical cycles, yet it is one of the least well understood. Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are in a turbulent state of disequilibrium with large gradients of thermal and chemical energy. Along this thermal/chemical gradient a complex ecosystem of tube worms, thermophilic microbes, and specially adapted crustaceans and fish survive The sensors are chosen that best monitor the physical, chemical, and biological environment of the vent ecosystem to better understand the inter-relationship between this unique environment and the life that it supports. The development of in situ chemical sensors will provide a significant advancement in the state of the art of hydrothermal vent monitoring. <br/><br/>We will employ a fiber optic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensor integrated with a thermocouple and conductivity sensor to better measure the density hydrothermal vent fluid and salinity of the seawater surrounding the vent. Fiber optic SPR sensors can be made sufficiently small and sensitive to probe the vent fluid/sea water gradient where many thermophilic microbes reside. A fiber optic coupled grating light reflectance spectroscopy (GLRS) sensor will be employed to monitor the size distribution and relative abundance of mineral precipitates that form during the mixing of vent fluid and sea water. This precipitate forms the vent chimney walls where most microbes reside. Fiber optic Raman spectroscopy probes will be tested to detect trace organic molecules that may be forming biotically or abiotically in the vent fluid. Raman spectroscopy will also be tested to survey the mineral and microbial distribution on the vent walls. An ambient pressure driven liquid chromatography-Raman spectroscopy system will be developed to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to simple organic molecules that may serve as food for or originate as waste from microbes in the vent ecosystem. Sensitivity enhancement will come from novel waveguide technology that has been demonstrated to push Raman detection limits to low ppb for simple alcohols. Finally, a fiber optic, single measurement excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorometer will be adapted to detect and characterize larger biomolecules such as amino acids, proteins, and DNA fragments that may prove indicative of biological activity in the vent ecosystem Each of the proposed sensors has been previously developed past the proof of concept stage for environmental or industrial process monitoring. The project will adapt and test the sensors for the more challenging application of deep sea vent monitoring. The sensors represent a promising technology that fills a large need in the oceanographic/ life in extreme environments community. If the proposed NEPTUNE network of deep-sea research nodes were built, these sensors would be ideal for long-term field deployment. Successful development of these sensors would lead to expansion of the technology for other biological and environmental process monitoring applications."

Despite the acclaim accorded interdisciplinary research, relatively little scholarly attention has been given to dynamics that result in effective work that spans disciplinary boundaries. This project will use a multi-level, multi-method approach to study interdisciplinary collaboration as it relates to scientific production and innovation. The investigators will combine a socio-anthropological approach with an organizational perspective to examine how interdisciplinary collaboration transpires as well as when and how it leads to scientific production and innovation. This project will be a pilot study designed to test the effectiveness and tractability of a range of approaches on a sample of interdisciplinary centers that focus on environmental research and education and that have received NSF research support. The pilot will emphasize two strands if research. The first strand will focus on interdisciplinary research network structure. It will use techniques of social network analysis to explore structural relations among individuals in eight sample centers. Data used in this part of the pilot will be drawn from a variety of sources, including surveys of individual researchers, a census of ties among individuals within centers, and bibliometric analyses of citations in curriculum vitae. The second strand will focus on interdisciplinary research network dynamics. This strand will focus on interaction and organizational analyses of knowledge transfer, conversion, and integration. Special attention will be given to the connectedness, centrality, and roles and positions of different researchers and disciplines in the networks of two sample centers. Data will be gathered through the conduct of interviews, the review of artifacts and documents, and the observation of activities in the centers. The results of these activities will be used to generate white papers, to make presentations as major meetings of groups like the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Sociological Association, and to submit papers to scholarly journals like Social Studies of Science, Science Communication, Human Communication Research, Social Epistemology, and Organization Science.<br/><br/>Through these analyses, the investigators expect to provide new insights into the personal, organizational, psychological, and intellectual components of the research environments and interactions within centers, and they expect to distinguish between factors that characterize successful interdisciplinary collaborations. This project will advance general knowledge of the factors that lead to successful interdisciplinary research, thereby facilitating such work among members of the myriad research communities who now are exploring collaborative work with each other. The project also should assist NSF and other funding agencies in assessing which proposed projects are most likely to generate new insights that span traditional disciplinary boundaries. This project is being supported with funds designated by NSF for the support of projects in Biocomplexity in the Environment."
