American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The effect of environmental policy on water resources is often challenging to evaluate due to dynamic interactions between people and water, particularly in data-scarce watersheds. Increasing interactions between society and hydrology present a need to understand causal relations for improved assessment and prediction in complex human-water systems. Conventional approaches to causal assessment in hydrology are sometimes insufficient due to data scarcity or system complexity. We argue that natural experiments present a promising and complementary avenue for assessing causal relations in such systems. In this spirit, we describe a natural experiment to assess causal effects of the Ganges water treaty, between India and Bangladesh, on streamflow and channel salinity in the Ganges delta in Bangladesh. We apply causal inference to assess the effect of the treaty on streamflow and use the results to generate synthetic ensembles of streamflow and salinity under a realistic scenario (with the treaty) and a counterfactual scenario (without the treaty). We then use synthetic streamflow ensembles to model salinity ensembles. The Ganges water treaty increased dry-season streamflow in Bangladesh by approximately 18% and decreased channel salinity by approximately 10%. The treaty has the greatest effect on salinity in Bangladesh in the driest years, but the overall effect is small compared with natural variability. We show that our approach accounts for natural hydrologic variability to accurately assess the causal effect of the treaty, compared with a naive approach that greatly overestimates the effect. This research demonstrates the value of natural experiments for causal assessment in coupled human-water systems.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021158', 'afid': '60021158', 'affilname': 'Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Dhaka', 'affiliation-country': 'Bangladesh'}]",Journal,Article,"['Penny G.', 'Mondal M.S.', 'Biswas S.', 'Bolster D.', 'Tank J.L.', 'Müller M.F.']","['55935648500', '8982591600', '57199007378', '57205870864', '7004885835', '57189929871']",Bangladesh | causal inference | delta | difference in difference | India | transboundary treaty,NSF,ICER 1824951,National Science Foundation,,1824951

All rights reserved. A growing empirical literature associates climate anomalies with increased risk of violent conflict. This association has been portrayed as a bellwether of future societal instability as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are predicted to increase. This paper investigates the theoretical foundation of this claim. A seminal microeconomic model of opportunity costs-a mechanism often thought to drive climate-conflict relationships- is extended by considering realistic changes in the distribution of climate-dependent agricultural income. Results advise caution in using empirical associations between short-run climate anomalies and conflicts to predict the effect of sustained shifts in climate regimes: Although war occurs in bad years, conflict may decrease if agents expect more frequent bad years. Theory suggests a nonmonotonic relation between climate variability and conflict that emerges as agents adapt and adjust their behavior to the new income distribution. We identify 3 measurable statistics of the income distribution that are each unambiguously associated with conflict likelihood. Jointly, these statistics offer a unique signature to distinguish opportunity costs from competing mechanisms that may relate climate anomalies to conflict.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013649', 'afid': '60013649', 'affilname': 'California State University, Sacramento', 'affiliation-city': 'Sacramento', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Roche K.R.', 'Müller-Itten M.', 'Dralle D.N.', 'Bolster D.', 'Müller M.F.']","['56995760600', '57194709208', '35181040100', '57205870864', '57189929871']",Agriculture | Income shock | Microeconomic theory | Rainfall | Violence,NSF,1824951,National Science Foundation,,1824951

Salinization of freshwater and soils is a global phenomenon that adversely affects 500 million people, particularly in low-lying river deltas. Impacts of salinity on food and water security and agricultural livelihoods are well documented and reviewed herein, along with additional effects on human health that have received less attention and warrant further study. Populations forced to consume saline waters display increased occurrence of diseases such as hypertension in Bangladesh, particularly among the rural poor in coastal areas. This review synthesizes knowledge on socio-hydrological drivers of salinization in large river deltas globally. Multiple drivers arise at different scales and include agricultural practices, upstream water diversion, and relative sea level rise and can be amplified through feedback from inappropriate adaptation strategies.

Because human and environmental systems in the Anthropocene are increasingly coupled, hydrologists and economists often find themselves studying the same systems from different vantage points. Here we argue that synthesis across economics and hydrology can help address two pressing sociohydrologic challenges: actionable prediction and the generation of transferable knowledge from place-based studies. Specifically, we review (1) empirical methods and (2) theoretical approaches from economics and connect the two through a proposed iterative framework. First, we find that empirical methods for statistical analysis of natural and quasi-experiments in economics can be leveraged to distinguish causal relations from mere correlations in complex and data scarce systems, which can help address the challenge of sociohydrologic prediction. Second, we find that economic theories based on rational choice can be used to decipher known paradoxes in water resources, which can help address the challenge of sociohydrologic knowledge generation. In both empirical and theoretical domains, specialized knowledge in hydrology remains critical to properly applying techniques from economics to coupled human-water systems.

Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Schistosomiasis - a parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people across the globe - is primarily transmitted between human definitive hosts and snail intermediate hosts. To reduce schistosomiasis transmission, some have advocated disrupting the schistosome life cycle through biological control of snails, achieved by boosting the abundance of snails' natural predators. But little is known about the effect of parasitic infection on predator-prey interactions, especially in the case of schistosomiasis. Here, we present the results of laboratory experiments performed on Bulinus truncatus and Biomphalaria glabrata snails to investigate: (i) rates of predation on schistosome-infected versus uninfected snails by a sympatric native river prawn, Macrobrachium vollenhovenii, and (ii) differences in snail behavior (including movement, refuge-seeking and anti-predator behavior) between infected and uninfected snails. In predation trials, prawns showed a preference for consuming snails infected with schistosome larvae. In behavioral trials, infected snails moved less quickly and less often than uninfected snails, and were less likely to avoid predation by exiting the water or hiding under substrate. Although the mechanism by which the parasite alters snail behavior remains unknown, these results provide insight into the effects of parasitic infection on predator-prey dynamics and suggest that boosting natural rates of predation on snails may be a useful strategy for reducing transmission in schistosomiasis hotspots.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Swartz S.', 'De Leo G.', 'Wood C.', 'Sokolow S.']","['57188825064', '7006105591', '17347288000', '8725138200']",Behavior manipulation | Biological control | Parasitism | Schistosoma,,undefined,,,1414102

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, where it represents a major health problem. We study the drivers of its geographical distribution in Senegal via a spatially explicit network model accounting for epidemiological dynamics driven by local socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and human mobility. The model is parameterized by tapping several available geodatabases and a large dataset of mobile phone traces. It reliably reproduces the observed spatial patterns of regional schistosomiasis prevalence throughout the country, provided that spatial heterogeneity and human mobility are suitably accounted for. Specifically, a fine-grained description of the socioeconomic and environmental heterogeneities involved in local disease transmission is crucial to capturing the spatial variability of disease prevalence, while the inclusion of human mobility significantly improves the explanatory power of the model. Concerning human movement, we find that moderate mobility may reduce disease prevalence, whereas either high or low mobility may result in increased prevalence of infection. The effects of control strategies based on exposure and contamination reduction via improved access to safe water or educational campaigns are also analyzed.

Dams have long been associated with elevated burdens of human schistosomiasis, but how dams increase disease is not always clear, in part because dams have many ecological and socio-economic effects. A recent hypothesis argues that dams block reproduction of the migratory river prawns that eat the snail hosts of schistosomiasis. In the Senegal River Basin, there is evidence that prawn populations declined and schistosomiasis increased after completion of the Diama Dam. Restoring prawns to a water-access site upstream of the dam reduced snail density and reinfection rates in people. However, whether a similar cascade of effects (from dams to prawns to snails to human schistosomiasis) occurs elsewhere is unknown. Here, we examine large dams worldwide and identify where their catchments intersect with endemic schistosomiasis and the historical habitat ranges of large, migratory Macrobrachium spp. prawns. River prawn habitats are widespread, and we estimate that 277–385 million people live within schistosomiasis-endemic regions where river prawns are or were present (out of the 800 million people who are at risk of schistosomiasis). Using a published repository of schistosomiasis studies in sub-Saharan Africa, we compared infection before and after the construction of 14 large dams for people living in: (i) upstream catchments within historical habitats of native prawns, (ii) comparable undammed watersheds, and (iii) dammed catchments beyond the historical reach of migratory prawns. Damming was followed by greater increases in schistosomiasis within prawn habitats than outside prawn habitats. We estimate that one third to one half of the global population-at-risk of schistosomiasis could benefit from restoration of native prawns. Because dams block prawn migrations, our results suggest that prawn extirpation contributes to the sharp increase of schistosomiasis after damming, and points to prawn restoration as an ecological solution for reducing human disease.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60159529', 'afid': '60159529', 'affilname': 'Medaille College', 'affiliation-city': 'Buffalo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sokolow S.H.', 'Jones I.J.', 'Jocque M.', 'La D.', 'Cords O.', 'Knight A.', 'Lund A.', 'Wood C.L.', 'Lafferty K.D.', 'Hoover C.M.', 'Collender P.A.', 'Remais J.V.', 'Lopez-Carr D.', 'Fisk J.', 'Kuris A.M.', 'de Leo G.A.']","['8725138200', '57190491261', '6504029293', '57194091504', '57194088689', '57194091411', '57194096248', '17347288000', '7102712700', '57189504361', '56938851400', '6504709208', '55510801600', '57196792800', '7003855055', '7006105591']",Bilharzia | Biological control | Dam | Disease control | Planetary health | Schistosome,NIH,R01AI125842,National Institutes of Health,,1414102

All Rights Reserved. Background: Despite control efforts, human schistosomiasis remains prevalent throughout Africa, Asia, and South America. The global schistosomiasis burden has changed little since the new anthelmintic drug, praziquantel, promised widespread control. Methodology: We evaluated large-scale schistosomiasis control attempts over the past century and across the globe by identifying factors that predict control program success: snail control (e.g., molluscicides or biological control), mass drug administrations (MDA) with praziquantel, or a combined strategy using both. For data, we compiled historical information on control tactics and their quantitative outcomes for all 83 countries and territories in which: (i) schistosomiasis was allegedly endemic during the 20th century, and (ii) schistosomiasis remains endemic, or (iii) schistosomiasis has been ""eliminated,"" or is ""no longer endemic,"" or transmission has been interrupted. Principal Findings: Widespread snail control reduced prevalence by 92 ± 5% (N = 19) vs. 37 ± 7% (N = 29) for programs using little or no snail control. In addition, ecological, economic, and political factors contributed to schistosomiasis elimination. For instance, snail control was most common and widespread in wealthier countries and when control began earlier in the 20th century. Conclusions/Significance: Snail control has been the most effective way to reduce schistosomiasis prevalence. Despite evidence that snail control leads to long-term disease reduction and elimination, most current schistosomiasis control efforts emphasize MDA using praziquantel over snail control. Combining drug-based control programs with affordable snail control seems the best strategy for eliminating schistosomiasis.",64,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013804', 'afid': '60013804', 'affilname': 'Biomedical Research Institute, Rockville', 'affiliation-city': 'Rockville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005723', 'afid': '60005723', 'affilname': 'Childrens National Health System', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003088', 'afid': '60003088', 'affilname': 'The George Washington University', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sokolow S.', 'Wood C.', 'Jones I.', 'Swartz S.', 'Lopez M.', 'Hsieh M.', 'Lafferty K.', 'Kuris A.', 'Rickards C.', 'De Leo G.']","['8725138200', '17347288000', '57190491261', '57188825064', '57190496703', '8956430300', '7102712700', '7003855055', '57190493104', '7006105591']",,,undefined,,,1414102

Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne parasitic disease that ranks among the most important water-based diseases of humans in developing countries. Increased prevalence and spread of human schistosomiasis to non-endemic areas has been consistently linked with water resource management related to agricultural expansion. However, the role of agrochemical pollution in human schistosome transmission remains unexplored, despite strong evidence of agrochemicals increasing snail-borne diseases of wildlife and a projected 2- to 5-fold increase in global agrochemical use by 2050. Using a field mesocosm experiment, we show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fertilizer, a herbicide, and an insecticide, individually and as mixtures, increase densities of schistosome-infected snails by increasing the algae snails eat and decreasing densities of snail predators. Epidemiological models indicate that these agrochemical effects can increase transmission of schistosomes. Identifying agricultural practices or agrochemicals that minimize disease risk will be critical to meeting growing food demands while improving human wellbeing.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107959', 'afid': '60107959', 'affilname': 'IBM Australia Ltd', 'affiliation-city': 'Sydney', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019578', 'afid': '60019578', 'affilname': 'Monash University', 'affiliation-city': 'Melbourne', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011873', 'afid': '60011873', 'affilname': 'Oakland University', 'affiliation-city': 'Rochester', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011362', 'afid': '60011362', 'affilname': 'RMIT University', 'affiliation-city': 'Melbourne', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003527', 'afid': '60003527', 'affilname': 'The University of Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000928', 'afid': '60000928', 'affilname': 'Emory University', 'affiliation-city': 'Atlanta', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000445', 'afid': '60000445', 'affilname': 'Institut Pasteur Lille', 'affiliation-city': 'Lille', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120331306', 'afid': '120331306', 'affilname': 'Wildlands Conservation', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112879598', 'afid': '112879598', 'affilname': 'Centre de Recherche Biomédicale Espoir Pour La Santé (CRB-EPLS)', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint-Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}]",Journal,Article,"['Halstead N.T.', 'Hoover C.M.', 'Arakala A.', 'Civitello D.J.', 'De Leo G.A.', 'Gambhir M.', 'Johnson S.A.', 'Jouanard N.', 'Loerns K.A.', 'McMahon T.A.', 'Ndione R.A.', 'Nguyen K.', 'Raffel T.R.', 'Remais J.V.', 'Riveau G.', 'Sokolow S.H.', 'Rohr J.R.']","['25632236500', '57189504361', '23388495000', '23982049000', '7006105591', '35279721500', '34769751400', '55758262900', '57201065093', '45561539000', '57201055460', '57201053913', '14424444700', '6504709208', '7004681431', '8725138200', '57203469189']",,EPA,83518801,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,,1414102

However, for some diseases like schistosomiasis, a widespread parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma worms, accounting for heterogeneity is crucial to both characterize long-term dynamics and evaluate opportunities for disease control. Elaborating on the classic Macdonald model for macroparasite transmission, we analyze families of models including explicit descriptions of heterogeneity related to differential transmission risk within a community, water contact patterns, the distribution of the snail host population, human mobility, and the seasonal fluctuations of the environment. Through simple numerical examples, we show that heterogeneous multigroup communities may be more prone to schistosomiasis than homogeneous ones, that the availability of multiple water sources can hinder parasite transmission, and that both spatial and temporal heterogeneities may have nontrivial implications for disease endemicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of heterogeneity for disease control. Although focused on schistosomiasis, results from this study may apply as well to other parasitic infections with complex transmission cycles, such as cysticercosis, dracunculiasis and fasciolosis.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028186', 'afid': '60028186', 'affilname': 'Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'affiliation-city': 'Lausanne', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023256', 'afid': '60023256', 'affilname': 'Politecnico di Milano', 'affiliation-city': 'Milan', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013494', 'afid': '60013494', 'affilname': ""Università Ca' Foscari Venezia"", 'affiliation-city': 'Venice', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000481', 'afid': '60000481', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Padova', 'affiliation-city': 'Padua', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mari L.', 'Ciddio M.', 'Casagrandi R.', 'Perez-Saez J.', 'Bertuzzo E.', 'Rinaldo A.', 'Sokolow S.H.', 'De Leo G.A.', 'Gatto M.']","['16426017600', '56524598400', '6602656510', '57142399100', '23972622800', '7103192491', '8725138200', '7006105591', '7006490979']",Disease control | Heterogeneous transmission | Macroparasitic model | Schistosomiasis,,1R01TW010286-01,Politecnico di Milano,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022519317303818,1414102

All rights reserved. Pathogen spillover between different host species is the trigger for many infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events, and ecosystem boundary areas have been suggested as spatial hotspots of spillover. This hypothesis is largely based on suspected higher rates of zoonotic disease spillover and emergence in fragmented landscapes and other areas where humans live in close vicinity to wildlife. For example, Ebola virus outbreaks have been linked to contacts between humans and infected wildlife at the rural-forest border, and spillover of yellow fever via mosquito vectors happens at the interface between forest and human settlements. Because spillover involves complex interactions between multiple species and is difficult to observe directly, empirical studies are scarce, particularly those that quantify underlying mechanisms. In this review, we identify and explore potential ecological mechanisms affecting spillover of pathogens (and parasites in general) at ecosystem boundaries. We borrow the concept of 'permeability' from animal movement ecology as a measure of the likelihood that hosts and parasites are present in an ecosystem boundary region. We then discuss how different mechanisms operating at the levels of organisms and ecosystems might affect permeability and spillover.

Progress towards controlling and eliminating parasitic worms, including schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis, is advancing rapidly as national governments, multinational NGOs, and pharmaceutical companies launch collaborative chemotherapeutic control campaigns. Critical questions remain regarding the potential for achieving elimination of these infections, and analytical methods can help to quickly estimate progress towards—and the probability of achieving—elimination over specific timeframes. Here, we propose the effective reproduction number, R eff , as a proxy of elimination potential for sexually reproducing worms that are subject to poor mating success at very low abundance (positive density dependence, or Allee effects). R eff is the number of parasites produced by a single reproductive parasite at a given stage in the transmission cycle, over the parasite’s lifetime—it is the generalized form of the more familiar basic reproduction number, R 0 , which only applies at the beginning of an epidemic—and it can be estimated in a ‘model-free’ manner by an estimator (‘ε’). We introduce ε, demonstrate its estimation using simulated data, and discuss how it may be used in planning and evaluation of ongoing elimination efforts for a range of parasitic diseases.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107959', 'afid': '60107959', 'affilname': 'IBM Australia Ltd', 'affiliation-city': 'Sydney', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019578', 'afid': '60019578', 'affilname': 'Monash University', 'affiliation-city': 'Melbourne', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Arakala A.', 'Hoover C.', 'Marshall J.', 'Sokolow S.', 'De Leo G.', 'Rohr J.', 'Remais J.', 'Gambhir M.']","['23388495000', '57189504361', '55471919700', '8725138200', '7006105591', '57203469189', '6504709208', '35279721500']",,NSF,1360330,National Science Foundation,,1414102

More than 200 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with schistosome parasites. Transmission of schistosomiasis occurs when people come into contact with larval schistosomes emitted from freshwater snails in the aquatic environment. Thus, controlling snails through augmenting or restoring their natural enemies, such as native predators and competitors, could offer sustainable control for this human disease. Fishes may reduce schistosomiasis transmission directly, by preying on snails or parasites, or indirectly, by competing with snails for food or by reducing availability of macrophyte habitat (i.e., aquatic plants) where snails feed and reproduce. To identify fishes that might serve as native biological control agents for schistosomiasis in the lower Senegal River basin—one of the highest transmission areas for human schistosomiasis globally—we surveyed the freshwater fish that inhabit shallow, nearshore habitats and conducted multivariate analyses with quantitative diet data for each of the fish species encountered. Ten of the 16 fish species we encountered exhibited diets that may result in direct (predation) and/or indirect (food competition and habitat removal) control of snails. Fish abundance was low, suggesting limited effects on schistosomiasis transmission by the contemporary fish community in the lower Senegal River basin in the wild. Here, we highlight some native species—such as tilapia, West African lungfish, and freshwater prawns—that could be aquacultured for local-scale biological control of schistosomiasis transmission.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122026304', 'afid': '122026304', 'affilname': 'Biomedical Research Center Espoir Pour La Santé', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint-Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118695934', 'afid': '118695934', 'affilname': 'Santé Plus', 'affiliation-city': 'Dakar', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}]",Journal,Article,"['Arostegui M.', 'Wood C.', 'Jones I.', 'Chamberlin A.', 'Jouanard N.', 'Faye D.', 'Kuris A.', 'Riveau G.', 'De Leo G.', 'Sokolow S.']","['57191504233', '17347288000', '57190491261', '57205371637', '55758262900', '23481728000', '7003855055', '7004681431', '7006105591', '8725138200']",,NSF,DGE – 1656518,National Science Foundation,,1414102

Recent evidence suggests that snail predators may aid efforts to control the human parasitic disease schistosomiasis by eating aquatic snail species that serve as intermediate hosts of the parasite. Here, potential synergies between schistosomiasis control and aquaculture of giant prawns are evaluated using an integrated bioeconomic–epidemiological model. Combinations of stocking density and aquaculture cycle length that maximize cumulative, discounted profit are identified for two prawn species in sub-Saharan Africa: the endemic, non-domesticated Macrobrachium vollenhovenii and the non-native, domesticated Macrobrachium rosenbergii. At profit-maximizing densities, both M. rosenbergii and M. vollenhovenii may substantially reduce intermediate host snail populations and aid schistosomiasis control efforts. Control strategies drawing on both prawn aquaculture to reduce intermediate host snail populations and mass drug administration to treat infected individuals are found to be superior to either strategy alone. Integrated aquaculture-based interventions can be a win–win strategy in terms of health and sustainable development in schistosomiasis endemic regions of the world.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028186', 'afid': '60028186', 'affilname': 'Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'affiliation-city': 'Lausanne', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161', 'afid': '60027161', 'affilname': 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev', 'affiliation-city': 'Beer Sheba', 'affiliation-country': 'Israel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023256', 'afid': '60023256', 'affilname': 'Politecnico di Milano', 'affiliation-city': 'Milan', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010137', 'afid': '60010137', 'affilname': 'Kentucky State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Frankfort', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006191', 'afid': '60006191', 'affilname': 'Google LLC', 'affiliation-city': 'Mountain View', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115440738', 'afid': '115440738', 'affilname': 'Middlebury Institute of International Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113166860', 'afid': '113166860', 'affilname': 'EPLS Biomedical Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint-Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hoover C.', 'Sokolow S.', 'Kemp J.', 'Sanchirico J.', 'Lund A.', 'Jones I.', 'Higginson T.', 'Riveau G.', 'Savaya A.', 'Coyle S.', 'Wood C.', 'Micheli F.', 'Casagrandi R.', 'Mari L.', 'Gatto M.', 'Rinaldo A.', 'Perez-Saez J.', 'Rohr J.', 'Sagi A.', 'Remais J.', 'De Leo G.']","['57189504361', '8725138200', '57209805719', '6603128224', '57194096248', '57190491261', '57209807924', '7004681431', '57209804393', '7005684750', '17347288000', '7101777512', '6602656510', '16426017600', '7006490979', '7103192491', '57142399100', '57203469189', '7006933187', '6504709208', '7006105591']",,UC,MRP-17-446315,University of California,,1414102

Feeding 11 billion people will require substantial increases in crop and animal production that will expand agricultural use of antibiotics, water, pesticides and fertilizer, and contact rates between humans and both wild and domestic animals, all with consequences for the emergence and spread of infectious agents. Indeed, our synthesis of the literature suggests that, since 1940, agricultural drivers were associated with >25% of all — and >50% of zoonotic — infectious diseases that emerged in humans, proportions that will likely increase as agriculture expands and intensifies.

Humanschistosomiasis is a snail-borne parasitic disease affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Direct contact with snail-infested freshwater is the primary route of exposure. Water management infrastructure, including dams and irrigation schemes, expands snail habitat, increasing the risk across the landscape. The Diama Dam, built on the lower basin of the Senegal River to prevent saltwater intrusion and promote year-round agriculture in the drought-prone Sahel, is a paradigmatic case. Since dam completion in 1986, the rural population-whose livelihoods rely mostly on agriculture-has suffered high rates of schistosome infection. The region remains one of the most hyperendemic regions in the world. Because of the convergence between livelihoods and environmental conditions favorable to transmission, schistosomiasis is considered an illustrative case of a disease-driven poverty trap (DDPT). The literature to date on the topic, however, remains largely theoretical. With qualitative data generated from 12 focus groups in four villages, we conducted team-based theme analysis to investigate how perception of schistosomiasis risk and reported preventive behaviors may suggest the presence of a DDPT. Our analysis reveals three key findings: 1) rural villagers understand schistosomiasis risk (i.e., where and when infections occur), 2) accordingly, they adopt some preventive behaviors, but ultimately, 3) exposure persists, because of circumstances characteristic of rural livelihoods. These findings highlight the capacity of local populations to participate actively in schistosomiasis control programs and the limitations of widespread drug treatment campaigns. Interventions that target the environmental reservoir of disease may provide opportunities to reduce exposure while maintaining resource-dependent livelihoods.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032838', 'afid': '60032838', 'affilname': 'Stanford University School of Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'Stanford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123262042', 'afid': '123262042', 'affilname': ""Station d'Innovation Aquacole"", 'affiliation-city': 'Saint Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113550478', 'afid': '113550478', 'affilname': 'Centre de Recherche Biomédicale (CRB)', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint-Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lund A.', 'Sam M.', 'Sy A.', 'Sow O.', 'Ali S.', 'Sokolow S.', 'Merrell S.', 'Bruce J.', 'Jouanard N.', 'Senghor S.', 'Riveau G.', 'Lopez-Carr D.', 'De Leo G.']","['57194096248', '57211202593', '57211200735', '57211199505', '57193508949', '8725138200', '57210856884', '55177942700', '55758262900', '55251884800', '7004681431', '55510801600', '7006105591']",,NSF,R01TW010286,National Science Foundation,,1414102

All rights reserved. Spillover of a pathogen from awildlife reservoir into a human or livestock host requires the pathogen to overcome a hierarchical series of barriers. Interventions aimed at one or more of these barriers may be able to prevent the occurrence of spillover. Here, we demonstrate how interventions that target the ecological context in which spillover occurs (i.e. ecological interventions) can complement conventional approaches like vaccination, treatment, disinfection and chemical control. Accelerating spillover owing to environmental change requires effective, affordable, durable and scalable solutions that fully harness the complex processes involved in cross-species pathogen spillover.

All rights reserved. Recently, the World Health Organization recognized that efforts to interrupt schistosomiasis transmission through mass drug administration have been ineffective in some regions; one of their new recommended strategies for global schistosomiasis control emphasizes targeting the freshwater snails that transmit schistosome parasites. We sought to identify robust indicators that would enable precision targeting of these snails. At the site of the world's largest recorded schistosomiasis epidemic-the Lower Senegal River Basin in Senegal-intensive sampling revealed positive relationships between intermediate host snails (abundance, density, and prevalence) and human urogenital schistosomiasis reinfection (prevalence and intensity in schoolchildren after drug administration). However, we also found that snail distributions were so patchy in space and time that obtaining useful data required effort that exceeds what is feasible in standard monitoring and control campaigns. Instead, we identified several environmental proxies that were more effective than snail variables for predicting human infection: the area covered by suitable snail habitat (i.e., floating, nonemergent vegetation), the percent cover by suitable snail habitat, and size of the water contact area. Unlike snail surveys, which require hundreds of person-hours per site to conduct, habitat coverage and site area can be quickly estimated with drone or satellite imagery. This, in turn, makes possible large-scale, high-resolution estimation of human urogenital schistosomiasis risk to support targeting of both mass drug administration and snail control efforts.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068588', 'afid': '60068588', 'affilname': 'Koninklijk Belgisch Instituut voor Natuurwetenschappen', 'affiliation-city': 'Brussels', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029194', 'afid': '60029194', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina Wilmington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wilmington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027550', 'afid': '60027550', 'affilname': 'University of California, Los Angeles', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Angeles', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026530', 'afid': '60026530', 'affilname': 'Royal Veterinary College University of London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025352', 'afid': '60025352', 'affilname': 'The Natural History Museum, London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150', 'afid': '60015150', 'affilname': 'Imperial College London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123262042', 'afid': '123262042', 'affilname': ""Station d'Innovation Aquacole"", 'affiliation-city': 'Saint Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122026304', 'afid': '122026304', 'affilname': 'Biomedical Research Center Espoir Pour La Santé', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint-Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'Senegal'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wood C.', 'Sokolow S.', 'Jones I.', 'Chamberlin A.', 'Lafferty K.', 'Kuris A.', 'Jocque M.', 'Hopkins S.', 'Adams G.', 'Buck J.', 'Lund A.', 'Garcia-Vedrenne A.', 'Fiorenza E.', 'Rohr J.', 'Allan F.', 'Webster B.', 'Rabone M.', 'Webster J.', 'Bandagny L.', 'Ndione R.', 'Senghor S.', 'Schacht A.', 'Jouanard N.', 'Riveau G.', 'De Leo G.']","['17347288000', '8725138200', '57190491261', '57205371637', '7102712700', '7003855055', '6504029293', '55927184400', '56463457900', '22833405300', '57194096248', '55886039300', '57193343779', '57203469189', '40260888700', '10838967000', '55347757500', '23040249800', '57201032285', '57201055460', '55251884800', '6701326959', '55758262900', '7004681431', '7006105591']",Bilharzia | Ecological levers for infectious disease control | Snail control | Spatial ecology | Urogenital schistosomiasis,WT,OPP1114050,Wellcome Trust,,1414102

In areas where human schistosomiasis is endemic, infection prevalence and egg output are known to rise rapidly through childhood, reach a peak at 8–15 years of age, and decline thereafter. A similar peak (“overshoot”) followed by return to equilibrium infection levels sometimes occurs a year or less after mass drug administration. These patterns are usually assumed to be due to acquired immunity, which is induced by exposure, directed by the host's immune system, and develops slowly over the lifetime of the host. Other explanations that have been advanced previously include differential exposure of hosts, differential mortality of hosts, and progressive pathology. Here we review these explanations and offer a novel (but not mutually exclusive) explanation, namely that adult worms protect the host against larval stages for their own benefit (“concomitant immunity”) and that worm fecundity declines with worm age (“reproductive senescence”). This explanation approaches schistosomiasis from an eco-evolutionary perspective, as concomitant immunity maximizes the fitness of adult worms by reducing intraspecific competition within the host. If correct, our hypothesis could have profound implications for treatment and control of human schistosomiasis. Specifically, if immunity is worm-directed, then treatment of long-standing infections comprised of old senescent worms could enable infection with new, highly fecund worms. Furthermore, our hypothesis suggests revisiting research on therapeutics that mimic the concomitant immunity-modulating activity of adult worms, while minimizing pathological consequences of their eggs. We emphasize the value of an eco-evolutionary perspective on host-parasite interactions.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029194', 'afid': '60029194', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina Wilmington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wilmington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Buck J.C.', 'De Leo G.A.', 'Sokolow S.H.']","['22833405300', '7006105591', '8725138200']",aging | concomitant immunity | fecundity | model | overshoot | praziquantel | schistosoma | senescence,BMGF,OPP1114050,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,,1414102

Schistosomiasis is one of the most important and widespread neglected tropical diseases (NTD), with over 200 million people infected in more than 70 countries; the disease has nearly 800 million people at risk in endemic areas. Although mass drug administration is a cost-effective approach to reduce occurrence, extent, and severity of the disease, it does not provide protection to subsequent reinfection. Interventions that target the parasites' intermediate snail hosts are a crucial part of the integrated strategy required to move toward disease elimination. The recent revolution in gene drive technology naturally leads to questions about whether gene drives could be used to efficiently spread schistosome resistance traits in a population of snails and whether gene drives have the potential to contribute to reduced disease transmission in the long run. Responsible implementation of gene drives will require solutions to complex challenges spanning multiple disciplines, from biology to policy. This Review Article presents collected perspectives from practitioners of global health, genome engineering, epidemiology, and snail/schistosome biology and outlines strategies for responsible gene drive technology development, impact measurements of gene drives for schistosomiasis control, and gene drive governance. Success in this arena is a function of many factors, including gene-editing specificity and efficiency, the level of resistance conferred by the gene drive, how fast gene drives may spread in a metapopulation over a complex landscape, ecological sustainability, social equity, and, ultimately, the reduction of infection prevalence in humans. With combined efforts from across the broad global health community, gene drives for schistosomiasis control could fortify our defenses against this devastating disease in the future.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071181', 'afid': '60071181', 'affilname': 'Addis Ababa University', 'affiliation-city': 'Addis Ababa', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032838', 'afid': '60032838', 'affilname': 'Stanford University School of Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'Stanford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031101', 'afid': '60031101', 'affilname': 'University of Cambridge', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028186', 'afid': '60028186', 'affilname': 'Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'affiliation-city': 'Lausanne', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851', 'afid': '60026851', 'affilname': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025163', 'afid': '60025163', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123692868', 'afid': '123692868', 'affilname': 'Global Health Institute of Merck (KGaA)', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118268277', 'afid': '118268277', 'affilname': 'Global Schistosomiasis Alliance', 'affiliation-city': 'Munich', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}]",Journal,Review,"['Maier T.', 'Wheeler N.J.', 'Namigai E.K.O.', 'Tycko J.', 'Grewelle R.E.', 'Woldeamanuel Y.', 'Klohe K.', 'Perez-Saez J.', 'Sokolow S.H.', 'De Leo G.A.', 'Yoshino T.P.', 'Zamanian M.', 'Reinhard-Rupp J.']","['57201338167', '55317107300', '45661706200', '57204491073', '57189973251', '23011080500', '57193718805', '57142399100', '8725138200', '7006105591', '57216882917', '26436470100', '55607984900']",,NSF,1414102,National Science Foundation,,1414102

However, the trajectories of change expected to occur in tropical forest functional characteristics as a function of future climate variation are largely unknown. We modeled community level trait values of Costa Rican rain forests as a function of current and future climate, and quantified potential changes in functional composition. We calculated per-plot community weighted mean (CWM) trait values for leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, and wood basic specific gravity (WSG), for tree and palm species in 127 0.25 ha plots. We modeled the response of CWM traits to current temperature and precipitation gradients using generalized additive modeling. We then predicted and mapped CWM traits values under current and future climate, and quantified potential changes under a global warming scenario (RCP8.5, year 2050). We calculated the area within the multi trait functional space occupied by forest plots under both current and future climate, and determined potential changes in functional space occupied by forest plots. Overall, precipitation predicted CWM traits better than temperature. Models indicated increases in CWM SLA, N and P, and a decrease in CWM LDMC under climate change. Lowland forest communities converged on a single direction of change towards more acquisitive CWM trait values, indicating a change in forest functional composition resulting from a changed climate. Functional space occupied by forest plots was reduced by 50% under the future climate. Functional composition changes may have further effects on forests ecosystem services. Assessing functional trait spatial-gradients can help bridge the gap between species-based biogeography and biogeochemical approaches to strengthen biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation efforts.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071928', 'afid': '60071928', 'affilname': 'CATIE - Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza', 'affiliation-city': 'Turrialba', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033389', 'afid': '60033389', 'affilname': 'University of Idaho', 'affiliation-city': 'Moscow', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118354244', 'afid': '118354244', 'affilname': 'Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE), Turrialba, Costa Rica and Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security Program (CCAFS), International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)', 'affiliation-city': 'Hanoi', 'affiliation-country': 'Viet Nam'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chain-Guadarrama A.', 'Imbach P.', 'Vilchez-Mendoza S.', 'Vierling L.', 'Finegan B.']","['55351269800', '35487814900', '56183589300', '7004425841', '7006935009']",,,undefined,,,1313824

We use a landscape genetics approach to evaluate impacts of expanding pineapple plantations on two widespread and abundant frugivorous bats in a biological corridor in Costa Rica. We hypothesize that the larger, more mobile Artibeus jamaicensis will be less impacted by pineapple than the smaller Carollia castanea. In 2012 and 2013, we sampled 735 bats in 26 remnant forest patches surrounded by different proportions of forest, pasture, crops and pineapple. We used 10 microsatellite loci for A. jamaicensis and 16 microsatellite loci for C. castanea to estimate genetic diversity and gene flow. Canonical correspondence analyses indicate that land cover type surrounding patches has no impact on genetic diversity of A. jamaicensis. However, for C. castanea, both percentage forest and pineapple surrounding patches explained a significant proportion of the variation in genetic diversity. Least-cost transect analyses (LCTA) and pairwise G″st suggest that for A. jamaicensis, pineapple is more permeable to gene flow than expected, while as expected, forest is the most permeable land cover for gene flow of C. castanea. For both species, LCTA indicate that development may play a role in inhibiting gene flow. The current study answers the call for landscape genetic research focused on tropical and agricultural landscapes, highlights the value of comparative landscape genetics in biological corridor design and management and is one of the few studies of biological corridors in any ecosystem to implement a genetic approach to test corridor efficacy.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071928', 'afid': '60071928', 'affilname': 'CATIE - Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza', 'affiliation-city': 'Turrialba', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033389', 'afid': '60033389', 'affilname': 'University of Idaho', 'affiliation-city': 'Moscow', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026227', 'afid': '60026227', 'affilname': 'Clarkson University', 'affiliation-city': 'Potsdam', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cleary K.', 'Waits L.', 'Finegan B.']","['56640889200', '6701328434', '7006935009']",agricultural intensification | bats | biological corridor | landscape genetics | least-cost transect approach | tropical agricultural landscapes,BCI,1313824,Bat Conservation International,,1313824

In previous research, the SE-NW time-trend in the age of the earliest Neolithic sites across Europe has been treated as a signal of a global-scale process that brought farming/herding economies to the continent. Residual variation from this global time-trend is generally treated as 'noise'. A Complex Adaptive Systems perspective views this empirical record differently. The apparent time-trend is treated as an emergent consequence of the interactions of individuals and groups of different scale.Here, we examine the dynamics of agricultural dispersals, using the rich body evidence available from the Iberian Peninsula as a case study. We integrate two complementary approaches: (1) creating a high resolution Agent Based Modeling environment to simulate different processes that may have driven the spread of farming; (2) collecting and synthesizing empirical archeological data for the earliest Neolithic settlements that we use to evaluate our models results.Our results suggest that, (a) the source of radiocarbon data used to evaluate alternative hypotheses play an important role in the results; and (b) the model scenario that produces de best fit with archeological data implies a dispersal via northwestern and southern routes; a preference for leap-frog movement; an influence of ecological conditions (selecting most favorable agricultural land) and demographic factors (avoiding settled regions).This work represents a first attempt at high-resolution bottom-up modeling of this important dynamic in human prehistory.

We integrate modern spatial distributions of plant geographical regions with paleoclimatic trends to model vegetation change in the Southern Levant over the course of the mid-Holocene. This timespan witnessed the rise, collapse and redevelopment of urbanized society and settlement during the Bronze Age. This study applies GIS and statistical modeling tools (MAXENT) to vegetation data from 1696 historical and modern observation points across the region to chart potential vegetation for the present and at 100-year intervals between 5500 and 3000 calibrated years BP. A macrophysical climate model is used to create vegetation maps based on regional temperature and precipitation data. Environmental dynamics tracked over this time period, including past vegetation, temperature and precipitation, are applied to the interpretation of Bronze Age settlement and social change. Our results reveal a general trend of Mediterranean forest contraction through the Bronze Age. The ""4.2 event"" (ca. 4200 calibrated years BP) potentially links regional desiccation and urban collapse, and constitutes the last element in a trajectory of reduced potential forest vegetation through the Early Bronze Age.

The regional effects of global climate change varied spatially with latitude, topography, and distance from a shifting coastline; and human adaptations to these changes played out at these regional scales. To better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of climate change and human social-ecological-technological systems (or SETS) during the transition from full glacial to interglacial, we carried out a meta-analysis of archaeological and paleoenvironmental datasets across the western Mediterranean region. We compiled information on prehistoric technology, land-use, and hunting strategies from 291 archaeological assemblages, recovered from 122 sites extending from southern Spain, through Mediterranean France, to northern and peninsular Italy, as well as 2,386 radiocarbon dates from across this region. We combine these data on human ecological dynamics with paleoenvironmental information derived from global climate models, proxy data, and estimates of coastlines modeled from sea level estimates and digital terrain. The LGM represents an ecologically predictable period for over much of the western Mediterranean, while the remainder of the Pleistocene was increasingly unpredictable, making it a period of increased ecological risk for hunter-gatherers. In response to increasing spatial and temporal uncertainty, hunter-gatherers reorganized different constituents of their SETS, allowing regional populations to adapt to these conditions up to a point. Beyond this threshold, rapid environmental change resulted in significant demographic change in Mediterranean hunter-gatherer populations.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009507', 'afid': '60009507', 'affilname': 'University of Montreal', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002644', 'afid': '60002644', 'affilname': 'University of Valencia', 'affiliation-city': 'Valencia', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}]",Journal,Article,"['Barton C.', 'Aura Tortosa J.', 'Garcia-Puchol O.', 'Riel-Salvatore J.', 'Gauthier N.', 'Vadillo Conesa M.', 'Pothier Bouchard G.']","['7202585566', '8763728000', '26631621000', '24336108100', '57191247869', '56748105400', '57196058108']",Adaptation | Archaeology | Demography | Environmental uncertainty | Human ecology | Hunter-gatherers | Paleoclimate models | Paleolithic | Pleistocene-Holocene | Western Mediterranean,ASU,DEB-1313727,Arizona State University,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0277379117302615,1313727

The unprecedented use of Earth's resources by humans, in combination with increasing natural variability in natural processes over the past century, is affecting the evolution of the Earth system. To better understand natural processes and their potential future trajectories requires improved integration with and quantification of human processes. Similarly, to mitigate risk and facilitate socio-economic development requires a better understanding of how the natural system (e.g. climate variability and change, extreme weather events, and processes affecting soil fertility) affects human processes. Our understanding of these interactions and feedback between human and natural systems has been formalized through a variety of modelling approaches. However, a common conceptual framework or set of guidelines to model human-natural-system feedbacks is lacking. The presented research lays out a conceptual framework that includes representing model coupling configuration in combination with the frequency of interaction and coordination of communication between coupled models. Four different approaches used to couple representations of the human and natural system are presented in relation to this framework, which vary in the processes represented and in the scale of their application. From the development and experience associated with the four models of coupled human-natural systems, the following eight lessons were identified that if taken into account by future coupled human-natural-systems model developments may increase their success: (1) leverage the power of sensitivity analysis with models, (2) remember modelling is an iterative process, (3) create a common language, (4) make code open-access, (5) ensure consistency, (6) reconcile spatio-temporal mismatch, (7) construct homogeneous units, and (8) incorporating feedback increases non-linearity and variability. Following a discussion of feedbacks, a way forward to expedite model coupling and increase the longevity and interoperability of models is given, which suggests the use of a wrapper container software, a standardized applications programming interface (API), the incorporation of standard names, the mitigation of sunk costs by creating interfaces to multiple coupling frameworks, and the adoption of reproducible workflow environments to wire the pieces together.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117141', 'afid': '60117141', 'affilname': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Institute for Environmental Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107757', 'afid': '60107757', 'affilname': ""Scotland's Rural College"", 'affiliation-city': 'Edinburgh', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027314', 'afid': '60027314', 'affilname': 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Campus North', 'affiliation-city': 'Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027272', 'afid': '60027272', 'affilname': 'University of Edinburgh', 'affiliation-city': 'Edinburgh', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025288', 'afid': '60025288', 'affilname': 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum für Material- und Küstenforschung GmbH', 'affiliation-city': 'Geesthacht', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021243', 'afid': '60021243', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019702', 'afid': '60019702', 'affilname': 'University of Birmingham', 'affiliation-city': 'Birmingham', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171', 'afid': '60014171', 'affilname': 'University of Waterloo', 'affiliation-city': 'Waterloo', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007174', 'afid': '60007174', 'affilname': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Robinson D.', 'Di Vittorio A.', 'Alexander P.', 'Arneth A.', 'Michael Barton C.', 'Brown D.', 'Kettner A.', 'Lemmen C.', ""O'Neill B."", 'Janssen M.', 'Pugh T.', 'Rabin S.', 'Rounsevell M.', 'Syvitski J.', 'Ullah I.', 'Verburg P.']","['8295257200', '7801315376', '7202328941', '6701820813', '7202585566', '56975641800', '9039420300', '56247691800', '35234249500', '7202771294', '35265113300', '55807582000', '6602874462', '25946569800', '36092034700', '7003460110']",,BMBF,0621695,Luonnontieteiden ja Tekniikan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta,,1313727

From understanding our distant past to building systems of future, useful simulations demand 'efficient models'. Standing in the way is the twofold challenge of restraining complexity and scale of models. We describe these traits in view of component-based model development. We substantiate the roles complexity and scale play in view of modeling formalisms. We propose semi-formal modeling methods, in contrast to formal, are suitable for qualifying/quantifying model complexity and scale. For structural abstractions, we use class and component models. For behavioral abstractions, we use activity and state machines models. Furthermore, we consider these traits from the vantage point of having families of component-based models. We exemplify the concept and approach by developing families of DEVS models in the COSMOS framework supporting DEVS-based activity and state machines models that persist in relational databases across multiple model development sessions.

In these contexts, methods that can reveal occupational patterns at landscape scales, without the need to pinpoint specific sites of human occupation, can be especially useful. We employ a stratified, randomly selected patch-based survey strategy to examine socio-ecological dynamics from the Middle Paleolithic through Bell Beaker (Chalcolithic) periods within the Canal de Navarrés, eastern Spain. We divide the study region into survey strata according to differences in topography and vegetation communities and use a random selection of demarcated, terraced fields as data collection patches. All survey data is digitally recorded using tablets in the field, creating a streamlined and more accurate workflow, where observations of artifacts, soils, ground visibility, and photographs are georeferenced and ready for analysis in a GIS. Surface artifact densities, estimated from sampled patches, are used to generate prehistoric land-use maps and empirical Bayesian methods allow us to track shifts in occupational patterns through time. Regional reference collections of well-dated lithic artifacts provide the “prior knowledge” required to make estimates of the probability of prehistoric occupation in each sampled patch. This combination of field and analytical methods makes possible the study of regional-scale land-use dynamics in agriculturally modified landscapes.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002644', 'afid': '60002644', 'affilname': 'University of Valencia', 'affiliation-city': 'Valencia', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}]",Journal,Article,"['Snitker G.', 'Castillo A.', 'Barton C.', 'Aubán J.', 'Puchol O.', 'Pardo-Gordó S.']","['57192401874', '57210862555', '7202585566', '57214357995', '26631621000', '56366351600']",Bayesian methods | Digital data collection | Mediterranean basin | Off-site methods | Patch-based survey | Spain,METI,-131372,"Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1040618217307103,1313727

Land-use change can have profound effects on forest communities, compromising seedling recruitment and growth, and long-term persistence of forests on the landscape. Continued forest conversion to agriculture causes forest fragmentation which decreases forest size, increases edge effects and forest isolation, all of which negatively impact forest health. These fragmentation effects are magnified by human use of forests, which can compromise the continued persistence of species in these forests and the ability of the forests to support the communities that depend on them. We examined the extent and influence of human disturbance (e.g. weedy taxa, native and exotic tree plantations, clearings, buildings) on the ecological status of sacred church forests in the northern highlands of South Gondar, Ethiopia and hypothesized that disturbance would have a negative effect. We found that disturbance was high across all forests (56%) and was negatively associated with tree species richness, density, and biomass and seedling richness and density. Contrary to expectation, we found that forests < 15.5 ha show no difference in disturbance level with distance from population center. Based on our findings, we recommend that local conservation strategies not only protect large forests, but also the small and highly used forests in South Gondar which are critical to the needs of local people, including preserving large trees for seed sources, removing exotic and weedy species from forests, and reducing clearings and trails within forests.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071189', 'afid': '60071189', 'affilname': 'Bahar Dar University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bahar Dar', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017502', 'afid': '60017502', 'affilname': 'University of Puget Sound', 'affiliation-city': 'Tacoma', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016662', 'afid': '60016662', 'affilname': 'Colgate University', 'affiliation-city': 'Hamilton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cardelús C.', 'Woods C.', 'Mekonnen A.', 'Dexter S.', 'Scull P.', 'Tsegay B.']","['8633015600', '25642210600', '57207619753', '57207580845', '8776355100', '8395120200']",,NIIST,undefined,National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology,,1518501

We use a multitemporal dataset of very high-resolution remote sensing images to map kiln locations in a representative study area of tropical woodlands in central Mozambique. The resulting maps provided a characterization of the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of charcoal production. Using an indirect approach we combine kiln maps and field information on charcoal making to describe the magnitude and intensity of forest degradation linked to charcoal production, including aboveground biomass and carbon emissions. Our findings reveal that forest degradation associated to charcoal production in the study area is largely independent from deforestation driven by agricultural expansion and that its impact on forest cover change is in the same order of magnitude as deforestation. Our work illustrates the feasibility of using estimates of urban charcoal consumption to establish a link between urban energy demands and forest degradation. This kind of approach has potential to reduce uncertainties in forest cover change and carbon emission assessments in sub-Saharan Africa.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122177', 'afid': '60122177', 'affilname': 'Pedagogical University', 'affiliation-city': 'Maputo', 'affiliation-country': 'Mozambique'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006337', 'afid': '60006337', 'affilname': 'NASA Goddard Space Flight Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Greenbelt', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117559158', 'afid': '117559158', 'affilname': 'Mozambican Ministry of Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mozambique'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114798866', 'afid': '114798866', 'affilname': 'UEM', 'affiliation-city': 'Maputo', 'affiliation-country': 'Mozambique'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sedano F.', 'Silva J.A.', 'Machoco R.', 'Meque C.H.', 'Sitoe A.', 'Ribeiro N.', 'Anderson K.', 'Ombe Z.A.', 'Baule S.H.', 'Tucker C.J.']","['8954991600', '16444963500', '57191616529', '57191610892', '6504307410', '23467861400', '57208510921', '35410153800', '57191622909', '7201903057']",Africa | carbon emissions | charcoal | forest degradation | remote sensing | very high-resolution,,undefined,,,1413999

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / THE WORLD BANK. Devolving property rights to local institutions has emerged as a compelling management strategy for natural resource management in developing countries. The use of property rights among fishing cooperatives operating in Mexico's Gulf of California provides a compelling setting for theoretical and empirical analysis. A dynamic theoretical model demonstrates how fishing cooperatives' management choices are shaped by the presence of property rights, the mobility of resources, and predictable environmental fluctuations. More aggressive management comes in the form of the cooperative leadership paying lower prices to cooperative members for their catch, as lower prices disincentivize fishing effort. The model's implications are empirically tested using three years of daily logbook data on prices and catches for three cooperatives from the Gulf of California. One cooperative enjoys property rights while the other two do not. There is empirical evidence in support of the model: compared to the other cooperatives, the cooperative with strong property rights pays members a lower price, pays especially lower prices for less mobile species, and decreases prices when environmental fluctuations cause population growth rates to fall. The results from this case study demonstrate the viability of cooperative management of resources but also point toward quantitatively important limitations created by the mismatch between the scale of a property right and the scale of a resource.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023018', 'afid': '60023018', 'affilname': 'Scripps Institution of Oceanography', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017383', 'afid': '60017383', 'affilname': 'Nature Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010534', 'afid': '60010534', 'affilname': 'The Brookings Institution', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114883967', 'afid': '114883967', 'affilname': 'California Ocean Science Trust', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100875056', 'afid': '100875056', 'affilname': 'Acumen, LLC', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Aburto-Oropeza O.', 'Leslie H.', 'Mack-Crane A.', 'Nagavarapu S.', 'Reddy S.', 'Sievanen L.']","['6506774995', '7003357768', '57194542140', '55762756600', '55762848900', '8578856800']",,,undefined,,,1632648

Their biological characteristics, including very large size, slow growth, longevity, late age-at-maturity and the tendency to form spawning aggregations makes them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. In Baja California, Mexico, the lack of robust historical catch data and fishery independent estimates of abundance hinders the assessment of temporal trends in population size and the evaluation of grouper population dynamics, as well the development and implementation of adequate management plans. Using an interdisciplinary approach that included (1) the review of non-scientific historical documents, (2) analysis of official catch records, (3) interviews with three generations of fishermen and (4) visual censuses to estimate abundance and the current size distribution, we reconstructed the historical abundance and maximum sizes of six species of Serranids of the genera Epinephelus and Mycteroperca as well as Stereolepis gigas in the Magdalena-Almejas Bay lagoonal complex in northwestern Mexico. Although catch volumes increased by 225% during the last 13 years, fishermen perception indicated a 30% decrease in the estimated maximum size and 57% decrease in the maximum weight captured over the past four decades. Based on insight gained from the four approaches, the general trend suggested an overall decrease in the abundance of some species. However, these changes were not perceived equally by the three generations of interviewed fishers; only older fishermen (>55 years of age) perceived a drastic decrease in population size. It is therefore important to involve young fishers in educational programs to avoid incurring in a shifting baseline syndrome. The limited quantitative data available for the region coupled with a trend toward lower abundance and smaller maximum sizes makes the implementation of specific monitoring and management measures for these species imperative.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032563', 'afid': '60032563', 'affilname': 'Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada', 'affiliation-city': 'Ensenada', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023018', 'afid': '60023018', 'affilname': 'Scripps Institution of Oceanography', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019769', 'afid': '60019769', 'affilname': 'AZTI Fundazioa', 'affiliation-city': 'Derio', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019176', 'afid': '60019176', 'affilname': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional', 'affiliation-city': 'Mexico City', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Erauskin-Extramiana M.', 'Herzka S.', 'Hinojosa-Arango G.', 'Aburto-Oropeza O.']","['57194239268', '6506986974', '6508032634', '6506774995']",Catch data | Fishermen interviews | Giant sea bass | Groupers | Historical reconstruction,CONACYT,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0964569117304726,1632648

No-take marine reserves can be powerful management tools, but only if they are well designed and effectively managed. We review how ecological guidelines for improving marine reserve design can be adapted based on an area’s unique evolutionary, oceanic, and ecological characteristics in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We provide ecological guidelines to maximize benefits for fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation. These guidelines include: representing 30% of each major habitat (and multiple examples of each) in marine reserves within each of three biogeographic subregions; protecting critical areas in the life cycle of focal species (spawning and nursery areas) and sites with unique biodiversity; and establishing reserves in areas where local threats can be managed effectively. Given that strong, asymmetric oceanic currents reverse direction twice a year, to maximize connectivity on an ecological time scale, reserves should be spaced less than 50–200 km apart depending on the planktonic larval duration of target species; and reserves should be located upstream of fishing sites, taking the reproductive timing of focal species in consideration. Reserves should be established for the long term, preferably permanently, since full recovery of all fisheries species is likely to take > 25 years. Reserve size should be based on movement patterns of focal species, although marine reserves > 10 km long are likely to protect ~ 80% of fish species. Since climate change will affect species’ geographic range, larval duration, growth, reproduction, abundance, and distribution of key recruitment habitats, these guidelines may require further modifications to maintain ecosystem function in the future.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121576', 'afid': '60121576', 'affilname': 'Marine Biology Research Division', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60099904', 'afid': '60099904', 'affilname': 'Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC', 'affiliation-city': 'Guaymas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032563', 'afid': '60032563', 'affilname': 'Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada', 'affiliation-city': 'Ensenada', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031287', 'afid': '60031287', 'affilname': 'Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022462', 'afid': '60022462', 'affilname': 'University of New England, USA', 'affiliation-city': 'Biddeford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017383', 'afid': '60017383', 'affilname': 'Nature Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010365', 'afid': '60010365', 'affilname': 'The University of British Columbia', 'affiliation-city': 'Vancouver', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003723', 'afid': '60003723', 'affilname': 'NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114912051', 'afid': '114912051', 'affilname': 'Sociedad de Historia Natural Niparajá', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110586468', 'afid': '110586468', 'affilname': 'Pronatura Noroeste A.C.', 'affiliation-city': 'Ensenada', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106163632', 'afid': '106163632', 'affilname': 'Centro Intercultural de Estudios de Desiertos y Océanos (CEDO)', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Review,"['Munguia-Vega A.', 'Green A.', 'Suarez-Castillo A.', 'Espinosa-Romero M.', 'Aburto-Oropeza O.', 'Cisneros-Montemayor A.', 'Cruz-Piñón G.', 'Danemann G.', 'Giron-Nava A.', 'Gonzalez-Cuellar O.', 'Lasch C.', 'del Mar Mancha-Cisneros M.', 'Marinone S.', 'Moreno-Báez M.', 'Morzaria-Luna H.', 'Reyes-Bonilla H.', 'Torre J.', 'Turk-Boyer P.', 'Walther M.', 'Weaver A.']","['22035625600', '7404024579', '56055482400', '37004325900', '6506774995', '36094057100', '6506334781', '6508256234', '56315895400', '55816438800', '25644412100', '56138565300', '6701695661', '36024357500', '6506759470', '6701446814', '8941306800', '25947826700', '57203011685', '55993388700']",Biodiversity | Climate change | Connectivity | Conservation | Fisheries | Recovery rates,TNC,undefined,Walton Family Foundation,,1632648
85035223439,2-s2.0-85035223439,Anisotropic larval connectivity and metapopulation structure driven by directional oceanic currents in a marine fish targeted by small-scale fisheries,Marine Biology,00253162,,,165,1,,2018-01-01,10.1007/s00227-017-3267-x,"© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. The dispersal during the planktonic larval period is a key feature to understand the metapopulation structure of marine fishes, and is commonly described by four general models: (1) lack of population structure due to extensive larval dispersal; (2) isolation by geographic distance, where larval connectivity decreases with increasing distance between sites in all directions (isotropy); (3) population structure without any clear geographic trend (chaotic); and (4) population structure explained by seascape approaches that explicitly incorporate the spatial and temporal variations in the direction and strength of oceanic currents via oceanographic modeling. We tested the four models in the Pacific red snapper Lutjanus peru, a key commercial species in the Gulf of California (GC), Mexico. We genotyped 15 microsatellite loci in 225 samples collected during 2015–2016 from 8 sites, and contrasted the observed empirical genetic patterns against predictions from each model. We found low but significant levels of population structure among sites. Only the seascape approach was able to significantly explain levels of genetic structure and diversity, but exclusively within spring and summer, suggesting that this period represents the spawning season for L. peru. We showed that in the GC, the strong asymmetry in the oceanic currents causes larval connectivity to show different values when measured in distinct directions (anisotropy). Management tools, including marine reserves, could be more effective if placed upstream of the predominant flow. Managers should consider that oceanographic distances describing the direction and intensity of currents during the spawning period are significant predictors of larval connectivity between sites, as opposed to geographic distances.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121576', 'afid': '60121576', 'affilname': 'Marine Biology Research Division', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60099904', 'afid': '60099904', 'affilname': 'Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC', 'affiliation-city': 'Guaymas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032563', 'afid': '60032563', 'affilname': 'Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada', 'affiliation-city': 'Ensenada', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031287', 'afid': '60031287', 'affilname': 'Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019176', 'afid': '60019176', 'affilname': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional', 'affiliation-city': 'Mexico City', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004432', 'afid': '60004432', 'affilname': 'Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114912051', 'afid': '114912051', 'affilname': 'Sociedad de Historia Natural Niparajá', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Munguia-Vega A.', 'Marinone S.', 'Paz-Garcia D.', 'Giron-Nava A.', 'Plomozo-Lugo T.', 'Gonzalez-Cuellar O.', 'Weaver A.', 'García-Rodriguez F.', 'Reyes-Bonilla H.']","['22035625600', '6701695661', '12800693700', '56315895400', '30567690200', '55816438800', '55993388700', '7004619950', '6701446814']",,,2011-1235,Walton Family Foundation,,1632648

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. If efforts to conserve endangered species lack long-term visions and neglect the human dimensions, conservation success will be questionable. Exclusion of stakeholders in decisions can lead to mistrust and polarization of groups. The story of the vaquita marina (Phocoena sinus) in the Upper Gulf of California provides a unique opportunity to discuss this paradigm. A proposed gear-switch in the regional fisheries addresses the bycatch issue that threatens the vaquita but neglects livelihoods, the traditions and heritage of the community, and the ecological integrity of the area, and it increases dependence on fishing subsidies. We estimate that it will cost an additional US $8.5 million (2/3 of the net revenue produced by gillnets and 30% more in fuel consumption) if local revenues are to be maintained at pregear-switch levels. Additionally, suggested new trawl gears caught 2.7 times more unusable (therefore discarded) bycatch than gillnets, which included invertebrates and small juvenile fishes of economically valuable and endangered species. Our results show that the proposed gear switch intervention can be considered another “quick-fix” intervention in the history of the vaquita conservation agenda that urgently needs long-term goals that adequately incorporate ecological, economic, and human well-being.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121576', 'afid': '60121576', 'affilname': 'Marine Biology Research Division', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029526', 'afid': '60029526', 'affilname': 'University of California, Riverside', 'affiliation-city': 'Riverside', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109494260', 'afid': '109494260', 'affilname': 'Centro para la Biodiversidad Marina y la Conservación', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Aburto-Oropeza O.', 'López-Sagástegui C.', 'Moreno-Báez M.', 'Mascareñas-Osorio I.', 'Jiménez-Esquivel V.', 'Johnson A.', 'Erisman B.']","['6506774995', '56514128500', '36024357500', '36439767300', '56514086200', '7410014990', '16315329300']",Bycatch | conservation | economics | extinction | fisheries | shrimp | trawling | Upper Gulf of California | vaquita marina,EDF,DEB-1632648,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,,1632648

Ichthyoplankton studies can provide valuable information on the species richness and spawning activity of fishes, complementing estimations done using trawls and diver surveys. Zooplankton samples were collected weekly between January and December 2014 in Cabo Pulmo National Park, Gulf of California, Mexico (n = 48). Ichthyoplankton is difficult to identify morphologically; therefore the DNA barcoding method was employed to identify 4388 specimens, resulting in 157 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to species. Scarus sp., Halichoeres dispilus, Xyrichtys mundiceps, Euthynnus lineatus, Ammodytoides gilli, Synodus lacertinus, Etrumeus acuminatus, Chanos chanos, Haemulon flaviguttatum and Vinciguerria lucetia were the most abundant and frequent species recorded. Noteworthy species identified include rare mesopelagic species such as the giant oarfish Regalecus glesne and highly migratory and commercially important species such as black skipjack Euthynnus lineatus and yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares. Spawning activities showed distinct seasonal patterns, with the highest abundance of ichthyoplankton recorded during spring, highest species richness during summer (90 OTUs) and lowest species richness during winter (28 OTUs). A total of 7 OTUs were recorded throughout the year (4.5%), 10 OTUs during 3 seasons (6.5%), 36 OTUs in 2 seasons (23%) and 104 OTUs were recorded in 1 season (66%). The study found eggs and/or larvae of 47 species that were not previously reported in Cabo Pulmo National Park. The results will allow resource managers to compare shifting populations and spawning patterns of species that may be affected by both conservation efforts and broader oceanographic changes associated with climate change.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121576', 'afid': '60121576', 'affilname': 'Marine Biology Research Division', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004432', 'afid': '60004432', 'affilname': 'Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120478143', 'afid': '120478143', 'affilname': 'Cabo Pulmo National Park', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ahern A.', 'Gómez-Gutiérrez J.', 'Aburto-Oropeza O.', 'Saldierna-Martínez R.', 'Johnson A.', 'Harada A.', 'Sánchez-Uvera A.', 'Erisman B.', 'Arvizú D.', 'Burton R.']","['57201420980', '7004517058', '6506774995', '6506939997', '7410014990', '56890492500', '57201425323', '16315329300', '57201420283', '7402130360']",Cabo pulmo national park | DNA barcoding | Gulf of California | Marine conservation | Marine protected area | Mexico | Molecular ecology,NSF,DEB-1632648,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,,1632648

Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatán, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16 months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron–client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron–client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron–client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-à-vis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bennett A.', 'Basurto X.']","['55993025200', '8508409300']",cooperatives | local institutions | market pressures | patron–client relationships | sea cucumber fisheries | small-scale fisheries,IAF,G14120058,Duke University,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0305750X15307166,1632648

We describe the structure and historic landings of the Punta Abreojos fishing cooperative (Baja California Sur, Mexico) for the period between 2001 and 2015 to understand the dynamics of an economically and ecologically successful coastal fishing community according to catches and the direct income of fishers. A total of 21 commercial species were classified into three major groups: cultural resources, target resources and complementary resources. The most important resource in terms of total biomass was Paralabrax nebulifer (58.4%), followed by Panulirus interruptus and P. inflatus (13.6%). Seriola lalandi, Atractoscion nobilis, Caulolatilus princeps, Paralichtys californicus and P. woolmani made up minor proportions of the total biomass contributing 7.0%, 5.7%, 3.4% and 3.2% respectively. Haliotis fulgens and H. corrugata represented just 1.1% of the total biomass caught. Lobsters were the most profitable source of direct income for fisherman (77.5%), followed by the green and pink abalone (10.4%), barred sand bass (5.6%), white seabass (2.7%), California and speckled flounder (1.2%), yellowtail (1%) and whitefish (0.4%). The rest of the catch was composed of six species of finfish that represented 4.1% of the total catch biomass and 0.4% of the revenues from fishing. This work provides a first clear base-line description of the fisheries in Punta Abreojos which implements a management program that aims to ensure the wellbeing of the fishers and the fishery. The cooperative has been successful in maintaining catch at levels considered optimal to sustain revenues and continued annual landings. A management and cooperative structure that allows for adaptive change whilst maintaining revenues of the fishers is testament to the stewardship of the community and the participatory management upon which the community is built. For this reason, Punta Abreojos should be considered an example of a successful small-scale fishing cooperative that other, less successful fishing groups, can learn from.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121585', 'afid': '60121585', 'affilname': 'Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022462', 'afid': '60022462', 'affilname': 'University of New England, USA', 'affiliation-city': 'Biddeford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019176', 'afid': '60019176', 'affilname': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional', 'affiliation-city': 'Mexico City', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cota-Nieto J.', 'Erisman B.', 'Aburto-Oropeza O.', 'Moreno-Báez M.', 'Hinojosa-Arango G.', 'Johnson A.']","['44561025100', '16315329300', '6506774995', '36024357500', '6508032634', '7410014990']",Coastal fishing | Complementary resources | Cultural | Participatory management | Punta Abreojos | Target,NSF,DEB-1632648,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2352485517304292,1632648

Hydroacoustic technologies are widely used in fisheries research but few studies have used them to examine the effects of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). We evaluate the efficacy of hydroacoustics to examine the effects of closure to fishing and habitat type on fish populations in the Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP), Mexico, and compare these methods to Underwater Visual Censuses (UVC). Fish density, biomass and size were all significantly higher inside the CPNP (299%, 144% and 52% respectively) than outside in non-MPA control areas. These values were much higher when only accounting for the reefs within the CPNP (4715%, 6970% and 97% respectively) highlighting the importance of both habitat complexity and protection from fishing for fish populations. Acoustic estimates of fish biomass over reef-specific sites did not differ significantly from those estimated using UVC data, although acoustic densities were less due to higher numbers of small fish recorded by UVC. There is thus considerable merit in nesting UVC surveys, also providing species information, within hydroacoustic surveys. This study is a valuable starting point in demonstrating the utility of hydroacoustics to assess the effects of coastal MPAs on fish populations, something that has been underutilised in MPA design, formation and management.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121576', 'afid': '60121576', 'affilname': 'Marine Biology Research Division', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025779', 'afid': '60025779', 'affilname': 'Bangor University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bangor', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109494260', 'afid': '109494260', 'affilname': 'Centro para la Biodiversidad Marina y la Conservación', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Egerton J.', 'Johnson A.', 'Turner J.', 'LeVay L.', 'Mascareñas-Osorio I.', 'Aburto-Oropeza O.']","['57192990957', '7410014990', '57212569984', '8595143600', '36439767300', '6506774995']",,NSF,DEB 1632648,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,,1632648

By using time series from the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science Continuous Plankton Recorder, we demonstrate that longterm observations reveal both the prevalence of nonlinear processes in species abundances and an improvement in out-of-sample predictability as the number of observations increase.

All rights reserved. Rising inequalities and accelerating global environmental change pose two of the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century. To explore how these phenomena are linked, we apply a social-ecological systems perspective and review the literature to identify six different types of interactions (or ""pathways"") between inequality and the biosphere. We find that most of the research so far has only considered one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa. However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the biosphere. This review draws on diverse disciplines to advance a systemic understanding of the linkages between inequality and the biosphere, specifically recognizing cross-scale feedbacks and the multidimensional nature of inequality.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117804', 'afid': '60117804', 'affilname': 'The University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy', 'affiliation-city': 'Chicago', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071928', 'afid': '60071928', 'affilname': 'CATIE - Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza', 'affiliation-city': 'Turrialba', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071612', 'afid': '60071612', 'affilname': 'Universidad de la Republica', 'affiliation-city': 'Montevideo', 'affiliation-country': 'Uruguay'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029489', 'afid': '60029489', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Anchorage', 'affiliation-city': 'Anchorage', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028717', 'afid': '60028717', 'affilname': 'Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München', 'affiliation-city': 'Munich', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027152', 'afid': '60027152', 'affilname': 'Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Uppsala', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026479', 'afid': '60026479', 'affilname': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliation-city': 'Exeter', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025984', 'afid': '60025984', 'affilname': 'WorldFish', 'affiliation-city': 'Penang,', 'affiliation-country': 'Malaysia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025408', 'afid': '60025408', 'affilname': 'Finnish Environment Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Helsinki', 'affiliation-country': 'Finland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017563', 'afid': '60017563', 'affilname': 'Weizmann Institute of Science Israel', 'affiliation-city': 'Rehovot', 'affiliation-country': 'Israel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016437', 'afid': '60016437', 'affilname': 'Göteborgs Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Gothenburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010177', 'afid': '60010177', 'affilname': 'University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006297', 'afid': '60006297', 'affilname': 'University of Pennsylvania', 'affiliation-city': 'Philadelphia', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of New York Academy of Sciences. Environmental conservation initiatives, including marine protected areas (MPAs), have proliferated in recent decades. Designed to conserve marine biodiversity, many MPAs also seek to foster sustainable development. As is the case for many other environmental policies and programs, the impacts of MPAs are poorly understood. Social–ecological systems, impact evaluation, and common-pool resource governance are three complementary scientific frameworks for documenting and explaining the ecological and social impacts of conservation interventions. We review key components of these three frameworks and their implications for the study of conservation policy, program, and project outcomes. Using MPAs as an illustrative example, we then draw upon these three frameworks to describe an integrated approach for rigorous empirical documentation and causal explanation of conservation impacts. This integrated three-framework approach for impact evaluation of governance in social–ecological systems (3FIGS) accounts for alternative explanations, builds upon and advances social theory, and provides novel policy insights in ways that no single approach affords. Despite the inherent complexity of social–ecological systems and the difficulty of causal inference, the 3FIGS approach can dramatically advance our understanding of, and the evidentiary basis for, effective MPAs and other conservation initiatives.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60151531', 'afid': '60151531', 'affilname':

Despite this, we are not much closer to predicting recruitment. Rather, recent analyses suggest that recruitment is virtually independent of stock size and, instead, seems to occur in distinct environmental regimes. This issue of whether or not recruitment and subsequent production are coupled to stock size is highly relevant to management. Here, we apply empirical dynamical modelling (EDM) to a global database of 185 fish populations to address the questions of whether or not variation in recruitment is (a) predictable and (b) coupled to stock size. We find that a substantial fraction of recruitment variation is predictable using only the observed history of fluctuations (~40% on average). In addition, although recruitment is often coupled to stock size (107 of 185 stocks), stock size alone explains very little of the variation in recruitment; In ~90% of the stocks analysed, EDM forecasts have substantially lower prediction error than models based solely on stock size. We find that predictability varies across taxa and improves with the number of generations that have been sampled. In the light of these results, we suggest that EDM will be of greatest use in managing relatively short-lived species.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029222', 'afid': '60029222', 'affilname': 'NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center Santa Cruz Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023018', 'afid': '60023018', 'affilname': 'Scripps Institution of Oceanography', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Munch S.', 'Giron-Nava A.', 'Sugihara G.']","['7004701292', '56315895400', '7005912152']",empirical dynamical modelling | gaussian process regression | recruitment | time-delay embedding,NSF,DEB-1020372,National Science Foundation,,1632648

We have developed a bio-economic fishery model to address the pressing need of managing the interplay of different markets. We first regard local, multi-level and global markets individually and then analyze the effect of transitioning between markets on the exploitation of species and the stability of income. We find that in gradually globalizing markets, transition management needs to account for non-linear price changes since earlier policies may not be suitable after globalization. We hypothesize that short-term policies to ban harvest in the interest of species recovery benefit a local market in which incentives prevent overharvesting. In global markets we expect that sustained initiatives are needed to prevent overharvesting.

External drivers increasingly impact small-scale fisheries worldwide. As globalization accelerates the flow of information, commodities, and capital across geographic space, neoliberal reforms have fueled the development of the international seafood trade. Small-scale fisheries traditionally driven by local forces and market demands are increasingly nested within the broader structures of global markets and international institutions. Building on existing work that integrates social-ecological systems thinking and critical social science theory, we address how globalization has transformed the social fabric of coastal fishing communities and consider the implications for institutional and environmental integrity. Using small-scale fisheries across the Gulf of California as an empirical example, we extend a theory of small-scale fisheries interactions proposed by development scholars to incorporate global market forces, considering how drivers operating at multiple temporal and geographic scales have influenced outcomes in one of the world’s most diverse and productive marine ecosystems. We suggest that neoliberal reforms promoting the growth and development of an export-oriented seafood industry have restructured the relationships between small-scale fishermen, coastal communities, and the marine environment. As the benefits of trade liberalization have been captured by local elites, small-scale fishermen have been left increasingly vulnerable to the shocks and uncertainties associated with political, economic, and environmental change. By situating our findings within an emerging body of scholarship documenting parallel dynamics across diverse geographies, we argue that efforts to avoid and/ or mitigate the tragedy of the commons within small-scale fishery systems must address the relationships between global markets, social and economic inequality, and local capacities for self-organization and collective action.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Frawley T.', 'Finkbeiner E.', 'Crowder L.']","['57195630375', '37078985800', '7005270269']",Globalization | Gulf of California | Neoliberal reform | Small-scale fisheries | Social-ecological systems,,undefined,,,1632648

All rights reserved. Interannual oceanic oscillations, climate change, and extreme events present a significant and complex challenge to management of pelagic fisheries. In recent years, anomalous oceanographic and atmospheric conditions have been reported across the northeast Pacific, yet research results concerning the biophysical mechanisms impacting specific organisms, populations, and fishery systems remain scarce. Here we discuss trends within the Gulf of California's jumbo squid fishery in the context of relevant climate drivers, ecological dynamics, and mesoscale oceanographic processes. Following the 2009-2010 El Niño event, the jig-based fishery collapsed as squid adopted the small size-at-maturity phenotype characteristic of this species in the equatorial portion of its range. Analysis of regional sea surface temperatures and heights indicates a pronounced shift in the oceanographic trajectory of the system between the 2009-2010 and 2015-2016 El Niño events, whereas in situ hydrographic sampling reveals coincident changes in subsurface temperature and salinity. With persistently tropical oceanic conditions present across critical portions of their pelagic habitat, jumbo squid have lost access to previously productive coastal foraging zones, which in turn has limited opportunities for fishery recovery. Given the importance of jumbo squid to the region's pelagic marine foodwebs, the long-term persistence of such phenomena could have significant implications for local fisheries, economies, and livelihoods.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024594', 'afid': '60024594', 'affilname': 'National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand', 'affiliation-city': 'Auckland', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195', 'afid': '60022195', 'affilname': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011003', 'afid': '60011003', 'affilname': 'Moss Landing Marine Laboratories', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Frawley T.H.', 'Briscoe D.K.', 'Daniel P.C.', 'Britten G.L.', 'Crowder L.B.', 'Robinson C.J.', 'Gilly W.F.', 'Arkhipkin A.']","['57195630375', '56625683700', '55660360400', '36627008000', '7005270269', '7403374845', '7004245063', '7005344316']",Guaymas Basin | Gulf of California | jumbo squid | spatially explicit oceanography | subsurface warming,,undefined,,,1632648

The importance of understanding how social-ecological interdependencies deriving from global trade influence sustainability has been argued for decades. Even if substantial progress has been made, a research gap remains regarding how the adaptability of small-scale fish buyers, whose daily operations have implications for the livelihood of more than 100 million people, are affected by networks of trade relationships. Adaptability is here defined as fish buyers´ abilities to adapt using their relationships with others. We elaborate how these capacities relate to the precise patterns in which a fish buyer is entangled with other fish buyers, with the fishers, and with the targeted fish species, by combining a multilevel social-ecological network model with empirical data from a small-scale fishery in Mexico. Further, we also identify types of fish buyers distinguishable by how they operate, and how they are embedded in the trading network. Our results suggest that adaptability differs substantially amongst these types, thus implying that fish buyers' abilities to respond to changes are unevenly distributed. This study demonstrates the need for a more profound understanding of the consequences of the different ways in which fish buyers operate commercially, and how these operations are affected by patterns of social and social-ecological interdependencies.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020096', 'afid': '60020096', 'affilname': 'Duke University Marine Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Beaufort', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

To explore how these phenomena are linked, we apply a social-ecological systems perspective and review the literature to identify six different types of interactions (or ""pathways"") between inequality and the biosphere. We find that most of the research so far has only considered one-directional effects of inequality on the biosphere, or vice versa. However, given the potential for complex dynamics between socioeconomic and environmental factors within social-ecological systems, we highlight examples from the literature that illustrate the importance of cross-scale interactions and feedback loops between inequality and the biosphere.

Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems. Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts, transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures, and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts, traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena, enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082291', 'afid': '60082291', 'affilname': 'The Fenner School of Environment &amp; Society', 'affiliation-city': 'Canberra', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

We argue this trickery complicates notions of social capital in community-based natural resource management, which emphasize communitarianism in the form of trust. Trust, defined as a mutual dependability often rooted in honesty, reliable information, or shared expectations, has long been recognized as essential to common pool resource management. Despite this, research that takes a critical approach to social capital places attention on the activities that foster social networks and their norms by arguing that social capital is a process. A critical approach illuminates San Evaristeño practices of lying and joking across social settings and contextualizes these practices within cultural values of harmony. As San Evaristeños assert somewhat paradoxically, for them “lies build trust.” Importantly, a critical approach to this case study forces consideration of gender, an overlooked topic in social capital research. San Evaristeña women are excluded from the verbal jousting through which men maintain ties supporting their primacy in fishery management. Both men's joke-telling and San Evaristeños’ aversion to conflict have implications for conservation outcomes. As a result, we use these findings to help explain local resistance to outsiders and external management strategies including land trusts, fishing cooperatives, and marine protected areas.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Siegelman B.', 'Haenn N.', 'Basurto X.']","['57209659583', '6507323653', '8508409300']",Common pool resources | Community-based natural resource management | Feminist political ecology | Latin America | Small-scale fisheries | Social capital,TFI,-1632648,Tinker Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0305750X19301779,1632648

Over the last 10 years, the number of marine SCP studies has increased exponentially, yet there is no structured or reliable way to find information on methods, trends, and progress. The rapid growth in methods and marine applications warrants an updated analysis of the literature, as well as reflection on the need for continuous and systematic documentation of SCP exercises in general. To address these gaps, we developed a database to document SCP exercises and populated it with 155 marine SCP exercises found in the primary literature. Based on our review, we provide an update on global advances and trends in marine SCP literature. We found accelerating growth in the number of studies over the past decade, with increasing consideration of socioeconomic variables, land-sea planning, and ecological connectivity. While several studies aimed to inform conservation decisions, we found little evidence of input from practitioners. There are important gaps in geographic coverage and little correspondence with areas most threatened. Five countries lead most studies, but their networks suggest potential for capacity building through collaborations. The varying quality and detail in documentation of studies confirmed the limited opportunities to develop and assess the application of best practice in conservation planning. A global database to track the development, implementation, and impact of SCP applications can thus provide numerous benefits. Our database constitutes an important step towards the development of a centralized repository of information on planning exercises and can serve several roles to advance SCP theory and practice: it facilitates assessing geographic coverage and gaps; scientists and practitioners can access information to identify trends in the use of data, methods, and tools; reviewers and editors of journals can assess whether studies have covered important literature and developments; donors and non-government organizations can identify regions needing further work; and practitioners and policy-makers can learn from previous plans.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015356', 'afid': '60015356', 'affilname': 'University of Tasmania', 'affiliation-city': 'Hobart', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150', 'afid': '60015150', 'affilname': 'Imperial College London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008090', 'afid': '60008090', 'affilname': 'BirdLife International', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003122', 'afid': '60003122', 'affilname': 'University of Victoria', 'affiliation-city': 'Victoria', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/107864628', 'afid': '107864628', 'affilname': 'Brazilian Ministry of Environment', 'affiliation-city': 'Brasilia', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Review,"['Álvarez-Romero J.', 'Mills M.', 'Adams V.', 'Gurney G.', 'Pressey R.', 'Weeks R.', 'Ban N.', 'Cheok J.', 'Davies T.', 'Day J.', 'Hamel M.', 'Leslie H.', 'Magris R.', 'Storlie C.']","['55014229200', '36509148300', '35195333800', '36561564600', '7006823219', '35747277500', '8268547200', '57191909106', '52363558000', '7403323469', '36179675600', '7003357768', '36952146100', '36605207200']",Aichi biodiversity targets | Integrated land-sea planning | Marine conservation planning | Marine protected areas | Marine spatial planning | Systematic conservation planning,SSHRC,undefined,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320717311114,1632648

In this study, we develop and assess a one-dimensional lake model and apply it to 32 lakes from a global observatory network. The data set included lakes over broad ranges in latitude, climatic zones, size, residence time, mixing regime and trophic level. Model performance was evaluated using several error assessment metrics, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted for nine parameters that governed the surface heat exchange and mixing efficiency. There was low correlation between input data uncertainty and model performance and predictions of temperature were less sensitive to model parameters than prediction of thermocline depth and Schmidt stability. The study provides guidance to where the general model approach and associated assumptions work, and cases where adjustments to model parameterisations and/or structure are required.",29,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114789', 'afid': '60114789', 'affilname': 'Waikato Regional Council', 'affiliation-city': 'Hamilton', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102148', 'afid': '60102148', 'affilname': 'Istituto di Ricerca sulle Acque, Italy', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterotondo', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60045588', 'afid': '60045588', 'affilname': ""Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement"", 'affiliation-city': 'Gif-sur-Yvette', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033476', 'afid': '60033476', 'affilname': 'Israel Oceanographic &amp; Limnological Research Ltd.', 'affiliation-city': 'Haifa', 'affiliation-country': 'Israel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032543', 'afid': '60032543', 'affilname': 'Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031806', 'afid': '60031806', 'affilname': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029616', 'afid': '60029616', 'affilname': 'Aarhus Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Aarhus', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028717', 'afid': '60028717', 'affilname': 'Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München', 'affiliation-city': 'Munich', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027844', 'afid': '60027844', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Granada', 'affiliation-city': 'Granada', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026651', 'afid': '60026651', 'affilname': 'École des Ponts ParisTech', 'affiliation-city': 'Marne-la-Vallee', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025534', 'afid': '60025534', 'affilname': 'Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Troy', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025525', 'afid': '60025525', 'affilname': 'Universität Konstanz', 'affiliation-city': 'Konstanz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022403', 'afid': '60022403', 'affilname': 'Technion -

Chaoborus spp. (midge larvae) live in the anoxic sediments and hypolimnia of freshwater lakes and reservoirs during the day and migrate to the surface waters at night to feed on plankton. It has recently been proposed that Chaoborus take up methane (CH4) from the sediments in their tracheal gas sacs, use this acquired buoyancy to ascend into the surface waters, and then release the CH4, thereby serving as a CH4 ""pump"" to the atmosphere. We tested this hypothesis using diel surveys and seasonal monitoring, as well as incubations of Chaoborus to measure CH4 transport in their gas sacs at different depths and times in a eutrophic reservoir. We found that Chaoborus transported CH4 from the hypolimnion to the lower epilimnion at dusk, but the overall rate of CH4 transport was minor, and incubations revealed substantial variability in CH4 transport over space and time. We calculated that Chaoborus transport ∼0.1 mmol CH4 m-2 yr-1 to the epilimnion in our study reservoir, a very low proportion (<1%) of total CH4 diffusive flux during the summer stratified period. Our data further indicate that CH4 transport by Chaoborus is sensitive to water column mixing, Chaoborus density, and Chaoborus species identity.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Carey C.', 'McClure R.', 'Doubek J.', 'Lofton M.', 'Ward N.', 'Scott D.']","['24553952400', '57191349198', '36682099100', '57200378270', '57193848608', '7404952639']",,NSF,CNS-1737424,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Recent debate over the scope of the U.S. Clean Water Act underscores the need to develop a robust body of scientific work that defines the connectivity between freshwater systems and people. Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual–empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cobourn K.', 'Carey C.', 'Boyle K.', 'Duffy C.', 'Dugan H.', 'Farrell K.', 'Fitchett L.', 'Hanson P.', 'Hart J.', 'Henson V.', 'Hetherington A.', 'Kemanian A.', 'Rudstam L.', 'Shu L.', 'Soranno P.', 'Sorice M.', 'Stachelek J.', 'Ward N.', 'Weathers K.', 'Weng W.', 'Zhang Y.']","['37119949200', '24553952400', '7004966658', '7102331587', '26534277100', '54988183700', '57201734477', '7202060681', '57193322928', '57202546845', '7005436715', '6508293503', '57203046209', '57202549686', '6603813542', '10440051600', '57197811521', '57193848608', '7003465317', '57202542686', '55810499400']",eutrophication | freshwaters | multi-disciplinary | pollution | water quality,NSF,1517823,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Lakes and reservoirs worldwide are increasingly experiencing depletion of dissolved oxygen (anoxia) in their bottom waters (the hypolimnion) because of climate change and eutrophication, which is altering the dynamics of many freshwater ecological communities. Hypolimnetic anoxia may substantially alter the daily migration and distribution of zooplankton, the dominant grazers of phytoplankton in aquatic food webs. In waterbodies with oxic hypolimnia, zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration (DVM), in which they migrate to the dark hypolimnion during the day to escape fish predation or ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage in the well-lit surface waters (the epilimnion). However, due to the physiologically stressful conditions of anoxic hypolimnia, we hypothesized that zooplankton may be forced to remain in the epilimnion during daylight, trading oxic stress for increased predation risk or UV radiation damage. To examine how anoxia impacts zooplankton vertical migration, distribution, biomass, and community composition over day–night periods, we conducted multiple diel sampling campaigns on reservoirs that spanned oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic hypolimnetic conditions. In addition, we sampled the same reservoirs fortnightly during the daytime to examine the vertical position of zooplankton throughout the summer stratified season. Under anoxic conditions, most zooplankton taxa were predominantly found in the epilimnion during the day and night, did not exhibit DVM, and had lower seasonal biomass than in reservoirs with oxic hypolimnia. Only the phantom midge larva, Chaoborus spp., was consistently anoxia-tolerant. Consequently, our results suggest that hypolimnetic anoxia may alter zooplankton migration, biomass, and behavior, which may in turn exacerbate water quality degradation due to the critical role zooplankton play in freshwater ecosystems.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Doubek J.', 'Campbell K.', 'Doubek K.', 'Hamre K.', 'Lofton M.', 'McClure R.', 'Ward N.', 'Carey C.']","['36682099100', '57203634298', '57203634920', '57035081100', '57200378270', '57191349198', '57193848608', '24553952400']",anoxia | calanoid copepod | Chaoborus | cladoceran | climate change | cyclopoid | eutrophication | global change | hypoxia,NSF,CNS-1737424,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Stoichiometric ratios of resources and consumers have been used to predict nutrient limitation across diverse terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In forested headwater streams, coarse and fine benthic organic matter (CBOM, FBOM) are primary basal resources for the food web, and the distribution and quality of these organic matter resources may therefore influence patterns of secondary production and nutrient cycling within stream networks or among biomes. We measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) content of CBOM and FBOM and calculated their stoichiometric ratios (C/N, C/P, N/P) from first- to fourth-order streams from tropical montane, temperate deciduous, and boreal forests, and tallgrass prairie, to compare the magnitude and variability of these resource types among biomes. We then used the ratios to predict nutritional limitations for consumers of each resource type. Across biomes, CBOM had consistently higher %C and %N, and higher and more variable C/N and C/P than FBOM, suggesting that microbial processing results in more tightly constrained elemental composition in FBOM than in CBOM. Biome-specific differences were observed in %P and N/P between the two resource pools; CBOM was lower in %P but higher in N/P than FBOM in the tropical montane and temperate deciduous forest biomes, while CBOM was higher in %P but similar in N/P than FBOM in the grassland and boreal forest biomes. Stable 13C isotopes suggest that FBOM likely derives from CBOM in tropical and temperate deciduous forest, but that additional non-detrital components may contribute to FBOM in boreal forests and grasslands. Comparisons of stoichiometric ratios of CBOM and FBOM to estimated needs of aquatic detritivores suggest that shredders feeding on CBOM are more likely to experience nutrient (N and/or P) than C limitation, whereas collector–gatherers consuming FBOM are more likely to experience C than N and/or P limitation. Our results suggest that differences in basal resource elemental content and stoichiometric ratios have the potential to affect consumer production and ecosystem rates of C, N, and P cycling in relatively consistent ways across diverse biomes.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029472', 'afid': '60029472', 'affilname': 'Southern Illinois University at Carbondale', 'affiliation-city': 'Carbondale', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028186', 'afid': '60028186', 'affilname': 'Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'affiliation-city': 'Lausanne', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015206', 'afid': '60015206', 'affilname': 'Florida International University', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Farrell K.', 'Rosemond A.', 'Kominoski J.', 'Bonjour S.', 'Rüegg J.', 'Koenig L.', 'Baker C.', 'Trentman M.', 'Harms T.', 'McDowell W.']","['54988183700', '6602097039', '16744899000', '57201358069', '24072180100', '56040935500', '56911624200', '56671327200', '8855144200', '7006465552']",benthic organic matter | elemental ratios | lotic aquatic ecosystem | macroinvertebrate | nitrogen | phosphorus | threshold elemental ratio,NSF,EF-1065255,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Environmental research requires understanding nonlinear ecological dynamics thatinteract across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The analysis of long-term andhigh-frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student trainingprograms in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacy-thatis, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasks-israrely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experiencedeveloping undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysisand simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives,Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) andMacrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R)and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The useof prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increasestudents' experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. Thesetypes of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with thecomputational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses ontheir own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand theavailability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers indata science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science inecology.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Farrell K.', 'Carey C.']","['54988183700', '24553952400']",Active learning | Big Data | Computer programming | Data science | Education | R software | Sensordata | Teaching modules,NSF,CNS 1737424,National Science Foundation,,1517823

In this study, we show that irrigation districts alleviate that risk by deviating from the strict application of prior appropriation doctrine. As a result, farmers inside irrigation districts are able to plant more water-intensive crops than farmers outside irrigation districts, which increases average profitability. We empirically examine this hypothesis by leveraging a georeferenced panel data set at the spatial scale of the individual water right and spanning 2007–14 in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain. Our results indicate that on average, irrigation districts allocate larger portions of their land to drought-sensitive, high-value crops such as sugar beets and potatoes. As a result of differences in planting decisions, members of irrigation districts earn on average $16.20 per acre, or 6.0% more per year than those outside of irrigation districts.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ji X.', 'Cobourn K.']","['57200276628', '37119949200']",,ICTAS,1517823,Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science,,1517823

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Constructed lakes and impoundments (reservoirs) likely exhibit substantial differences in their physics, chemistry, and biology from naturally formed lakes; however, because reservoirs and natural lakes generally have different latitudinal distributions, less is known about quantitative, generalized differences between the 2 waterbody types. We compared a suite of limnological variables among 1033 reservoirs and natural lakes across multiple size classes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States. In general, reservoirs had significantly greater perimeters, catchment areas, and catchment area:surface area ratios than natural lakes. Interestingly, several lakeshore land use, morphometric, and water quality response variables exhibited significant interactions between waterbody type and latitude. Southern reservoirs were deeper and had higher proportions of forested land and less agriculture and developed land use in their lakeshore than southern natural lakes, whereas northern reservoirs were shallower and had less forest and more agriculture and developed land in their lakeshore than northern natural lakes. Following the waterbody depth and land use data, natural lakes also had greater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at lower latitudes, whereas reservoirs had greater TP concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at higher latitudes. Overall, natural lakes were more eutrophic than reservoirs, having greater total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations, regardless of latitude. Our findings indicate that many physical, chemical, and lakeshore land use characteristics of reservoirs and natural lakes vary on a latitudinal gradient, which has implications for the water quality, ecology, and management of these waterbodies.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Doubek J.', 'Carey C.']","['36682099100', '24553952400']",Chlorophyll a | impoundment | land use | latitude | nitrogen | phosphorus | water temperature,ICTAS,DEB-1601061,Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science,,1517823

Metrics describing the shape and size of lakes, known as lake morphometry metrics, are important for any limnological study. In cases where a lake has long been the subject of study these data are often already collected and are openly available. Many other lakes have these data collected, but access is challenging as it is often stored on individual computers (or worse, in filing cabinets) and is available only to the primary investigators. The vast majority of lakes fall into a third category in which the data are not available. This makes broad scale modelling of lake ecology a challenge as some of the key information about in-lake processes are unavailable. While this valuable in situ information may be difficult to obtain, several national datasets exist that may be used to model and estimate lake morphometry. In particular, digital elevation models and hydrography have been shown to be predictive of several lake morphometry metrics. The R package lakemorpho has been developed to utilize these data and estimate the following morphometry metrics: surface area, shoreline length, major axis length, minor axis length, major and minor axis length ratio, shoreline development, maximum depth, mean depth, volume, maximum lake length, mean lake width, maximum lake width, and fetch. In this software tool article we describe the motivation behind developing lakemorpho, discuss the implementation in R, and describe the use of lakemorpho with an example of a typical use case.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hollister J.', 'Stachelek J.']","['7003746590', '57197811521']",Lake depth | Lake morphometry | Lake volume | Limnology | R,,undefined,,,1517823

Computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing, running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing results; however, computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This impliesnew workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals.

Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.",23,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Snortheim C.', 'Hanson P.', 'McMahon K.', 'Read J.', 'Carey C.', 'Dugan H.']","['57191833658', '7202060681', '7006447025', '37023271100', '24553952400', '26534277100']",Anoxia | Anoxic factor | Climate change | Dissolved oxygen | Hydrodynamics | Limnology,CDI,GEO-1517823,Children's Discovery Institute,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S030438001630583X,1517823

Historical ecological surveys serve as a baseline and provide context for contemporary research, yet many of these records are not preserved in a way that ensures their long-term usability. The National Eutrophication Survey (NES) database is currently only available as scans of the original reports (PDF files) with no embedded character information. This limits its searchability, machine readability, and the ability of current and future scientists to systematically evaluate its contents. The NES data were collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency between 1972 and 1975 as part of an effort to investigate eutrophication in freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Although several studies have manually transcribed small portions of the database in support of specific studies, there have been no systematic attempts to transcribe and preserve the database in its entirety. Here we use a combination of automated optical character recognition and manual quality assurance procedures to make these data available for analysis. The performance of the optical character recognition protocol was found to be linked to variation in the quality (clarity) of the original documents. For each of the four archival scanned reports, our quality assurance protocol found an error rate between 5.9 and 17%. The goal of our approach was to strike a balance between efficiency and data quality by combining entry of data by hand with digital transcription technologies. The finished database contains information on the physical characteristics, hydrology, and water quality of about 800 lakes in the contiguous US (Stachelek et al.(2017), https://doi.org/10.5063/F1639MVD). Ultimately, this database could be combined with more recent studies to generate meta-analyses of water quality trends and spatial variation across the continental US.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Stachelek J.', 'Ford C.', 'Kincaid D.', 'King K.', 'Miller H.', 'Nagelkirk R.']","['57197811521', '57200310888', '57211792433', '57200304573', '57200307487', '56427912100']",,,ICER-1517823,National Science Foundation,,1517823

This paper presents GRAPLEr, a distributed computing system used to address the modeling needs of GRAPLE researchers. GRAPLEr integrates and applies overlay virtual network, high-throughput computing, and WEB service technologies in a novel way. First, its user-level IP-over-P2P overlay network allows compute and storage resources distributed across independently administered institutions (including private and public clouds) to be aggregated into a common virtual network, despite the presence of firewalls and network address translators. Second, resources aggregated by the IP-over-P2P virtual network run unmodified high-throughput-computing middleware to enable large numbers of model simulations to be executed concurrently across the distributed computing resources. Third, a WEB service interface allows end users to submit job requests to the system using client libraries that integrate with the R statistical computing environment. The paper presents the GRAPLEr architecture, describes its implementation and reports on its performance for batches of general lake model simulations across 3 cloud infrastructures (University of Florida, CloudLab, and Microsoft Azure).",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Conference Paper,"['Subratie K.', 'Aditya S.', 'Mahesula S.', 'Figueiredo R.', 'Carey C.', 'Hanson P.']","['57194066454', '57194072088', '57194067564', '7006401460', '24553952400', '7202060681']",climate change | distributed computing | general lake model | HTCondor | IPOP-VPN | lake modeling | overlay networks,,undefined,,,1517823

85064260676,2-s2.0-85064260676,Perspective: Advancing the research agenda for improving understanding of cyanobacteria in a future of global change,Harmful Algae,15689883,,18781470,91,,,2020-01-01,10.1016/j.hal.2019.04.004,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (=cyanoHABs) are an increasing feature of many waterbodies throughout the world. Many bloom-forming species produce toxins, making them of particular concern for drinking water supplies, recreation and fisheries in waterbodies along the freshwater to marine continuum. Global changes resulting from human impacts, such as climate change, over-enrichment and hydrological alterations of waterways, are major drivers of cyanoHAB proliferation and persistence. This review advocates that to better predict and manage cyanoHABs in a changing world, researchers need to leverage studies undertaken to date, but adopt a more complex and definitive suite of experiments, observations, and models which can effectively capture the temporal scales of processes driven by eutrophication and a changing climate. Better integration of laboratory culture and field experiments, as well as whole system and multiple-system studies are needed to improve confidence in models predicting impacts of climate change and anthropogenic over-enrichment and hydrological modifications. Recent studies examining adaptation of species and strains to long-term perturbations, e.g. temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, as well as incorporating multi-species and multi-stressor approaches emphasize the limitations of approaches focused on single stressors and individual species. There are also emerging species of concern, such as toxic benthic cyanobacteria, for which the effects of global change are less well understood, and require more detailed study. This review provides approaches and examples of studies tackling the challenging issue of understanding how global changes will affect cyanoHABs, and identifies critical information needs for effective prediction and management.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028596', 'afid': '60028596', 'affilname': 'Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics - Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020376', 'afid': '60020376', 'affilname': 'Cawthron', 'affiliation-city': 'Nelson', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016437', 'afid': '60016437', 'affilname': 'Göteborgs Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Gothenburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010851', 'afid': '60010851', 'affilname': 'Hohai University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Burford M.A.', 'Carey C.C.', 'Hamilton D.P.', 'Huisman J.', 'Paerl H.W.', 'Wood S.A.', 'Wulff A.']","['7006131287', '24553952400', '55921875600', '7102537375', '57213645166', '15766631100', '7004267909']",Climate change | CO 2 | cyanoHABs | Temperature,NSF,CBET 0826819,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1568988319300514,1517823

Changes in the abundance of a taxon can have large effects on communities, particularly if that taxon is a strong interactor. These changes may arise as a consequence of environmental change, recruitment from dormant stages, or quirks of population dynamics, and have effects that ripple through a community interaction network. We hypothesized that cyanobacteria, which are increasing in many freshwater lakes globally, may be strong interactors because they can exert large and persistent effects on the biomass and composition of other phytoplankton. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated how the phytoplankton community responded to different densities of Gloeotrichia echinulata, a large colonial cyanobacterium increasingly observed in low-nutrient lakes in northeastern North America, in an in situ mesocosm experiment. We observed that many phytoplankton taxa, especially diatoms and green algae, responded primarily to increased nutrient availability (a result of Gloeotrichia’s nitrogen fixation and translocation of phosphorus from the sediments), while a few taxa (two euglenophytes, one dinoflagellate, and one cyanobacterium) responded to both the direct and indirect effects of Gloeotrichia. Surprisingly, Gloeotrichia reduced the compositional variability of the phytoplankton community relative to the non-Gloeotrichia control treatment; there was no effect on the aggregate temporal variability of total non-Gloeotrichia biovolume. Moreover, experimentally increased densities of Gloeotrichia coincided with increasing complexity of the phytoplankton community in network analyses of taxon co-occurrences, as indicated by significantly greater network density and transitivity and shorter path lengths. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gloeotrichia may be a strongly interacting species in low-nutrient lakes, with the potential to increase the resilience of phytoplankton communities to future disturbance by increasing compositional stability and network complexity.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010756', 'afid': '60010756', 'affilname': 'Dartmouth College', 'affiliation-city': 'Hanover', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Carey C.', 'Brown B.', 'Cottingham K.']","['24553952400', '35610123100', '57207605233']",Aggregate variability | Bloom | Community structure | Compositional variability | Cyanobacteria | Network analysis | Path analysis | Resilience | Strongly interacting species,NSF,DEB-1010862,National Science Foundation,,1517823

In the era of big data, ecologists are increasingly relying on computational approaches and tools to answer existing questions and pose new research questions. These include both software applications (e.g., simulation models, databases and machine learning algorithms) and hardware systems (e.g., wireless sensor networks, supercomputing, drones and satellites), motivating the need for greater collaboration between computer scientists and ecologists. Here, we outline some synergistic opportunities for scientists in both disciplines that can be gained by building collaborations between the computer science and ecology research communities, with a focus on the benefits to ecology specifically. We also identify past contributions of computer science to ecology, including high-frequency environmental sensor technology, advanced supercomputing capacity for ecological modeling, databases for long-term and high-frequency datasets, and software programs for ecological analyses, to anticipate future potential contributions. These examples highlight the power and potential for further integration of computer science technology and ideas into the ecological research community. Finally, we translate our own experiences working together as a team of computer scientists and ecologists over the past decade into a conceptual framework with recommendations for supporting productive collaborations at the interface of the two disciplines.

Recent debate over the scope of the U.S. Clean Water Act underscores the need to develop a robust body of scientific work that defines the connectivity between freshwater systems and people. Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual–empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cobourn K.', 'Carey C.', 'Boyle K.', 'Duffy C.', 'Dugan H.', 'Farrell K.', 'Fitchett L.', 'Hanson P.', 'Hart J.', 'Henson V.', 'Hetherington A.', 'Kemanian A.', 'Rudstam L.', 'Shu L.', 'Soranno P.', 'Sorice M.', 'Stachelek J.', 'Ward N.', 'Weathers K.', 'Weng W.', 'Zhang Y.']","['37119949200', '24553952400', '7004966658', '7102331587', '26534277100', '54988183700', '57201734477', '7202060681', '57193322928', '57202546845', '7005436715', '6508293503', '57203046209', '57202549686', '6603813542', '10440051600', '57197811521', '57193848608', '7003465317', '57202542686', '55810499400']",eutrophication | freshwaters | multi-disciplinary | pollution | water quality,NSF,1517823,National Science Foundation,,1517823

The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. Inherent differences between naturally-formed lakes and human-made reservoirs may play an important role in shaping zooplankton community structure. For example, because many reservoirs are created by impounding and managing lotic systems for specific human purposes, zooplankton communities may be affected by factors that are unique to reservoirs, such as shorter water residence times and a reservoir’s management regime, compared to natural lakes. However, the environmental factors that structure zooplankton communities in natural lakes vs. reservoirs may vary at the continental scale and remain largely unknown. We analyzed data from the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Lakes Assessment and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams to compare large-bodied crustacean zooplankton communities (defined here as individuals retained by 0.243 mm mesh size) in natural lakes and reservoirs across the continental U.S. using multiple linear regressions and regression tree analyses. We found that large-bodied crustacean zooplankton density was overall higher in natural lakes compared to reservoirs when the effect of latitude was controlled. The difference between waterbody types was driven by calanoid copepods, which were also more likely to be dominant in the >0.243 mm zooplankton community in natural lakes than in reservoirs. Regression tree analyses revealed that water residence time was not a major driver of calanoid copepod density in natural lakes but was one of the most important drivers of calanoid copepod density in reservoirs, which had on average 0.5-year shorter water residence times than natural lakes. Reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in shorter residence times (e.g., hydroelectric power) had lower zooplankton densities than reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in longer residence times (e.g., irrigation). Consequently, our results indicate that water residence time may be an important characteristic driving differing large-bodied zooplankton dynamics between reservoirs and natural lakes.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032706', 'afid': '60032706', 'affilname': 'Miami University', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025525', 'afid': '60025525', 'affilname': 'Universität Konstanz', 'affiliation-city': 'Konstanz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016005', 'afid': '60016005', 'affilname': ""Queen's University, Kingston"", 'affiliation-city': 'Kingston', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011832', 'afid': '60011832', 'affilname': 'Université de Sherbrooke', 'affiliation-city': 'Sherbrooke', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009500', 'afid': '60009500', 'affilname': 'University of Vermont', 'affiliation-city': 'Burlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Doubek J.', 'Carey C.', 'Lavender M.', 'Winegardner A.', 'Beaulieu M.', 'Kelly P.', 'Pollard A.', 'Straile D.', 'Stockwell J.']","['36682099100', '24553952400', '57205374714', '54952428000', '56088237200', '56241083000', '8564645000', '6602588942', '7003712059']",,NSF,DEB-1601061,National Science Foundation,,1517823

In freshwater lakes and reservoirs, climate change and eutrophication are increasing the occurrence of low-dissolved oxygen concentrations (hypoxia), which has the potential to alter the variability of zooplankton seasonal dynamics. We sampled zooplankton and physical, chemical and biological variables (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a) in four reservoirs during the summer stratified period for three consecutive years. The hypolimnion (bottom waters) of two reservoirs remained oxic throughout the entire stratified period, whereas the hypolimnion of the other two reservoirs became hypoxic during the stratified period. Biomass variability (measured as the coefficient of the variation of zooplankton biomass) and compositional variability (measured as the community composition of zooplankton) of crustacean zooplankton communities were similar throughout the summer in the oxic reservoirs; however, biomass variability and compositional variability significantly increased after the onset of hypoxia in the two seasonally-hypoxic reservoirs. The increase in biomass variability in the seasonally-hypoxic reservoirs was driven largely by an increase in the variability of copepod biomass, while the increase in compositional variability was driven by increased variability in the dominance (proportion of total crustacean zooplankton biomass) of copepod taxa.

Stoichiometric ratios of resources and consumers have been used to predict nutrient limitation across diverse terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In forested headwater streams, coarse and fine benthic organic matter (CBOM, FBOM) are primary basal resources for the food web, and the distribution and quality of these organic matter resources may therefore influence patterns of secondary production and nutrient cycling within stream networks or among biomes. We measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) content of CBOM and FBOM and calculated their stoichiometric ratios (C/N, C/P, N/P) from first- to fourth-order streams from tropical montane, temperate deciduous, and boreal forests, and tallgrass prairie, to compare the magnitude and variability of these resource types among biomes. We then used the ratios to predict nutritional limitations for consumers of each resource type. Across biomes, CBOM had consistently higher %C and %N, and higher and more variable C/N and C/P than FBOM, suggesting that microbial processing results in more tightly constrained elemental composition in FBOM than in CBOM. Biome-specific differences were observed in %P and N/P between the two resource pools; CBOM was lower in %P but higher in N/P than FBOM in the tropical montane and temperate deciduous forest biomes, while CBOM was higher in %P but similar in N/P than FBOM in the grassland and boreal forest biomes. Stable 13C isotopes suggest that FBOM likely derives from CBOM in tropical and temperate deciduous forest, but that additional non-detrital components may contribute to FBOM in boreal forests and grasslands. Comparisons of stoichiometric ratios of CBOM and FBOM to estimated needs of aquatic detritivores suggest that shredders feeding on CBOM are more likely to experience nutrient (N and/or P) than C limitation, whereas collector–gatherers consuming FBOM are more likely to experience C than N and/or P limitation. Our results suggest that differences in basal resource elemental content and stoichiometric ratios have the potential to affect consumer production and ecosystem rates of C, N, and P cycling in relatively consistent ways across diverse biomes.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029472', 'afid': '60029472', 'affilname': 'Southern Illinois University at Carbondale', 'affiliation-city': 'Carbondale', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028186', 'afid': '60028186', 'affilname': 'Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne', 'affiliation-city': 'Lausanne', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015206', 'afid': '60015206', 'affilname': 'Florida International University', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Farrell K.', 'Rosemond A.', 'Kominoski J.', 'Bonjour S.', 'Rüegg J.', 'Koenig L.', 'Baker C.', 'Trentman M.', 'Harms T.', 'McDowell W.']","['54988183700', '6602097039', '16744899000', '57201358069', '24072180100', '56040935500', '56911624200', '56671327200', '8855144200', '7006465552']",benthic organic matter | elemental ratios | lotic aquatic ecosystem | macroinvertebrate | nitrogen | phosphorus | threshold elemental ratio,NSF,EF-1065255,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Through our experiencedeveloping undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysisand simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives,Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) andMacrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R)and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The useof prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increasestudents' experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. Thesetypes of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with thecomputational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses ontheir own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand theavailability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers indata science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science inecology.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Farrell K.', 'Carey C.']","['54988183700', '24553952400']",Active learning | Big Data | Computer programming | Data science | Education | R software | Sensordata | Teaching modules,NSF,CNS 1737424,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Metrics describing the shape and size of lakes, known as lake morphometry metrics, are important for any limnological study. In cases where a lake has long been the subject of study these data are often already collected and are openly available. Many other lakes have these data collected, but access is challenging as it is often stored on individual computers (or worse, in filing cabinets) and is available only to the primary investigators. The vast majority of lakes fall into a third category in which the data are not available. This makes broad scale modelling of lake ecology a challenge as some of the key information about in-lake processes are unavailable. While this valuable in situ information may be difficult to obtain, several national datasets exist that may be used to model and estimate lake morphometry. In particular, digital elevation models and hydrography have been shown to be predictive of several lake morphometry metrics. The R package lakemorpho has been developed to utilize these data and estimate the following morphometry metrics: surface area, shoreline length, major axis length, minor axis length, major and minor axis length ratio, shoreline development, maximum depth, mean depth, volume, maximum lake length, mean lake width, maximum lake width, and fetch. In this software tool article we describe the motivation behind developing lakemorpho, discuss the implementation in R, and describe the use of lakemorpho with an example of a typical use case.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hollister J.', 'Stachelek J.']","['7003746590', '57197811521']",Lake depth | Lake morphometry | Lake volume | Limnology | R,,undefined,,,1517823

In this study, we show that irrigation districts alleviate that risk by deviating from the strict application of prior appropriation doctrine. As a result, farmers inside irrigation districts are able to plant more water-intensive crops than farmers outside irrigation districts, which increases average profitability. We empirically examine this hypothesis by leveraging a georeferenced panel data set at the spatial scale of the individual water right and spanning 2007–14 in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain. Our results indicate that on average, irrigation districts allocate larger portions of their land to drought-sensitive, high-value crops such as sugar beets and potatoes. As a result of differences in planting decisions, members of irrigation districts earn on average $16.20 per acre, or 6.0% more per year than those outside of irrigation districts.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ji X.', 'Cobourn K.']","['57200276628', '37119949200']",,ICTAS,1517823,Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science,,1517823

Metalimnetic oxygen minimum zones (MOMs) commonly develop during the summer stratified period in freshwater reservoirs because of both natural processes and water quality management. While several previous studies have examined the causes of MOMs, much less is known about their effects, especially on reservoir biogeochemistry. MOMs create distinct redox gradients in the water column which may alter the magnitude and vertical distribution of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The vertical distribution and diffusive efflux of CH4 and CO2 was monitored for two consecutive open-water seasons in a eutrophic reservoir that develops MOMs as a result of the operation of water quality engineering systems. During both summers, elevated concentrations of CH4 accumulated within the anoxic MOM, reaching a maximum of 120 μM, and elevated concentrations of CO2 accumulated in the oxic hypolimnion, reaching a maximum of 780 μM. Interestingly, the largest observed diffusive CH4 effluxes occurred before fall turnover in both years, while peak diffusive CO2 effluxes occurred both before and during turnover. Our data indicate that MOMs can substantially change the vertical distribution of CH4 and CO2 in the water column in reservoirs, resulting in the accumulation of CH4 in the metalimnion (vs. at the sediments) and CO2 in the hypolimnion.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025709', 'afid': '60025709', 'affilname': 'The University of Sydney', 'affiliation-city': 'Sydney', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['McClure R.', 'Hamre K.', 'Niederlehner B.', 'Munger Z.', 'Chen S.', 'Lofton M.', 'Schreiber M.', 'Carey C.']","['57191349198', '57035081100', '6701839733', '57035442000', '56065954100', '57200378270', '7201540695', '24553952400']",Diffusive emissions | Greenhouse gases | Oxygen minimum zone | Redox gradient | Reservoirs | Water quality management,NSF,DEB-1753639,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969718314323,1517823

The Authors. Aquatic systems are critical to food, security, and society. But, water data are collected by hundreds of research groups and organizations, many of which use nonstandard or inconsistent data descriptions and dissemination, and disparities across different types of water observation systems represent a major challenge for freshwater research. To address this issue, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to be a single point of access for water quality data dating back more than a century. The WQP is the largest standardized water quality data set available at the time of this writing, with more than 290 million records from more than 2.7 million sites in groundwater, inland, and coastal waters. The number of data contributors, data consumers, and third-party application developers making use of the WQP is growing rapidly. Here we introduce the WQP, including an overview of data, the standardized data model, and data access and services; and we describe challenges and opportunities associated with using WQP data. We also demonstrate through an example the value of the WQP data by characterizing seasonal variation in lake water clarity for regions of the continental U.S. The code used to access, download, analyze, and display these WQP data as shown in the figures is included as supporting information.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Read E.', 'Carr L.', 'De Cicco L.', 'Dugan H.', 'Hanson P.', 'Hart J.', 'Kreft J.', 'Read J.', 'Winslow L.']","['55879293600', '57193324557', '56444111700', '26534277100', '7202060681', '57193322928', '57188632938', '37023271100', '24777603300']",hydrography | limnology | open data | open source software | Water Quality Portal | web services,,undefined,,,1517823

Computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing, running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing results; however, computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This impliesnew workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals.

However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.",23,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Snortheim C.', 'Hanson P.', 'McMahon K.', 'Read J.', 'Carey C.', 'Dugan H.']","['57191833658', '7202060681', '7006447025', '37023271100', '24553952400', '26534277100']",Anoxia | Anoxic factor | Climate change | Dissolved oxygen | Hydrodynamics | Limnology,CDI,GEO-1517823,Children's Discovery Institute,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S030438001630583X,1517823

However, there is substantial variation in P retention among lakes with the same depth and residence time. One potential explanatory factor for this variation is differences in freshwater connectivity of lakes (i.e., the type and amount of freshwater connections to a lake), which can influence watershed P trapping or the particulate load fraction of P delivered to lakes via stream connections. To examine the relationship between P retention and connectivity, we quantified several different measures of connectivity including those that reflect downstream transport of material (sediment, water, and nutrients) within lake-stream networks (lake-stream-based metrics) as well as those that reflect transport of material from hillslope and riparian areas adjacent to watershed stream networks (stream-based metrics). Because it is not always clear what spatial extent is appropriate for determining functional differences in connectivity among lakes, we compared connectivity metrics at two important spatial extents: the lake subwatershed extent and the lake watershed extent. We found that variation in P retention among lakes was more strongly associated with connectivity metrics measured at the broader lake watershed extent rather than metrics measured at the finer lake subwatershed extent. Our results suggest that both connectivity between lakes and streams as well as connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds influence P retention.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Stachelek J.', 'Soranno P.']","['57197811521', '6603813542']",,NIFA,1517823,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1517823

Here we use a combination of automated optical character recognition and manual quality assurance procedures to make these data available for analysis. The performance of the optical character recognition protocol was found to be linked to variation in the quality (clarity) of the original documents. For each of the four archival scanned reports, our quality assurance protocol found an error rate between 5.9 and 17%.

The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. Inherent differences between naturally-formed lakes and human-made reservoirs may play an important role in shaping zooplankton community structure. For example, because many reservoirs are created by impounding and managing lotic systems for specific human purposes, zooplankton communities may be affected by factors that are unique to reservoirs, such as shorter water residence times and a reservoir’s management regime, compared to natural lakes. However, the environmental factors that structure zooplankton communities in natural lakes vs. reservoirs may vary at the continental scale and remain largely unknown. We analyzed data from the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Lakes Assessment and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams to compare large-bodied crustacean zooplankton communities (defined here as individuals retained by 0.243 mm mesh size) in natural lakes and reservoirs across the continental U.S. using multiple linear regressions and regression tree analyses. We found that large-bodied crustacean zooplankton density was overall higher in natural lakes compared to reservoirs when the effect of latitude was controlled. The difference between waterbody types was driven by calanoid copepods, which were also more likely to be dominant in the >0.243 mm zooplankton community in natural lakes than in reservoirs. Regression tree analyses revealed that water residence time was not a major driver of calanoid copepod density in natural lakes but was one of the most important drivers of calanoid copepod density in reservoirs, which had on average 0.5-year shorter water residence times than natural lakes. Reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in shorter residence times (e.g., hydroelectric power) had lower zooplankton densities than reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in longer residence times (e.g., irrigation). Consequently, our results indicate that water residence time may be an important characteristic driving differing large-bodied zooplankton dynamics between reservoirs and natural lakes.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032706', 'afid': '60032706', 'affilname': 'Miami University', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025525', 'afid': '60025525', 'affilname': 'Universität Konstanz', 'affiliation-city': 'Konstanz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016005', 'afid': '60016005', 'affilname': ""Queen's University, Kingston"", 'affiliation-city': 'Kingston', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011832', 'afid': '60011832', 'affilname': 'Université de Sherbrooke', 'affiliation-city': 'Sherbrooke', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009500', 'afid': '60009500', 'affilname': 'University of Vermont', 'affiliation-city': 'Burlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Doubek J.', 'Carey C.', 'Lavender M.', 'Winegardner A.', 'Beaulieu M.', 'Kelly P.', 'Pollard A.', 'Straile D.', 'Stockwell J.']","['36682099100', '24553952400', '57205374714', '54952428000', '56088237200', '56241083000', '8564645000', '6602588942', '7003712059']",,NSF,DEB-1601061,National Science Foundation,,1517823

Cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in waterbodies worldwide because of anthropogenic forcing. Most blooms occur at the water’s surface, but some cyanobacterial taxa, such as Planktothrix, are able to modify their buoyancy to access more favorable growing conditions in deeper waters. Here, we used in situ fluorometry to examine the vertical distribution and biomass of Planktothrix in a seasonally anoxic reservoir for 3 consecutive summers. We also collected depth profiles of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and nutrients to evaluate which environmental drivers were most important for predicting Planktothrix biomass. In all 3 summers, Planktothrix dominated the phytoplankton community, exhibiting a large (concentrations ~100 lg/L), persistent (lasting ~100 d) bloom below the thermocline. The bloom consistently exhibited maximum biomass at or below the depth reached by 1% of surface light. Light availability probably was the most important factor driving the vertical distribution of the stratified Planktothrix bloom, and light, temperature, and nutrients together were strong predictors of cyanobacterial biomass in the hypolimnion, explaining 71 to 93% of the variation in biomass. Our data suggest that Planktothrix remained in the hypolimnion where nutrient availability was maximized, while progressing slightly upward in the water column through each summer in response to light limitation. Our findings demonstrate that Planktothrix can dominate in low light and anoxic conditions and can form persistent blooms that last for multiple months. As cyanobacterial blooms become more prevalent, monitoring cyanobacteria at the surface and at depth will become critically important in freshwater ecosystems.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hamre K.', 'Lofton M.', 'McClure R.', 'Munger Z.', 'Doubek J.', 'Gerling A.', 'Schreiber M.', 'Carey C.']","['57035081100', '57200378270', '57191349198', '57035442000', '36682099100', '56374639500', '7201540695', '24553952400']",Cyanobacteria | FluoroProbe | Light limitation | Nutrients | Planktothrix agardhii | Stratification | Turbidity,NSF,CNS-1737424,National Science Foundation,,1517823

In freshwater lakes and reservoirs, climate change and eutrophication are increasing the occurrence of low-dissolved oxygen concentrations (hypoxia), which has the potential to alter the variability of zooplankton seasonal dynamics. We sampled zooplankton and physical, chemical and biological variables (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a) in four reservoirs during the summer stratified period for three consecutive years. The hypolimnion (bottom waters) of two reservoirs remained oxic throughout the entire stratified period, whereas the hypolimnion of the other two reservoirs became hypoxic during the stratified period. Biomass variability (measured as the coefficient of the variation of zooplankton biomass) and compositional variability (measured as the community composition of zooplankton) of crustacean zooplankton communities were similar throughout the summer in the oxic reservoirs; however, biomass variability and compositional variability significantly increased after the onset of hypoxia in the two seasonally-hypoxic reservoirs. The increase in biomass variability in the seasonally-hypoxic reservoirs was driven largely by an increase in the variability of copepod biomass, while the increase in compositional variability was driven by increased variability in the dominance (proportion of total crustacean zooplankton biomass) of copepod taxa.

Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd on behalf of Zoological Society of London. In the central South Arabian mountains of Yemen and Oman, monsoon fog interception by the endemic cloud forest is essential for ecosystem functions and services. Yet, we know little about the local factors affecting fog distributions and their cumulative effects on vegetation. To examine these relationships, we developed a novel method of high-resolution fog detection using Landsat data, and validated the results using occurrence records of eight moisture-sensitive plant species. Regression tree analysis was then used to examine the topographic factors influencing fog distributions and the topoclimatic factors influencing satellite-derived vegetation greenness. We find that the interplay between the complex mountain topography and the incoming fog results in heterogeneous fog densities. Specifically, fog accumulates against steep windward slopes and landforms, resulting in hotspots of fog interception, while lower fog densities occur in leeward locations. We also find that fog distributions correlate with patterns of vegetation greenness, and overall, that greenness increases with fog density. The layer of fog density describes patterns of vegetation greenness more accurately than topographic variables alone, and thus, we propose that regional vegetation patterns more closely follow a fog gradient, than an altitudinal gradient as previously supposed. The layer of fog density will enable an improved understanding of how species and communities, many of which are endemic, range-restricted and in decline, respond to local variability in topoclimatic conditions.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010818', 'afid': '60010818', 'affilname': 'University of Kent', 'affiliation-city': 'Canterbury', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500', 'afid': '60003500', 'affilname': 'The Ohio State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ball L.', 'Tzanopoulos J.']","['57215723107', '8925236600']",Anogeissus dhofarica | central South Arabian mountains (CSAM) | cloud forest | Dhofar Oman | fog | khareef | Mahra Yemen | monsoon | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) | regression tree analysis (RTA) | topography | vegetation,,undefined,,,1617185

However, livestock impacts on the vegetation have not been assessed. Furthermore, we have a limited understanding of the impacts of large-bodied browsing livestock, such as camels, in woodland and forest rangelands. Therefore, in this study, we examine the effects of livestock browsing on the species composition, density, and phytomorphology of woody vegetation in the Anogeissus cloud forests in the Dhofar Mountains of Oman. Location: Data were collected at 30 sites in the Jabal Qamar mountain range in western Dhofar, Oman. Methods: The point-centred quarter method was used to sample the composition, density and structure of woody vegetation. Constrained correspondence analysis was used to quantify the effects of livestock browsing on woody plant species composition, whilst effects on plant density were analysed using mixed-effects models. Standardised major axis regression was used to examine differences in height–diameter allometry (stunting) under different stocking rates. Results: Fog density, topographic position and long-term stocking rates were found to be important factors affecting woody species composition. We found lower species diversity and plant density, and higher frequencies of unpalatable species, under higher stocking rates. Juveniles showed a stronger response to stocking rates than adults, and several common species exhibited stunted morphology under high stocking rates. Conclusions: Browsing by large-bodied livestock, such as camels and cattle, can substantially alter the species composition, structure, and phytomorphology of woody vegetation in semi-arid woodlands and forests.

Solar radiation management is increasingly considered to be an option for managing global temperatures1,2, yet the economic effects of ameliorating climatic changes by scattering sunlight back to space remain largely unknown3. Although solar radiation management may increase crop yields by reducing heat stress4, the effects of concomitant changes in available sunlight have never been empirically estimated. Here we use the volcanic eruptions that inspired modern solar radiation management proposals as natural experiments to provide the first estimates, to our knowledge, of how the stratospheric sulfate aerosols created by the eruptions of El Chichón and Mount Pinatubo altered the quantity and quality of global sunlight, and how these changes in sunlight affected global crop yields. We find that the sunlight-mediated effect of stratospheric sulfate aerosols on yields is negative for both C4 (maize) and C3 (soy, rice and wheat) crops. Applying our yield model to a solar radiation management scenario based on stratospheric sulfate aerosols, we find that projected mid-twenty-first century damages due to scattering sunlight caused by solar radiation management are roughly equal in magnitude to benefits from cooling. This suggests that solar radiation management—if deployed using stratospheric sulfate aerosols similar to those emitted by the volcanic eruptions it seeks to mimic—would, on net, attenuate little of the global agricultural damage from climate change. Our approach could be extended to study the effects of solar radiation management on other global systems, such as human health or ecosystem function.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121512', 'afid': '60121512', 'affilname': 'School of Global Policy and Strategy', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121413', 'afid': '60121413', 'affilname': 'The Goldman School of Public Policy', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030162', 'afid': '60030162', 'affilname': 'Columbia University in the City of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020337', 'afid': '60020337', 'affilname': 'National Bureau of Economic Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Proctor J.', 'Hsiang S.', 'Burney J.', 'Burke M.', 'Schlenker W.']","['57203530666', '57190433842', '57205908373', '9744099300', '12242918400']",,NSF,CNH-L 1715557,National Science Foundation,,1715557

The distribution of anthropogenic aerosols’ climate effects depends on the geographic distribution of the aerosols themselves. Yet many scientific and policy discussions ignore the role of emission location when evaluating aerosols’ climate impacts. Here, we present new climate model results demonstrating divergent climate responses to a fixed amount and composition of aerosol—emulating China’s present-day emissions—emitted from 8 key geopolitical regions. The aerosols’ global-mean cooling effect is fourteen times greater when emitted from the highest impact emitting region (Western Europe) than from the lowest (India). Further, radiative forcing, a widely used climate response proxy, fails as an effective predictor of global-mean cooling for national-scale aerosol emissions in our simulations; global-mean forcing-to-cooling efficacy differs fivefold depending on emitting region. This suggests that climate accounting should differentiate between aerosols emitted from different countries and that aerosol emissions’ evolving geographic distribution will impact the global-scale magnitude and spatial distribution of climate change.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024613', 'afid': '60024613', 'affilname': 'Carnegie Institution of Washington', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Persad G.', 'Caldeira K.']","['36244335600', '7004807312']",,NSF,NSF CNH-L 1715557,National Science Foundation,,1715557

Poor air quality is thought to be an important mortality risk factor globally 1-3, but there is little direct evidence from the developing world on how mortality risk varies with changing exposure to ambient particulate matter. Current global estimates apply exposure-response relationships that have been derived mostly from wealthy, mid-latitude countries to spatial population data 4, and these estimates remain unvalidated across large portions of the globe. Here we combine household survey-based information on the location and timing of nearly 1 million births across sub-Saharan Africa with satellite-based estimates 5 of exposure to ambient respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) to estimate the impact of air quality on mortality rates among infants in Africa. We find that a 10 μg m-3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 9% (95% confidence interval, 4-14%) rise in infant mortality across the dataset. This effect has not declined over the last 15 years and does not diminish with higher levels of household wealth. Our estimates suggest that PM2.5 concentrations above minimum exposure levels were responsible for 22% (95% confidence interval, 9-35%) of infant deaths in our 30 study countries and led to 449,000 (95% confidence interval, 194,000-709,000) additional deaths of infants in 2015, an estimate that is more than three times higher than existing estimates that attribute death of infants to poor air quality for these countries 2,6 . Upward revision of disease-burden estimates in the studied countries in Africa alone would result in a doubling of current estimates of global deaths of infants that are associated with air pollution, and modest reductions in African PM2.5 exposures are predicted to have health benefits to infants that are larger than most known health interventions.",47,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121512', 'afid': '60121512', 'affilname': 'School of Global Policy and Strategy', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032838', 'afid': '60032838', 'affilname': 'Stanford University School of Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'Stanford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020337', 'afid': '60020337', 'affilname': 'National Bureau of Economic Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Heft-Neal S.', 'Burney J.', 'Bendavid E.', 'Burke M.']","['57191751808', '57205908373', '16232448800', '9744099300']",,NSF,1715557,National Science Foundation,,1715557

Context: With underrepresentation of habitats in publicly protected areas, attention has focused on the function of alternative land conservation mechanisms. Private conservation easements (CEs) have proliferated in the United States, yet assessing landscape-level function is confounded by varying extent, resolution, and temporal scale. Objectives: We developed and tested an assessment tool to evaluate interacting spatial, social, and environmental attributes of easements relative to the degree of human modification (HM). We hypothesized that on both private and public conservation properties HM would be lower than on non-conserved parcels, and that for fine-scale features (most CEs), the level of HM would be driven by the variables used to create the coarser scale HM measure. Methods: Variation in HM between private, public, and non-conserved was tested via pairwise parcel sampling. Composition was evaluated using multiple geographic bounds and edge characteristics. We assessed both environmental and social predictors using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Privately conserved lands did not differ significantly from non-conserved lands. Publicly conserved lands had lower HM than both privately conserved and non-conserved lands. Edge contrast was similar between private and matched non-conserved patches. The level of HM was not driven by distance to roads, or by elevation in this mixed-use setting. Conclusions: Variation in tests for differences, land characteristics, and HM variables confirmed the significantly lower HM of publicly protected lands, and opens the question as to naturalness of easements in some contexts. CEs in this location may be representative of the mixed rural-forested landscape instead of more natural land cover.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026610', 'afid': '60026610', 'affilname': 'Clemson University', 'affiliation-city': 'Clemson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114230795', 'afid': '114230795', 'affilname': 'Conservation Science Partners', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fouch N.', 'Baldwin R.F.', 'Gerard P.', 'Dyckman C.', 'Theobald D.M.']","['57193885813', '57211726772', '34770245200', '9269234800', '7003695168']",Conservation easement | Human modification | Land-use change | Private land conservation | Protected-area planning,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518455

Throughout a single day, the microclimatic conditions in tropical montane cloud forests vary from strong solar radiation with simultaneous strong atmospheric water demand (high vapor pressure deficit, VPD, values), followed quickly by clouds and fog events drastically reducing both of these environmental variables. Due to the complex topography and weather patterns in these regions, microclimate, including fog events, can vary strongly across very small spatial scales as well, leading to a highly dynamic and compelling environment to examine how environmental variables influence tree water use across space and time. Due to this variation, the present study examines how environmental drivers of tree water use varies across three slope positions (upslope, midslope, low-slope) in a tropical montane cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico. Measurements of sap flow using the heat ratio method were conducted on three dominant canopy species along with simultaneous measurements of microclimate within each site. To assess the relative importance of microclimatic variables in explaining tree water use across diurnal periods, data were separated into day and night periods and fog and clear events. Multiple regression models were conducted for each tree with input variables of VPD, solar radiation, air temperature, shallow soil moisture, deep soil moisture, and leaf wetness. We found that VPD explained a large majority of the variation in tree water use during daytime fog periods, particularly at the upslope and midslope sites. During nighttime periods, VPD was the dominant driver of water use variation during clear periods while a combination of VPD and leaf wetness explained variation during night, fog periods. Additionally, tree water use was more decoupled from environmental variables at the low-slope site. Finally, a separation of model components into fog and clear periods improved model outputs particularly at low flow conditions, highlighting the differential interactions between tree water use and environment during night and fog periods. Results from this study provide new insight into the importance of fog events, low VPD, and leaf surface wetting at controlling tree water use in cloud forests. The variation in drivers of water use across short spatial scales demonstrate the importance of considering individual and species level variation across fog and clear periods in predicting physiological responses of species to climate in cloud forests.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005085', 'afid': '60005085', 'affilname': 'Marshall University', 'affiliation-city': 'Huntingdon', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Berry Z.', 'Gotsch S.', 'Holwerda F.', 'Muñoz-Villers L.', 'Asbjornsen H.']","['16028133700', '26635271700', '6506644040', '23091448100', '8782763500']",Linear modeling | Mexico | Sap flow | Tropical montane cloud forest | Vapor pressure deficit,NSF,NSF/DEB0746179,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168192316301678,1313804

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. In stands with a broad range of diameters, a small number of very large trees can disproportionately influence stand basal area and transpiration (E t). Sap flow-based E t estimates may be particularly sensitive to large trees due to nonlinear relationships between tree-level water use (Q) and tree diameter at breast height (DBH). Because Q is typically predicted on the basis of DBH and sap flow rates measured in a subset of trees and then summed to obtain E t, we assessed the relative importance of DBH and sap flow variables (sap velocity, V s, and sapwood depth, R s) in determining the magnitude of E t and its dependence on large trees in a tropical montane forest ecosystem. Specifically, we developed a data-driven simulation framework to vary the relationship between DBH and V s and stand DBH distribution and then calculate Q, E t and the proportion of E t contributed by the largest tree in each stand. Our results demonstrate that variation in how R s is determined in the largest trees can alter estimates up to 26% of E t while variation in how V s is determined can vary results by up to 132%. Taken together, these results highlight a great need to expand our understanding of water transport in large trees as this hinders our ability to predict water fluxes accurately from stand to catchment scales.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024712', 'afid': '60024712', 'affilname': 'Instituto de Ecología, A.C.', 'affiliation-city': 'Xalapa', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Berry Z.', 'Looker N.', 'Holwerda F.', 'Gómez Aguilar L.', 'Ortiz Colin P.', 'González Martínez T.', 'Asbjornsen H.']","['16028133700', '57188747364', '6506644040', '57200916229', '57193725737', '54890344200', '8782763500']",sap flow | scaling | stand transpiration | tropical montane forests,CONACYT,"187,646",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a,,1313804

Payment for hydrological services (PHS) are popular tools for conserving ecosystems and their water-related services. However, improving the spatial targeting and impacts of PHS, as well as their ability to foster synergies with other ecosystem services (ES), remain challenging. We aimed at using spatial analyses to evaluate the targeting performance of Mexico's National PHS program in central Veracruz. We quantified the effectiveness of areas targeted for PHS in actually covering areas of high HS provision and social priority during 2003-2013. First, we quantified provisioning and spatial distributions of two target (water yield and soil retention), and one non-target ES (carbon storage) using InVEST. Subsequently, pairwise relationships among ES were quantified by using spatial correlation and overlap analyses. Finally, we evaluated targeting by: (i) prioritizing areas of individual and overlapping ES; (ii) quantifying spatial co-occurrences of these priority areas with those targeted by PHS; (iii) evaluating the extent to which PHS directly contribute to HS delivery; and (iv), testing if PHS targeted areas disproportionately covered areas with high ecological and social priority. We found that modelled priority areas exhibited non-random distributions and distinct spatial patterns. Our results show significant pairwise correlations between all ES suggesting synergistic relationships. However, our analysis showed a significantly lower overlap than expected and thus significant mismatches between PHS targeted areas and all types of priority areas. These findings suggest that the targeting of areas with high HS provisioning and social priority by Mexico's PHS program could be improved significantly. This study underscores: (1) the importance of using maps of HS provisioning as main targeting criteria in PHS design to channel payments towards areas that require future conservation, and (2) the need for future research that helps balance ecological and socioeconomic targeting criteria.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024712', 'afid': '60024712', 'affilname': 'Instituto de Ecología, A.C.', 'affiliation-city': 'Xalapa', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009500', 'afid': '60009500', 'affilname': 'University of Vermont', 'affiliation-city': 'Burlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mokondoko P.', 'Manson R.', 'Ricketts T.', 'Geissert D.']","['56239417400', '7003968733', '7102538614', '6602500372']",,,undefined,,,1313804

These coastal fisheries have historically been described as homogeneous in gear-use and fish community makeup. Yet, regional and local variability in the characteristics of these fishing communities was recently identified with community-based fisheries-dependent data. We proposed a flexible modeling approach that incorporated local monitoring data with spatial data to predict the spatial characteristics of the marine fisheries in Tanzania. The spatial models identified relationships between fishery landings and coral reef, seagrass, and mangrove habitat patch attributes, along with fisher density and a hydrologic index. Furthermore, the predicted spatial characteristics matched previously reported fishery characteristics in both districts. The maps developed by our modeling process provide a means for stakeholders and managers to understand the spatial distribution of their fisheries and in turn, focus on explicitly managing what, how, and where fishers operate. Overall, the flexible modeling approach developed here may act as a first step in incorporating local monitoring data into co-management frameworks, which may promote more sustainable fisheries management strategies in data-poor regions.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019000', 'afid': '60019000', 'affilname': 'Memorial University of Newfoundland', 'affiliation-city': ""St John's"", 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Robertson M.D.', 'Midway S.R.']","['57202846960', '35743841500']",Co-management | Data-poor | Developing countries | Small-scale fishery (SSF) | Spatial model,NSF,1518471,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0301479719307029,1518471

Iconic ecosystems like the Florida Coastal Everglades can serve as sentinels of environmental change from local to global scales. This characteristic can help inform general theory about how and why ecosystems transform, particularly if distinctive ecosystem properties are studied over long time scales and compared to those of similar ecosystems elsewhere. Here we review the ways in which long-term, comparative, international research has provided perspectives on iconic features of the Everglades that have, in turn, informed general ecosystem paradigms. Studies in other comparable wetlands from the Caribbean to Australia have shed light on distinctive and puzzling aspects such as the ""upside-down estuary"" and ""productivity paradox"" for which the Everglades is known. These studies suggest that coastal wetlands on carbonate (karstic) platforms have: (1) hydrological and biogeochemical properties that reflect ""hidden"" groundwater sources of water and nutrients, (2) very productive, mat-forming algal communities that present a low-quality food to aquatic consumers that encourages (3) highly diversified feeding strategies within and among populations, and (4) extensive and productive seagrass meadows and mangrove forests that promote strong cultural dependencies associated with the ecosystem services they provide. The contribution of international research to each of these general ecological topics is discussed with a particular goal of encouraging informed decision-making in threatened wetlands across the globe.

In coastal Tanzania, overfishing is likely occurring and thumbprint emperor are commonly represented in catches. The goal of this study was to estimate age and growth to provide basic life history information that may help inform future management. We sampled a total of n = 55 thumbprint emperors from both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Annular age estimates were improved with measurements of otolith markings. Fish ages ranged from zero to five years. We also evaluated the addition of otolith edge size (a proxy for fractional age) to age estimation, and fit two von Bertalanffy growth models—one for the whole ages and one for the fractional ages—using a flexible Bayesian framework. Growth parameters were similar between the two models, and ultimately, L∞ (maximum asymptotic size parameter) estimates were comparable to other published values for the species, although our estimates of K (growth coefficient parameter) were smaller. Robust aging techniques for tropical fishes can provide a foundation for basic fishery management, which would help to sustain the future of this widely distributed fish.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027716', 'afid': '60027716', 'affilname': 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/102070133', 'afid': '102070133', 'affilname': 'Sea Sense', 'affiliation-city': 'Dar Es Salaam', 'affiliation-country': 'Tanzania'}]",Journal,Article,"['Midway S.', 'Ostrowski A.', 'West L.', 'Hernandez M.', 'Robertson M.']","['35743841500', '57208488025', '57202948396', '57202856828', '57202846960']",Artisanal | Growth | Lethrinidae | Otolith,,1518471,,,1518471

Context: Resilience is a concept central to the field of ecology, but our understanding of resilience is not sufficient to predict when and where large changes in species composition might occur following disturbances, particularly under climate change. Objectives: Our objective was to estimate how wind disturbance shapes landscape-level patterns of engineering resilience, defined as the recovery of total biomass and species composition after a windstorm, under climate change in central Wisconsin. Methods: We used a spatially-explicit, forest simulation model (LANDIS-II) to simulate how windstorms and climate change affect forest succession and used boosted regression tree analysis to isolate the important drivers of resilience. Results: At mid-century, biomass fully recovered to current conditions, but neither biomass nor species composition completely recovered at the end of the century. As expected, resilience was lower in the south, but by the end of the century, resilience was low throughout the landscape. Disturbance and species’ characteristics (e.g., the amount of area disturbed and the number of species) explained half of the variation in resilience, while temperature and soil moisture comprised only 17% collectively. Conclusions: Our results illustrate substantial spatial patterns of resilience at landscape scales, while documenting the potential for overall declines in resilience through time. Species diversity and windstorm size were far more important than temperature and soil moisture in driving long term trends in resilience. Finally, our research highlights the utility of using machine learning (e.g., boosted regression trees) to discern the underlying mechanisms of landscape-scale processes when using complex spatially-interactive and non-deterministic simulation models.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023908', 'afid': '60023908', 'affilname': 'Portland State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Portland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115699396', 'afid': '115699396', 'affilname': 'RPS', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lucash M.S.', 'Ruckert K.L.', 'Nicholas R.E.', 'Scheller R.M.', 'Smithwick E.A.H.']","['6506790985', '57192192940', '25925255100', '35615479500', '7003875365']",Climate change | Forest simulation model | LANDIS-II | Resilience | Windstorms,,1617396,,,1617396

Urban hydrology and green infrastructure (GI) can be modeled using the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) Urban tool and the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion (KINEROS2) model. The KINEROS2 model provides an urban modeling element with nine overland flow components that can be used to represent various land cover types commonly found in the built environment while treating runoff-runon and infiltration processes in a physically based manner. The AGWA Urban tool utilizes a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework to prepare parameters required for KINEROS2, executes the model, and imports results for visualization in the GIS. The AGWA Urban tool was validated on a residential subdivision in Arizona, USA, using 47 rainfall events (June 2005 to September 2006) to compare observed runoff volumes and peak flow rates with simulated results. Comparison of simulated and observed runoff volumes resulted in a slope of 1.00 for the regression equation with an R 2 value of 0.80. Comparison of observed and simulated peak flows had a slope of 1.12 with an R 2 value of 0.83. A roof runoff analysis was simulated for 787 events, from January 2006 through December 2015, to analyze the water availability from roof runoff capture. Simulation results indicated a 15% capture of the average monthly rainfall volume on the watershed. Additionally, rainwater captured from roofs has the potential to provide for up to 70% of the domestic annual per capita water use in this region. Five different scenarios (S1 - base, S2 - with retention basins, S3 - with permeable driveways, S4 - with rainwater harvesting cisterns, and S5 - all GI practices from S2, S3, and S4) were simulated over the same period to compare the effectiveness of GI implementation at the parcel level on runoff and peak flows at the watershed outlet. Simulation results indicate a higher runoff volume reduction for S2 (53.41 m 3 average capacity, average 30% reduction) as compared to S3 (average 14% reduction), or S4 (3.78 m 3 capacity, average 6% reduction). Analysis of peak flows reveal larger peak flow reduction for S2. S3 showed more reduction of smaller peak flows as compared to S4.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010621', 'afid': '60010621', 'affilname': 'USDA ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Korgaonkar Y.', 'Guertin D.', 'Goodrich D.', 'Unkrich C.', 'Kepner W.', 'Burns I.']","['55568147600', '35324240700', '56745856000', '15740019800', '6603309699', '9234907000']",AGWA | GIS | Green infrastructure | Hydrologic model | KINEROS2 | Semi-arid | Stormwater | Urban hydrology,NSF,1444758,National Science Foundation,,1518376

Population growth, climate change, and increasing stress on water resources evidence the urgency of adopting more sustainable urban water management practices. Drawing on contributions from the literature on informality, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Urbanism, and urban rainwater harvesting, we investigate DIY Urbanism as a specific type of informality and as a strategy for citizen action to push local governments to adopt and institutionalize water sustainability initiatives. Taking the city of Tucson, Arizona, a pioneer of arid urban rainwater harvesting practices, as a case study, we examine rainwater harvesting as a proposed sustainable urban water management practice for a water-stressed city with aging infrastructure and a growing population particularly vulnerable to a changing climate. Based on interviews, stakeholder meetings, and document analysis, this paper examines several elements of the rainwater harvesting movement in Tucson that both mesh with and differ from other types of informality. We find that although rainwater harvesting contributes to the vision of an urban utopia for some local activists and NGO actors, for those working within the municipal bureaucracy, it may be viewed as an attack on social order and private resource rights. Despite some loss of autonomy in implementing DIY Urbanism after its institutionalization and emerging maintenance issues, DIY Urbanists in Tucson continue to challenge official authority to remake the city. We caution that the subsequent institutionalization of urban rainwater harvesting should not further institutionalize inequities in access but rather promote greater water democracy in cities.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Elder A.', 'Gerlak A.']","['57209310894', '9633428500']",DIY Urbanism | Green infrastructure | Informality | Rainwater harvesting | Sustainable urban water management | Water democracy,,1518376,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0016718519301952,1518376

Anthropogenic noise is more intense at lower sound frequencies, which could decrease urban tolerance of animals with low-frequency vocalizations. Four large comparative studies tested whether anthropogenic noise filters bird species according to the sound frequencies they use and produced discrepant results. We reanalysed data from these studies to explain their different results. Urban tolerance of bird species (defined here as often occurring and breeding in cities) is very weakly related to urban preference or relative abundance (defined based on changes in population density from urban to nearby rural environments). Data on urban preference/abundance are potentially accurate for individual cities but differ among cities for the same species, whereas existing data on urban tolerance are coarser but provide a more global synthesis. Cross-species comparisons find a positive association between the sound frequency of song and urban tolerance, but not urban preference/abundance. We found that showing an association between song frequency and urban tolerance requires controlling for additional species traits that influence urban living. On the contrary, controlling for other species traits is not required to show a positive association between song frequency and use of noisy relative to quiet areas within the same type of environment. Together, comparative evidence indicates that masking by urban noise is part of a larger set of factors influencing urban living: all else being equal, species with high-frequency sounds are more likely to tolerate cities than species with low-frequency sounds, but they are not more likely to prefer, or to be more abundant in, urban than non-urban habitats.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030840', 'afid': '60030840', 'affilname': 'Københavns Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Copenhagen', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027821', 'afid': '60027821', 'affilname': 'Universidade do Porto, Centro de Investigação em Biodiversidade e Recursos Genéticos', 'affiliation-city': 'Fornelo e Vairao', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026553', 'afid': '60026553', 'affilname': 'University of Melbourne', 'affiliation-city': 'Parkville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cardoso G.', 'Hu Y.', 'Francis C.']","['16548956600', '55794313300', '27867753600']",Anthropogenic noise | Bird song | Noise-filter hypothesis | Sound frequency | Urban ecology,INCT-EN,SFRH/BPD/110165/2015,Instituto Nacional de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e NeuroproteÃ§Ã£o,,1414171

Published by Oxford University Press and the Society for Experimental Biology. Rates of human-induced environmental change continue increasing with human population size, potentially altering animal physiology and negatively affecting wildlife. Researchers often use glucocorticoid concentrations (hormones that can be associated with stressors) to gauge the impact of anthropogenic factors (e.g. urbanization, noise and light pollution). Yet, no general relationships between human-induced environmental change and glucocorticoids have emerged. Given the number of recent studies reporting baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (the primary glucocorticoid in birds and reptiles) concentrations worldwide, it is now possible to conduct large-scale comparative analyses to test for general associations between disturbance and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone across species. Additionally, we can control for factors that may influence context, such as life history stage, environmental conditions and urban adaptability of a species. Here, we take a phylogenetically informed approach and use data from HormoneBase to test if baseline and stress-induced corticosterone are valid indicators of exposure to human footprint index, human population density, anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night in birds and reptiles. Our results show a negative relationship between anthropogenic noise and baseline corticosterone for birds characterized as urban avoiders. While our results potentially indicate that urban avoiders are more sensitive to noise than other species, overall our study suggests that the relationship between human-induced environmental change and corticosterone varies across species and contexts; we found no general relationship between human impacts and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone in birds, nor baseline corticosterone in reptiles. Therefore, it should not be assumed that high or low levels of exposure to human-induced environmental change are associated with high or low corticosterone levels, respectively, or that closely related species, or even individuals, will respond similarly. Moving forward, measuring alternative physiological traits alongside reproductive success, health and survival may provide context to better understand the potential negative effects of human-induced environmental change.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030931', 'afid': '60030931', 'affilname': 'University of Oklahoma', 'affiliation-city': 'Norman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025525', 'afid': '60025525', 'affilname': 'Universität Konstanz', 'affiliation-city': 'Konstanz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023197', 'afid': '60023197', 'affilname': 'Trinity University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Antonio', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021850', 'afid': '60021850', 'affilname': 'Netherlands Institute of Ecology', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491', 'afid': '60018491', 'affilname': 'Simon Fraser University', 'affiliation-city': 'Burnaby', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011997', 'afid': '60011997', 'affilname': 'Cornell Lab of Ornithology', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011460', 'afid': '60011460', 'affilname': 'Brown University', 'affiliation-city': 'Providence', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009635', 'afid': '60009635', 'affilname': 'University of St. Thomas, Minnesota', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint Paul', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005460', 'afid': '60005460', 'affilname': 'Max Planck Institute for Ornithology', 'affiliation-city': 'Pocking', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001769', 'afid': '60001769', 'affilname': 'University of Nevada, Reno', 'affiliation-city': 'Reno', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001490', 'afid': '60001490', 'affilname': 'University of Glasgow', 'affiliation-city': 'Glasgow', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}]",Journal,Article,"['Injaian A.S.', 'Francis C.D.', 'Ouyang J.Q.', 'Dominoni D.M.', 'Donald J.W.', 'Fuxjager M.J.', 'Goymann W.', 'Hau M.', 'Husak J.F.', 'Johnson M.A.', 'Kircher B.K.', 'Knapp R.', 'Martin L.B.', 'Miller E.T.', 'Schoenle L.A.', 'Williams T.D.', 'Vitousek M.N.']","['55795215800', '27867753600', '37073184400', '55751235300', '57202251127', '26633708500', '6603723873', '7003983025', '6603585721', '55682655618', '56441403900', '35607756300', '57214404710', '23103889000', '57193337950', '7404172708', '8501389800']",anthropogenic noise | artificial light at night | glucocorticoid | human footprint | population density | stress,NSF,IOS-1656618,National Science Foundation,,1414171

Recent correlative studies document both negative and positive influences of noise pollution on reproductive success. Additionally, observational studies have not determined which stage of the breeding process is most vulnerable to noise pollution-settlement, incubation, and/or provisioning. Here, we controlled for possible effects from non-random settlement and eliminated potential effects of roadways, such as collisions and chemical and light pollution, by experimentally introducing traffic noise into nest boxes after clutch initiation in two secondary-cavity nesting bird species. We found no evidence for an influence of noise on clutch size, brood size, number of fledglings, or overall nest success in western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). In contrast, we found that ash-throated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens) nests exposed to noise had lower reproductive success than quiet nests due to higher rates of abandonment at the incubation stage. Our results match recent research demonstrating that ash-throated flycatchers avoid energy-sector noise in their nest placement and, when they do nest in noise, experience stress hormone dysregulation and fitness costs. The lack of a response among western bluebirds differs from reported declines in reproductive success due to exposure to energy-sector noise; however, the absence of a response matches the response seen in other species using an in-box noise playback experiment. These results suggest that in-box noise exposure experiments may be appropriate for assessing noise impacts at the nest, and through some pathways (e.g., direct effects of noise on nestlings), but do not capture other ways in which noise can negatively affect birds during the breeding season that may ultimately cause declines in fitness. Additionally, although manipulative experiments that examine the influence of a single anthropogenic stressor on a single life stage can help reveal causal pathways, urban and other human-dominated environments are characterized by many stressors and future studies should seek to understand how noise interacts with other stressors to impact birds and other wildlife. Finally, in light of mounting evidence demonstrating declines in reproductive success due to noise, our results suggest that nest box placement near roads may be counterproductive to efforts to bolster population densities of some species.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mulholland T.', 'Ferraro D.', 'Boland K.', 'Ivey K.', 'Le M.', 'LaRiccia C.', 'Vigianelli J.', 'Francis C.']","['57204452759', '57204455500', '57204455882', '57204461733', '57204452881', '57204459320', '57204457956', '27867753600']",,,undefined,,,1414171

Global expansion of human activities is associated with the introduction of novel stimuli, such as anthropogenic noise, artificial lights and chemical agents. Progress in documenting the ecological effects of sensory pollutants is weakened by sparse knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects. This severely limits our capacity to devise mitigation measures. Here, we integrate knowledge of animal sensory ecology, physiology and life history to articulate three perceptual mechanisms—masking, distracting and misleading—that clearly explain how and why anthropogenic sensory pollutants impact organisms. We then link these three mechanisms to ecological consequences and discuss their implications for conservation. We argue that this framework can reveal the presence of ‘sensory danger zones’, hotspots of conservation concern where sensory pollutants overlap in space and time with an organism’s activity, and foster development of strategic interventions to mitigate the impact of sensory pollutants. Future research that applies this framework will provide critical insight to preserve the natural sensory world.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031706', 'afid': '60031706', 'affilname': 'Utah State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Logan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028629', 'afid': '60028629', 'affilname': 'College of Science', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021850', 'afid': '60021850', 'affilname': 'Netherlands Institute of Ecology', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016933', 'afid': '60016933', 'affilname': 'US National Park Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012851', 'afid': '60012851', 'affilname': 'State University of New York at Plattsburgh', 'affiliation-city': 'Plattsburgh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008734', 'afid': '60008734', 'affilname': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003631', 'afid': '60003631', 'affilname': 'Western Washington University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bellingham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001490', 'afid': '60001490', 'affilname': 'University of Glasgow', 'affiliation-city': 'Glasgow', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001456', 'afid': '60001456', 'affilname': 'Boise State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000673', 'afid': '60000673', 'affilname': 'Environment Canada', 'affiliation-city': 'Gatineau', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/124173598', 'afid': '124173598', 'affilname': 'Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Group', 'affiliation-city': 'Calgary', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123016668', 'afid': '123016668', 'affilname': 'Exponent', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dominoni D.M.', 'Halfwerk W.', 'Baird E.', 'Buxton R.T.', 'Fernández-Juricic E.', 'Fristrup K.M.', 'McKenna M.F.', 'Mennitt D.J.', 'Perkin E.K.', 'Seymoure B.M.', 'Stoner D.C.', 'Tennessen J.B.', 'Toth C.A.', 'Tyrrell L.P.', 'Wilson A.', 'Francis C.D.', 'Carter N.H.', 'Barber J.R.']","['55751235300', '24366756300', '9238931300', '36643563700', '7004563484', '6603649542', '8503556500', '36457256800', '37027011600', '56083775200', '15133312600', '55764620600', '57216151509', '55946578200', '57193749417', '27867753600', '36023211300', '17344847400']",,NASA,NNX17AG36G,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,1414171

The soundscape serves as a backdrop for acoustic signals dispatched within and among species, spanning mate attraction to parasite host detection. Elevated background sound levels from human-made and natural sources may interfere with the reception of acoustic signals and alter species interactions and whole ecological communities. We investigated whether background noise influences the ability of the obligate parasitoid Ormia ochracea to locate its host, the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps). As O. ochracea use auditory cues to locate their hosts, we hypothesized that higher background noise levels would mask or distract flies from cricket calls and result in a decreased ability to detect and navigate to hosts. We used a field manipulation where fly traps baited with playback of male cricket advertisement calls were exposed to a gradient of experimental traffic and ocean surf noise. We found that increases in noise amplitude caused a significant decline in O. ochracea caught, suggesting that background noise can influence parasitoid–host interactions and potentially benefit hosts. As human-caused sensory pollution increases globally, soundscapes may influence the evolution of tightly co-evolved host–parasitoid relationships. Future work should investigate whether female cricket phonotaxis towards males is similarly affected by noise levels.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Phillips J.', 'Ruef S.', 'Garvin C.', 'Le M.', 'Francis C.']","['57189214136', '57211273053', '57211073323', '57204452881', '27867753600']",Experimental playback | Gryllus lineaticeps | Host–parasitoid interactions | Noise pollution | Ormia ochracea | Soundscape,NSF,DEB-1556192,National Science Foundation,,1414171

Although decades of research have documented a variety of negative impacts of noise to organisms, key gaps remain, such as how noise affects different taxa within a biological community and how effects of noise propagate across space. We experimentally applied traffic noise pollution to multiple roadless areas and quantified the impacts of noise on birds, grasshoppers and odonates. We show that acoustically oriented birds have reduced species richness and abundance and different community compositions in experimentally noise-exposed areas relative to comparable quiet locations. We also found both acoustically oriented grasshoppers and odonates without acoustic receptors to have reduced species richness and/or abundance in relatively quiet areas that abut noise-exposed areas. These results suggest that noise pollution not only affects acoustically oriented animals, but that noise may reverberate through biological communities through indirect effects to those with no clear links to the acoustic realm, even in adjacent quiet environments.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030939', 'afid': '60030939', 'affilname': 'National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan', 'affiliation-city': 'Tsukuba', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014652', 'afid': '60014652', 'affilname': 'Hokkaido University', 'affiliation-city': 'Sapporo', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Senzaki M.', 'Kadoya T.', 'Francis C.D.']","['56380383600', '7005480966', '27867753600']",Biological diversity | Biotic interaction | Noise pollution | Road ecology | Top-down control | Traffic noise,NSF,1556192,National Science Foundation,,1414171

A substantial body of literature has examined protected areas’ performance in preserving soundscapes and management strategies to ensure the continued preservation of natural sounds in park settings. However, protected areas’ abilities to abate noise are not understood to such a robust degree, especially concerning how noise abatement occurs at a landscape scale. Few studies have considered green space noise abatement beyond a city-scale. This study utilizes two national datasets previously employed in a study of soundscape preservation to examine what characteristics of protected areas aid in the abatement of noise at the county level. Using spatial regression models, this study represents the first assessment of conservation status, ownership, and level of access as potential determinates of abatement performance.

In this study, the impact of sounds from natural gas compressors in Pennsylvania State Forests is explored. Using data collected from over 400 onsite visitors, researchers developed a threshold model that shows how visitor experiences change with sounds from natural gas compressors. The threshold model shows that increased sound levels (dBA) from natural gas compressors have a negative impact on visitor experiences.

Noise is a globally pervasive pollutant that can be detrimental to a range of animal species, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. As a result, concern about the impacts and expanding footprint of anthropogenic noise is increasing along with interest in approaches for how to mitigate its negative effects. A variety of modeling tools have been developed to quantify the spatial distribution and intensity of noise across landscapes, but these tools are under-utilized in landscape planning and noise mitigation. Here, we apply the Sound Mapping Tools toolbox to evaluate mitigation approaches to reduce the anthropogenic noise footprint of gas development, summer all-terrain vehicle recreation, and winter snowmobile use. Sound Mapping Tools uses models of the physics of noise propagation to convert measured source levels to landscape predictions of relevant sound levels. We found that relatively minor changes to the location of noise-producing activities could dramatically reduce the extent and intensity of noise in focal areas, indicating that site planning can be a cost-effective approach to noise mitigation. In addition, our snowmobile results, which focus on a specific frequency band important to the focal species, are consistent with previous research demonstrating that source noise level reductions are an effective means to reduce noise footprints. We recommend the use of quantitative, spatially-explicit maps of expected noise levels that include alternative options for noise source placement. These maps can be used to guide management decisions, allow for species-specific insights, and to reduce noise impacts on animals and ecosystems.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016933', 'afid': '60016933', 'affilname': 'US National Park Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001456', 'afid': '60001456', 'affilname': 'Boise State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001012', 'afid': '60001012', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Keyel A.', 'Reed S.', 'Nuessly K.', 'Cinto-Mejia E.', 'Barber J.', 'Wittemyer G.']","['12753848000', '9638376300', '46861417100', '57203570328', '17344847400', '8622054200']",Conservation | Masking | NMSIMGIS | Recreation | Sound Mapping Tools | SPreAD-GIS,WCS,undefined,Wildlife Conservation Society,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169204618308065,1414171

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2019 British Ecological Society Altered animal distributions are a consequence of human expansion and development. Anthropogenic noise can be an important predictor of abundance declines near human infrastructure, yet more information is needed to understand noise impacts at the spatial and temporal scales necessary to alter populations. Energy development and associated anthropogenic noise are globally pervasive, and expanding. For example, 600,000 new natural gas wells have been drilled across central North America in less than 20 years. We experimentally broadcast energy sector noise (recordings of compressor engines) in Southwest Idaho (USA). We placed arrays of speakers creating a ‘phantom natural gas field' in a large-scale experiment and tested the effects of noise alone on breeding songbird abundance. To examine variation in human-caused noise, we broadcast two types of compressor noise, one with a slightly higher sound intensity and greater bandwidth than the other. Our phantom natural gas field encompassed approximately 100 km2. We broadcast noise over three continuous months, for each of two seasons, and quantified over 20,000 hr of background sound levels. Brewer's sparrows (Spizella breweri) were affected by our narrowband playback, declining 30%, 50 m from the speaker arrays. During our broadband playback, all species combined and Brewer's sparrows decreased 20% and 33%, respectively, at the scale of our sites (~0.5 km2; up to 400 m from speaker arrays). Synthesis and applications. Our results show the importance of incorporating the acoustic structure of noise when estimating the cost of noise exposure for populations.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. All rights reserved. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are stress hormones that can strongly influence physiology, behavior, and an organism’s ability to cope with environmental change. Despite their importance, and the wealth of studies that have sought to understand how and why GC concentrations vary within species, we do not have a clear understanding of how circulating GC levels vary within and across the major vertebrate clades. New research has proposed that much interspecific variation in GC concentrations can be explained by variation in metabolism and body mass. Specifically, GC concentrations should vary proportionally with mass-specific metabolic rates and, given known scaling relationships between body mass and metabolic rate, GC concentrations should scale to the -1/4 power of body mass and to the power of 1 with mass-specific metabolic rate. Here, we use HormoneBase, the newly compiled database that includes plasma GC concentrations from free-living and unmanipulated vertebrates, to evaluate this hypothesis. Specifically, we explored the relationships between body mass or mass-specific metabolic rate and either baseline or stress-induced GC (cortisol or corticosterone) concentrations in tetrapods. Our phylogenetically-informed models suggest that, whereas the relationship between GC concentrations and body mass across tetrapods and among mammals is close to -1/4 power, this relationship does not exist in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Moreover, with the exception of a positive association between stress-induced GC concentrations and mass-specific metabolic rate in birds, we found little evidence that GC concentrations are linked to metabolic rate, although the number of species sampled was quite limited for amphibians and somewhat so for reptiles and mammals. Nevertheless, these results stand in contrast to the generally accepted association between the two and suggest that our observed positive association between body mass and GC concentrations may not be due to the well-established link between mass and metabolism. Large-scale comparative approaches can come with drawbacks, such as pooling and pairing observations from separate sources. However, these broad analyses provide an important counterbalance to the majority of studies examining variation in GC concentrations at the population or species level, and can be a powerful approach to testing both long-standing and new questions in biology.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033114', 'afid': '60033114', 'affilname': 'Wake Forest University', 'affiliation-city': 'Winston Salem', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030931', 'afid': '60030931', 'affilname': 'University of Oklahoma', 'affiliation-city': 'Norman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025525', 'afid': '60025525', 'affilname': 'Universität Konstanz', 'affiliation-city': 'Konstanz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023197', 'afid': '60023197', 'affilname': 'Trinity University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Antonio', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491', 'afid': '60018491', 'affilname': 'Simon Fraser University', 'affiliation-city': 'Burnaby', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015348', 'afid': '60015348', 'affilname': 'Hamilton College', 'affiliation-city': 'Clinton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011997', 'afid': '60011997', 'affilname': 'Cornell Lab of Ornithology', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009635', 'afid': '60009635', 'affilname': 'University of St. Thomas, Minnesota', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint Paul', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005460', 'afid': '60005460', 'affilname': 'Max Planck Institute for Ornithology', 'affiliation-city': 'Pocking', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}]",Journal,Article,"['Francis C.D.', 'Donald J.W.', 'Fuxjager M.J.', 'Goymann W.', 'Hau M.', 'Husak J.F.', 'Johnson M.A.', 'Kircher B.K.', 'Knapp R.', 'Martin L.B.', 'Miller E.T.', 'Schoenle L.A.', 'Vitousek M.N.', 'Williams T.D.', 'Downs C.J.']","['27867753600', '57202251127', '26633708500', '6603723873', '7003983025', '6603585721', '55682655618', '56441403900', '35607756300', '57214404710', '23103889000', '57193337950', '8501389800', '7404172708', '25639691800']",,,IOS-1457251,,,1414171

To address this knowledge gap, we excluded avian predators from shrubs during the growing season using netting in a sagebrush steppe environment. We compared arthropod abundance, shrub herbivory damage, physiology (gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence), litter chemistry (C/N ratios and concentrations of phenolic compounds) and decomposition between netted and un-netted (control) sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) shrubs across a growing season. While there were clear seasonal patterns in measurements, we observed no statistically significant differences between netting treatments in any of these measurements, though abundances of arthropods in the sap-feeding trophic guilds were appreciably greater (although not significantly) on netted compared to un-netted shrubs.

Recent correlative studies document both negative and positive influences of noise pollution on reproductive success. Additionally, observational studies have not determined which stage of the breeding process is most vulnerable to noise pollution-settlement, incubation, and/or provisioning. Here, we controlled for possible effects from non-random settlement and eliminated potential effects of roadways, such as collisions and chemical and light pollution, by experimentally introducing traffic noise into nest boxes after clutch initiation in two secondary-cavity nesting bird species. We found no evidence for an influence of noise on clutch size, brood size, number of fledglings, or overall nest success in western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). In contrast, we found that ash-throated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens) nests exposed to noise had lower reproductive success than quiet nests due to higher rates of abandonment at the incubation stage. Our results match recent research demonstrating that ash-throated flycatchers avoid energy-sector noise in their nest placement and, when they do nest in noise, experience stress hormone dysregulation and fitness costs. The lack of a response among western bluebirds differs from reported declines in reproductive success due to exposure to energy-sector noise; however, the absence of a response matches the response seen in other species using an in-box noise playback experiment. These results suggest that in-box noise exposure experiments may be appropriate for assessing noise impacts at the nest, and through some pathways (e.g., direct effects of noise on nestlings), but do not capture other ways in which noise can negatively affect birds during the breeding season that may ultimately cause declines in fitness. Additionally, although manipulative experiments that examine the influence of a single anthropogenic stressor on a single life stage can help reveal causal pathways, urban and other human-dominated environments are characterized by many stressors and future studies should seek to understand how noise interacts with other stressors to impact birds and other wildlife. Finally, in light of mounting evidence demonstrating declines in reproductive success due to noise, our results suggest that nest box placement near roads may be counterproductive to efforts to bolster population densities of some species.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mulholland T.', 'Ferraro D.', 'Boland K.', 'Ivey K.', 'Le M.', 'LaRiccia C.', 'Vigianelli J.', 'Francis C.']","['57204452759', '57204455500', '57204455882', '57204461733', '57204452881', '57204459320', '57204457956', '27867753600']",,,undefined,,,1414171

Emerging evidence indicates that anthropogenic noise has highly detrimental impacts on natural communities; however, the effects of noise on acoustically specialized predators has received less attention. We demonstrate experimentally that natural gas compressor station noise impairs the hunting behavior of northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadius). We presented 31 wild-caught owls with prey inside a field-placed flight tent under acoustic conditions found 50-800 m (46-73 dBA) from a compressor station. To assess how noise affected hunting, we postulated two hypotheses. First, hunting deficits might increase with increasing noise-the dose-response hypothesis. Secondly, the noise levels used in this experiment might equally impair hunting, or produce no impact-the threshold hypothesis. Using a model selection framework, we tested these hypotheses for multiple dependent variables-including overall hunting success and each step in the attack sequence (prey detection, strike, and capture). The dose-response hypothesis was supported for overall hunting success, prey detection, and strike behavior. For each decibel increase in noise, the odds of hunting success decreased by 8% (CI 4.5%-11.0%). The odds of prey detection and strike behavior also decreased with increasing noise, falling 11% (CI 7%-16%) and 5% (CI 5%-6%), respectively.

However, a growing body of research also suggests that the delivery of visitors via transit to destinations within a park or protected area may have unique ecological disturbance implications resulting from increased visitor use, density, and altered spatial and temporal use patterns. In this paper, we examine the relevant literature and present examples from recent research that illustrates the potential range of ecologic impacts from visitor deliveries via park transportation systems. We conclude while transit systems remain very desirable in park settings, depending on a range of situational factors, conventional, demand-driven planning and management approaches may result in unintended impacts to ecological conditions. Overall, this discussion provides a framework for improved management of the potential ecological impacts of protected area transportation systems.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031706', 'afid': '60031706', 'affilname': 'Utah State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Logan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023112', 'afid': '60023112', 'affilname': 'Resource Systems Group', 'affiliation-city': 'White River Junction', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001456', 'afid': '60001456', 'affilname': 'Boise State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Monz C.', ""D'Antonio A."", 'Lawson S.', 'Barber J.', 'Newman P.']","['6602147300', '55313918100', '13806039400', '17344847400', '7202400378']",Protected area management | Recreation ecology | Transportation ecology | Transportation in parks | Visitor management,UAES,undefined,Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0966692315002057,1414171

Birds breeding in heterogeneous landscapes select nest sites by cueing in on a variety of factors from landscape features and social information to the presence of natural enemies. We focus on determining the relative impact of anthropogenic noise on nest site occupancy, compared to amount of forest cover, which is known to strongly influence the selection process. We examine chronic, industrial noise from natural gas wells directly measured at the nest box as well as site-averaged noise, using a well-established field experimental system in northwestern New Mexico. We hypothesized that high levels of noise, both at the nest site and in the environment, would decrease nest box occupancy. We set up nest boxes using a geospatially paired control and experimental site design and analyzed four years of occupancy data from four secondary cavity-nesting birds common to the Colorado Plateau. We found different effects of noise and landscape features depending on species, with strong effects of noise observed in breeding habitat selection of Myiarchus cinerascens, the Ash-throated Flycatcher, and Sialia currucoides, the Mountain Bluebird. In contrast, the amount of forest cover less frequently explained habitat selection for those species or had a smaller standardized effect than the acoustic environment.

However, biodiversity preservation and visitor access are often at odds and creative solutions are needed to safeguard protected area natural resources in the face of high visitor use. Managing human impacts to natural soundscapes could serve as a powerful tool for resolving these conflicting objectives. Here, we review emerging research that demonstrates that the acoustic environment is critical to wildlife and that sounds shape the quality of nature-based experiences for humans. Human-made noise is known to affect animal behavior, distributions and reproductive success, and the organization of ecological communities. Additionally, new research suggests that interactions with nature, including natural sounds, confer benefits to human welfare termed psychological ecosystem services. In areas influenced by noise, elevated human-made noise not only limits the variety and abundance of organisms accessible to outdoor recreationists, but also impairs their capacity to perceive the wildlife that remains. Thus soundscape changes can degrade, and potentially limit the benefits derived from experiences with nature via indirect and direct mechanisms. We discuss the effects of noise on wildlife and visitors through the concept of listening area and demonstrate how the perceptual worlds of both birds and humans are reduced by noise. Finally, we discuss how management of soundscapes in protected areas may be an innovative solution to safeguarding both and recommend several key questions and research directions to stimulate new research.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031706', 'afid': '60031706', 'affilname': 'Utah State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Logan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027474', 'afid': '60027474', 'affilname': 'North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016933', 'afid': '60016933', 'affilname': 'US National Park Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002126', 'afid': '60002126', 'affilname': 'Grand Teton National Park', 'affiliation-city': 'Moose', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001456', 'afid': '60001456', 'affilname': 'Boise State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000454', 'afid': '60000454', 'affilname': 'Peregrine Fund Incorporated', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Francis C.D.', 'Newman P.', 'Taff B.D.', 'White C.', 'Monz C.A.', 'Levenhagen M.', 'Petrelli A.R.', 'Abbott L.C.', 'Newton J.', 'Burson S.', 'Cooper C.B.', 'Fristrup K.M.', 'McClure C.J.W.', 'Mennitt D.', 'Giamellaro M.', 'Barber J.R.']","['27867753600', '7202400378', '55363495700', '8204446100', '6602147300', '57195282897', '57195282807', '57195287594', '57195280452', '36996469500', '7403318955', '6603649542', '35776447000', '36457256800', '55303708300', '17344847400']",Anthropogenic noise | Coupled dynamic | Listening area | Park paradox | Protected areas | Psychological ecosystem services | Soundscape | Wildlife,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0301479717307193,1414171

Throughout the world, birds represent the primary type of wildlife that people experience on a daily basis. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that alterations to the acoustic environment can negatively affect birds as well as humans in a variety of ways, and altered acoustics from noise pollution has the potential to influence human interactions with wild birds. Birds respond to approaching humans in a manner analogous to approaching predators, but the context of the interaction can also greatly influence the distance at which a bird initiates flight or escape behavior (i.e., flight initiation distance or FID). Here, we hypothesized that reliance on different sensory modalities to balance foraging and threat detection can influence how birds respond to approaching threats in the presence of background noise. We surveyed 12 songbird species in California and Wyoming and categorized each species into one of three foraging guilds: ground foragers, canopy gleaners, and hawking flycatchers and predicted FIDs to decrease, remain the same and increase with noise exposure, respectively. Contrary to expectations, the canopy gleaning and flycatching guilds exhibited mixed responses, with some species exhibiting unchanged FIDs with noise while others exhibited increased FIDs with noise. However, FIDs of all ground foraging species and one canopy gleaner decreased with noise levels. Additionally, we found no evidence of phylogenetic structure among species' mean FID responses and only weak phylogenetic structure for the relationship between FIDs and noise levels. Although our results provide mixed support for foraging strategy as a predictor of bird response to noise, our finding that most of the species we surveyed have shorter FIDs with increases in noise levels suggest that human observers may be able to approach ground foraging species more closely under noisy conditions. From an ecological perspective, however, it remains unclear whether these mixed responses translate into lost foraging opportunity for hypervigilant birds that flee a threat too soon or greater predation risk due to impaired surveillance for those that only respond once approaching threats are near.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001456', 'afid': '60001456', 'affilname': 'Boise State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Petrelli A.', 'Levenhagen M.', 'Wardle R.', 'Barber J.', 'Francis C.']","['57195282807', '57195282897', '57196061675', '17344847400', '27867753600']",Anthropogenic noise | Birdwatching | Escape behavior | Masking | Predation risk | Threat detection | Vigilance,,undefined,,,1414171

Native Americans created shell middens along estuarine shorelines, and these archeologically significant sites are now threatened by erosion and sea level rise. We worked with Canaveral National Seashore to apply living shoreline techniques to protect middens using stabilized oyster shell, Spartina alterniflora, and Rhizophora mangle. Deployed mangroves were successful in terms of survival, growth, and reproduction, but natural recruitment following stabilization was minimal. After evaluating natural mangrove recruitment at stabilized and neighboring shorelines, we found propagule and seedling counts were significantly lower at stabilized shorelines. Third, we experimentally tested effects of varying sediment grain sizes on R. mangle. Overall, survival and growth were high in all treatments, suggesting that seedlings were not inhibited by the presence of large oyster shell fragments. Combined, this suggests that the retention and transition of the R. mangle propagule into a seedling is being limited in the field. Large shell potentially acts as a barrier for initial anchoring in the sediment or increasing likelihood of dislodgement during movement by boat or wind wakes. The human-altered substrate at shell middens may prevent natural recovery of vegetated shorelines, highlighting the need for on-going management for long-term protection of these archeological sites.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022144', 'afid': '60022144', 'affilname': 'University of Central Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Orlando', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Donnelly M.', 'Shaffer M.', 'Connor S.', 'Sacks P.', 'Walters L.']","['7102824762', '57193671372', '57193673222', '57213168361', '7102237295']",Living shoreline | Rhizophora mangle | Shell midden | Shoreline stabilization | Spartina alterniflora,UCF,1617374,University of Central Florida,,1617374

It is often a challenge to predict the impact of ecosystem restoration because many critical relationships and feedbacks between natural and human systems are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce a novel framework to characterize restoration dynamics within coupled human-natural systems. Because dynamics surrounding restoration are complex, we investigate the potential for sense of place, i.e., emotional attachment to place, to elucidate relationships between human and natural systems during times of change, such as restoration. Integrating sense of place with ecological metrics, a typology of restoration scenarios that exemplify complex relationships between social and ecological drivers emerges. We propose an identify-visualize-create framework for parsing restoration objectives and curating sense of place around the functional ecosystem state.

Introduction of C. virginica into estuarine areas with limited or no extant populations is gaining popularity as a pro-active approach for improving estuarine water quality and creating natural wave breaks for shoreline stabilization. Adult oysters, grown by 113 community members under their private docks, were collected and deployed at three county-owned sites along the Indian River Lagoon within Brevard County, Florida. In this shallow, warm-water estuary, replicate treatments deployed at each site included bagged adult oysters collected from gardeners in fall 2014, bagged adult oysters from spring 2015 gardeners, bagged blank (clean) shell, and empty plots (control). Prior to deployment, morphometric data (shell length, weight) were collected on all gardened oysters. Morphometric data were then collected quarterly for all surviving and recruited oysters for 18 months. Our monitoring timeframe was sufficient for assessing survival of gardened oysters, but likely not sufficient to understand recruitment patterns. In areas with no recruitment and limited gardened oyster survival, regular enhancement with live oysters would be needed for long-term success. In areas with natural recruitment, the blank shell treatment was most successful. Lessons learned from this study include: (1) need for better tracking of abiotic variables (e.g. salinity) where gardening occurred, (2) role of seasonality in initial post-deployment survival, even in a warm-water estuary, and (3) importance of pilot studies prior to large-scale gardened oyster deployments.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022144', 'afid': '60022144', 'affilname': 'University of Central Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Orlando', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101190727', 'afid': '101190727', 'affilname': 'Office of Natural Resources Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Melbourne', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Anderson L.', 'Sacks P.', 'Donnelly M.', 'Barker V.', 'Anderson S.', 'Walters L.']","['57209331114', '57213168361', '7102824762', '57209329395', '57209330840', '7102237295']",Brevard County | citizen science | Crassostrea virginica | Florida | Indian River Lagoon | oyster gardening,,undefined,,,1617374

However, there remains uncertainty about the effectiveness of shoreline protection provided by oyster reefs, which limits their broader application. We draw evidence from studies along the east and gulf coasts of the United States, where much research and implementation of oyster reef restoration has occurred, to better define the existing gaps in our understanding of the use of restored oyster reefs for shoreline protection.

The restoration of dead/degraded oyster reefs is increasingly pursued worldwide to reestablish harvestable populations or renew ecosystem services. Evidence suggests that oysters can improve water quality, but less is known about the role of associated benthic sediments in promoting biogeochemical processes, such as nutrient cycling and burial. There is also limited understanding of if, or how long postrestoration, a site functions like a natural reef. This study investigated key biogeochemical properties (e.g., physiochemical properties, nutrient pools, microbial community size and activity) in the sediments of dead reefs; 1-, 4-, and 7-year-old restored reefs; and natural reference reefs of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in Mosquito Lagoon (FL, USA). Results indicated that most of the measured biogeochemical properties (dissolved organic carbon (C), NH4+, total C, total nitrogen (N), and the activity of major extracellular enzymes involved in C, N, and phosphorus (P) cycling) increased significantly by 1-year postrestoration, relative to dead reefs, and then remained fairly constant as the reefs continued to age. Few differences were observed in biogeochemical properties between restored reefs of any age (1 to 7 years) and natural reference reefs. Variability among reefs of the same treatment category was often correlated with differences in the number of live oysters, reef thickness, and/or the availability of C and N in the sediments. Overall, this study demonstrates the role of live intertidal oyster reefs as biogeochemical hot spots for nutrient cycling and burial and the rapidity (within 1 year) with which biogeochemical properties can be reestablished following successful restoration.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022144', 'afid': '60022144', 'affilname': 'University of Central Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Orlando', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101868177', 'afid': '101868177', 'affilname': 'Winter Springs High School', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chambers L.', 'Gaspar S.', 'Pilato C.', 'Steinmuller H.', 'McCarthy K.', 'Sacks P.', 'Walters L.']","['54419539400', '57195556804', '57195556657', '57190668399', '57195553600', '57213168361', '7102237295']",Biogeochemistry | Carbon | Crassostrea virginica | Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Restoration | Shellfish,BCS,1617374,Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences,,1617374

Agricultural intensification to feed the growing rural population, livestock pressure on native vegetation, and climate change converge to exacerbate soil erosion, creating a significant threat to crop productivity and rural livelihoods. Farmer trainings can be a potent strategy to increase farmer awareness of the larger causes of soil loss, help farmers adapt to or mitigate environmental challenges, and improve crop outputs and incomes. However, evaluations of farmer training programs rarely assess socioeconomic and environmental outcomes simultaneously. Our study uses multiple methods to estimate the socio-ecological effects of a soil and water conservation training program for farmers implemented by ADHENO Integrated Rural Development Association, an Ethiopian non-governmental organization. We asked: (a) did farmers use practices taught in trainings; (b) did these strategies lead to improved agricultural productivity or livelihoods; and (c) how did land-use intensity change in areas with more participation in farmer trainings? To address questions (a) and (b), our study and results are based on 449 household surveys, collected between June and August 2017, in two rural kebeles in Ethiopia in which ADHENO has been active since 2003. We used remote sensing analysis of high resolution satellite images to measure land-use change over a period of nine years, addressing question (c) for one of the kebeles. Analysis of household surveys with propensity score matching and robustness checks suggests that participation in farmer trainings predicts the implementation of four out of seven soil conservation farming methods. Participants in training sessions also had higher average incomes from agriculture than non-participants. Linear models of land-use change in the area around villages did not depict a clear relationship between participation in farmer trainings and change in land-use intensity. These results indicate that farmer trainings focusing on soil and water conservation have the potential to influence farming practices and livelihoods and have implications for soil conservation efforts in the Ethiopian Highlands. This study highlights the importance of evaluating the impacts of small, localized development interventions, of which there are many in sub-Saharan Africa, to better understand the ways in which myriad types of programs influence both land use and livelihoods.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122715833', 'afid': '122715833', 'affilname': 'Environmental Incentives', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chesterman N.', 'Entwistle J.', 'Chambers M.', 'Liu H.', 'Agrawal A.', 'Brown D.']","['57209329156', '57209326203', '57209329967', '57209332078', '35241715800', '56975641800']",Ethiopia | Farmer training | Land-use change | Land-use land-cover classification | Smallholder agriculture | Soil conservation,CLUI,NNX15AD40G,Center for Land Use Interpretation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S026483771831411X,1617364

Contemporary large-scale land transactions (LSLTs), also called land grabs, are historically unprecedented in their scale and pace. They have provoked robust scholarly debates, yet studies of their gender-differentiated impacts remain more rare, particularly when it comes to how changes in control over land and resources affect women's labor, and thereby their livelihoods and well-being. Our comparative study of four LSLTs in western Ethiopia finds that the transactions led to substantial land use change, including relocation and decrease in size of smallholder parcels, loss of communally-held grazing lands, and loss of forests. These changes had far-reaching impacts on household labor allocation, the gendered division of labor, and household wellbeing. But their effects on women are both more adverse and more severe, expressed in terms of increased wage labor to make up for lost land and livestock, more time spent gathering firewood and water from increasingly distant locations, and an increased intensity of household responsibilities where male members underwent wage labor migration. These burdens led to negative psychological, corporal, and material effects on women living in and near transacted areas compared to their situation prior to transactions.

Several studies have established that cases exhibit sensitivity to intra- and inter annual climate variability, peaking during the hot and dry boreal spring months, raising concern that future climate change may increase the incidence of meningitis in the region. The impact of future climate change on meningitis risk in north west Nigeria is assessed by forcing an empirical model of meningitis with monthly simulations of seven meteorological variables from an ensemble of 13 statistically downscaled global climate model projections from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Inter comparison Experiment (CMIP5) for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5 scenarios, with the numbers representing the globally averaged top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance (in Wm22) in 2100. The results suggest future temperature increases due to climate change have the potential to significantly increase meningitis cases in both the early (2020-35) and late (2060-75) twenty-first century, and for the seasonal onset of meningitis to begin about a month earlier on average by late century, in October rather than November. Annual incidence may increase by 47%6 8%, 64%6 9%, and 99%6 12%for the RCP 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, in 2060-75 with respect to 1990-2005.

Background: Cooking over open fires using solid fuels is both common practice throughout much of the world and widely recognized to contribute to human health, environmental, and social problems. The public health burden of household air pollution includes an estimated four million premature deaths each year. To be effective and generate useful insight into potential solutions, cookstove intervention studies must select cooking technologies that are appropriate for local socioeconomic conditions and cooking culture, and include interdisciplinary measurement strategies along a continuum of outcomes. Methods/Design: REACCTING (Research on Emissions, Air quality, Climate, and Cooking Technologies in Northern Ghana) is an ongoing interdisciplinary randomized cookstove intervention study in the Kassena-Nankana District of Northern Ghana. The study tests two types of biomass burning stoves that have the potential to meet local cooking needs and represent different ""rungs"" in the cookstove technology ladder: a locally-made low-tech rocket stove and the imported, highly efficient Philips gasifier stove. Intervention households were randomized into four different groups, three of which received different combinations of two improved stoves, while the fourth group serves as a control for the duration of the study. Diverse measurements assess different points along the causal chain linking the intervention to final outcomes of interest. We assess stove use and cooking behavior, cooking emissions, household air pollution and personal exposure, health burden, and local to regional air quality. Integrated analysis and modeling will tackle a range of interdisciplinary science questions, including examining ambient exposures among the regional population, assessing how those exposures might change with different technologies and behaviors, and estimating the comparative impact of local behavior and technological changes versus regional climate variability and change on local air quality and health outcomes. Discussion: REACCTING is well-poised to generate useful data on the impact of a cookstove intervention on a wide range of outcomes. By comparing different technologies side by side and employing an interdisciplinary approach to study this issue from multiple perspectives, this study may help to inform future efforts to improve health and quality of life for populations currently relying on open fires for their cooking needs.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071890', 'afid': '60071890', 'affilname': 'Navrongo Health Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Navrongo', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071871', 'afid': '60071871', 'affilname': 'Ghana Health Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Accra', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021243', 'afid': '60021243', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115200310', 'afid': '115200310', 'affilname': 'Relief International', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Angeles', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dickinson K.', 'Kanyomse E.', 'Piedrahita R.', 'Coffey E.', 'Rivera I.', 'Adoctor J.', 'Alirigia R.', 'Muvandimwe D.', 'Dove M.', 'Dukic V.', 'Hayden M.', 'Diaz-Sanchez D.', 'Abisiba A.', 'Anaseba D.', 'Hagar Y.', 'Masson N.', 'Monaghan A.', 'Titiati A.', 'Steinhoff D.', 'Hsu Y.', 'Kaspar R.', 'Brooks B.', 'Hodgson A.', 'Hannigan M.', 'Oduro A.', 'Wiedinmyer C.']","['26427583800', '56610396600', '36178445000', '56609988800', '56609945500', '56610393700', '56610265000', '56610340700', '56771556300', '8446677800', '9635846500', '7004624772', '56610329800', '55821731500', '26535969700', '56387129500', '7005133082', '56610240800', '23669047500', '56609634200', '56609953000', '56771552800', '7101639287', '7004176296', '57196872080', '6602352339']",Cookstoves | Global health | Household air pollution | Randomized intervention study | Study protocol,NSF,# GEO1211668,National Science Foundation,,1211668

Understanding and acting on the link between weather and meningitis in the Sahel could help improve vaccinedistribution and save lives. People living there know that meningitis epidemics occur in the dry season and end after thestart of the rainy season. Integrating and analyzing newly available epidemiological and meteorological data quantifiedthis relationship, showing that that the risk of meningitis epidemics climbed from a background level of 2% to amaximum risk of 25% during the dry season. These data also suggested that, of all meteorological variables, relativehumidity has the strongest correlation to cases of meningitis.Weather acts alongside a complex set of environmental, social, and economic drivers, and a complementaryinvestigation of local and regional knowledge, attitudes, and practices suggested several additional interventions tomanage meningitis. These include improved awareness of early meningitis symptoms and vaccinations for farmworkerswho migrate seasonally. An economic survey showed that the cost of a single case of meningitis is 3 times the averageannual household income, underscoring the need for improved vaccination strategy.Using these insights, meteorologists and public health workers developed a tool to guide vaccination decisions. Iterativedevelopment allowed a multinational team of public health officials to use the tool while guiding its refinement anddirected research toward maximum practical use. That meant focusing on predicting areas where high humidity wouldnaturally end epidemics so vaccines could be moved elsewhere. Using this tool and this approach could have preventedan estimated 24,000 cases of meningitis over a 3-yr period.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60077597', 'afid': '60077597', 'affilname': 'Union of Concerned Scientists', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071890', 'afid': '60071890', 'affilname': 'Navrongo Health Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Navrongo', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071871', 'afid': '60071871', 'affilname': 'Ghana Health Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Accra', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021243', 'afid': '60021243', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017910', 'afid': '60017910', 'affilname': 'University of Ghana', 'affiliation-city': 'Legon', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015590', 'afid': '60015590', 'affilname': 'University Corporation for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006594', 'afid': '60006594', 'affilname': 'Pomona College', 'affiliation-city': 'Claremont', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100817516', 'afid': '100817516', 'affilname': 'Navrongo War Memorial Hospital', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}]",Journal,Review,"['Pandya R.', 'Hodgson A.', 'Hayden M.H.', 'Akweongo P.', 'Hopson T.', 'Forgor A.A.', 'Yoksas T.', 'Dalaba M.A.', 'Dukic V.', 'Mera R.', 'Dumont A.', 'McCormack K.', 'Anaseba D.', 'Awine T.', 'Boehnert J.', 'Nyaaba G.', 'Laing A.', 'Semazzi F.']","['7005038449', '7101639287', '9635846500', '6505902508', '6603621437', '9943428600', '6506255199', '55808843800', '8446677800', '15045401800', '56606775600', '56606884700', '55821731500', '23018171100', '37118434700', '55821200700', '8658853400', '35618283200']",,,undefined,Google,,1211668

Local perspectives on changing weather and climate and analyses of meteorological data represent two different but potentially complementary ways of knowing about the local-scale impacts of global climate change. This paper uses quantitative social survey data from the Kassena and Nankana Districts of Northern Ghana and the best available meteorological records to examine recent changes in weather patterns for this region. The most commonly mentioned changes perceived by respondents include changes in the timing or predictability of rains, and overall drier conditions. Both of these changes are corroborated by precipitation datasets: The onset of the peak rainy season has shifted progressively later over the past decade, by up to a month, and the rainy season has been drier over the past 3–5 years compared to the past 10–35 years, mainly due to lower rainfall during peak months (June and July). Many respondents also said that conditions had become windier, and we find that this perception varies spatially within the districts, but no meteorological data are available for this climate parameter in this region. The common perception that deforestation is responsible for observed changes in weather patterns is partly supported by Landsat imagery indicating a reduction in dense vegetation in recent decades. This comparison highlights some of the potential benefits and challenges involved in giving more voice to community perspectives in the co-production of knowledge on global climate change and its regional impacts.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071890', 'afid': '60071890', 'affilname': 'Navrongo Health Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Navrongo', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021243', 'afid': '60021243', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dickinson K.', 'Monaghan A.', 'Rivera I.', 'Hu L.', 'Kanyomse E.', 'Alirigia R.', 'Adoctor J.', 'Kaspar R.', 'Oduro A.', 'Wiedinmyer C.']","['26427583800', '7005133082', '56609945500', '55642592500', '56610396600', '56610265000', '56610393700', '56609953000', '57196872080', '6602352339']",Climate change | Ghana | Local impacts | Local knowledge | West Africa,EPA,8354201,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,,1211668

Anthropogenic pollution in Africa is dominated by diffuse and inefficient combustion sources, as electricity access is low and motorcycles and outdated cars proliferate. These sources are missing, out-of-date, or misrepresented in state-of-the-science emission inventories. We address these deficiencies with a detailed inventory of Diffuse and Inefficient Combustion Emissions in Africa (DICE-Africa) for 2006 and 2013. Fuelwood for energy is the largest emission source in DICE-Africa, but grows from 2006 to 2013 at a slower rate than charcoal production and use, and gasoline and diesel for motorcycles, cars, and generators. Only kerosene use and gas flaring decline. Increase in emissions from 2006 to 2013 in this work is consistent with trends in satellite observations of formaldehyde and NO2, but much slower than the explosive growth projected with a fuel consumption model. Seasonal biomass burning is considered a large pollution source in Africa, but we estimate comparable emissions of black carbon and higher emissions of nonmethane volatile organic compounds from DICE-Africa. Nitrogen oxide (NOx ≡ NO + NO2) emissions are much lower than from biomass burning. We use GEOS-Chem to estimate that the largest contribution of DICE-Africa to annual mean surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is >5 μg m-3 in populous Nigeria.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60077572', 'afid': '60077572', 'affilname': 'Harvard John A.

While transitioning to cleaner cooking technologies has the potential to generate significant health and environmental benefits, prior efforts to introduce improved cookstoves have encountered many hurdles. Here, we focus on the increased stove use hurdle; households tend to use improved stoves alongside their traditional stoves rather than replacing them entirely, a phenomenon called cookstove “stacking.” This work provides a systematic, multi-method assessment of households' cooking behaviors and cookstove stacking in the context of a 200-home randomized cookstove intervention study in Northern Ghana. Two stoves were selected for the intervention, a locally made rocket stove (Gyapa) and the Philips HD4012 LS gasifier stove. There were four intervention groups: a control group, a group given two Gyapa stoves, a group given two Philips stoves, and a group given one of each. Two stoves were distributed to each home in an attempt to induce more substitution away from traditional stoves. Adoption and usage patterns were quantified using temperature loggers at a subset of homes, as well as quarterly surveying in all households. We find that using multiple stoves each day is common practice within each intervention group, and that the two groups given at least one Gyapa had the largest reductions in traditional stove use relative to the control group, though use of traditional stoves remained high in all groups.",31,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071890', 'afid': '60071890', 'affilname': 'Navrongo Health Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Navrongo', 'affiliation-country': 'Ghana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117369616', 'afid': '117369616', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Science', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Piedrahita R.', 'Dickinson K.', 'Kanyomse E.', 'Coffey E.', 'Alirigia R.', 'Hagar Y.', 'Rivera I.', 'Oduro A.', 'Dukic V.', 'Wiedinmyer C.', 'Hannigan M.']","['36178445000', '26427583800', '56610396600', '56609988800', '56610265000', '26535969700', '56609945500', '57196872080', '8446677800', '6602352339', '7004176296']",,EPA,1211668,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0973082616302137,1211668

Current green infrastructure (GI) practice aims at mitigating the negative effects of urbanization by restoring pre-development hydrology and ultimately addressing water quality issues at an urban catchment scale. However, the benefits of GI extend well beyond local storm water management, as urban green spaces are also major contributors to human health. Considerable research in the psychological sciences have shown significant human health benefits from appropriately designed green spaces, yet impacts on human wellbeing have not yet been formally considered in GI design frameworks. This work develops a novel computational green infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates storm water management requirements with criteria for human wellbeing. A supervised machine-learning model is created to identify specific patterns in urban green spaces that promote human wellbeing; the model is linked to RHESSYS hydrological model to evaluate GI designs in terms of both water resource and human health benefits. An application of the framework to tree-based GI design in Dead Run Watershed, Baltimore, MD, shows that image-mining methods are able to capture key elements of human preferences that could improve GI design. The results also show that hydrologic benefits associated with tree-based features are substantial, indicating that increased urban tree coverage and a more integrated GI design approach can significantly increase both human and hydrologic benefits.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021918', 'afid': '60021918', 'affilname': 'University of Virginia', 'affiliation-city': 'Charlottesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017536', 'afid': '60017536', 'affilname': 'Southern Methodist University', 'affiliation-city': 'Dallas', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rai A.', 'Minsker B.', 'Sullivan W.', 'Band L.']","['57136232000', '57209020040', '7102599410', '7005637276']",Computer vision | Green stormwater infrastructure | Human preference | Hydrologic modeling | Machine learning,NSF,1216817,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1364815219300532,1615560

GI is conceptualized to improve water and ecosystem quality by reducing storm water runoff at the source, but when properly designed, may also benefit these expanded goals. With the increasing use of GI in urban contexts, there is an emerging need to facilitate participatory design and scenario evaluation to enable better communication between GI designers and groups impacted by these designs. Major barriers to this type of public participation is the complexity of both parameterizing, operating, visualizing and interpreting results of complex ecohydrological models at various watershed scales that are sufficient to address diverse ecosystem service goals. This paper demonstrates a set of workflows to facilitate rapid and repeatable creation of GI landscape designs which are incorporated into complex models using web applications and services.

The concept of ecological solidarity (ES) is a major feature of the 2006 law reforming national park policy in France. In the context of biodiversity conservation, the objectives of this study are to outline the historical development of ES, provide a working defi nition, and present a method for its implementation that combines environmental pragmatism and adaptive management. First, we highlight how ES provides a focus on the interdependencies among humans and nonhuman components of the socioecological system. In doing so, we identify ES within a framework that distinguishes ecological, socioecological, and sociopolitical interdependencies. In making such interdependencies apparent to humans who are not aware of their existence, the concept of ES promotes collective action as an alternative or complementary approach to state-or market-based approaches. By focusing on the awareness, feelings, and acknowledgement of interdependencies between actors and between humans and nonhumans, we present and discuss a learning-based approach (participatory modeling) that allows stakeholders to work together to construct cultural landscapes for present and future generations. Using two case studies, we show how an ES analysis goes beyond the ecosystem management approach to take into account how human interactions with the environment embody cultural, social, and economic values and endorse an ethically integrated science of care and responsibility. ES recognizes the diversity of these values as a practical foundation for socially engaged and accountable actions.

Over the last 10 years, citizen science has grown immensely in the United States and many other countries. Here, we show how citizen science is a powerful tool for tackling many of the challenges faced in the field of conservation biology. We describe the two interwoven paths by which citizen science can improve conservation efforts, natural resource management, and environmental protection. The first path includes building scientific knowledge, while the other path involves informing policy and encouraging public action. We explore how citizen science is currently used and describe the investments needed to create a citizen science program. We find that: 1. Citizen science already contributes substantially to many domains of science, including conservation, natural resource, and environmental science. Citizen science informs natural resource management, environmental protection, and policymaking and fosters public input and engagement.2. Many types of projects can benefit from citizen science, but one must be careful to match the needs for science and public involvement with the right type of citizen science project and the right method of public participation.3. Citizen science is a rigorous process of scientific discovery, indistinguishable from conventional science apart from the participation of volunteers.

Characterizing how variation in forest landscape structure shapes patterns of natural disturbances and mediates interactions between multiple disturbances is critical for anticipating ecological consequences of climate change in high-latitude forest ecosystems. During the 1990s, a massive spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak took place in boreal spruce forest on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska allowing us to ask (1) How did the extent and duration of bark beetle outbreak differ between a homogenous landscape dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca), and a landscape in which white spruce and black spruce (Picea mariana) were intermixed? (2) How has the occurrence and duration of bark beetle outbreak influenced the likelihood of subsequent burning in these two landscapes? Forest landscape structure had a substantial effect on disturbance patterns and interactions between disturbances in this study. The spruce bark beetle outbreak was smaller in extent and duration where white spruce, the beetle's primary host tree, was intermixed with more beetle-resistant black spruce. However, likelihood of subsequent burning increased where outbreak did occur. Surface fuel loads increased substantially in this landscape following the outbreak, potentially increasing the flammability of white spruce where they once served as fire breaks. In contrast, the outbreak was larger and lasted longer in the landscape with homogeneous stands of white spruce, but was not related to likelihood of subsequent burning, which is consistent with the fire history. Our results suggest that bark beetle outbreaks may have different effects on subsequent patterns of burning than in other systems, such as the Rocky Mountains. These results could inform more effective and targeted management strategies to ameliorate fire risk in beetle-killed stands of Alaska and may help us anticipate the dynamics and consequences of future boreal bark beetle outbreaks as climate warms at high latitudes.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022355', 'afid': '60022355', 'affilname': 'University of Montana', 'affiliation-city': 'Missoula', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hansen W.', 'Chapin F.', 'Naughton H.', 'Rupp T.', 'Verbyla D.']","['57203048622', '7007033191', '16417384300', '36191244500', '6603613527']",Climate change | Conifer forests | Landscape heterogeneity | Linked disturbance interactions | Natural disturbance | North American boreal forest,NSF,JFSP 12-1-07-1,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378112716301116,1518563

Despite hunter access influencing harvest success, few studies have quantified characteristics of hunter access. Based on spatially explicit interview data, we used geographic information system (GIS) analyses to calculate access pathways and distances that rural hunters traveled to moose (Alces alces) harvest locations in Interior Alaska. Using Jenks Natural Breaks classification, approximately 53%, 21%, 5%, and 21% of harvest locations occurred along navigable rivers within 0 to 24, 25 to 52, 53 to 86, and >86 km (0 to 14, 15 to 32, 33 to 53, and >53 mi), respectively, from the hunter’s community of residence. We used moose density estimates in the area being accessed by hunters to calculate annual moose harvest. Our results were similar to estimates from independent sources that used more standardized methods (e.g., agency household surveys). This suggests that our access-based approach has potential to provide an alternative method for estimating harvest intensity in areas where harvest report data are considered unreliable.

Two opposing narratives describe future prospects for mixed economic livelihoods in Alaska and the broader Arctic. On the one hand, Arctic anthropologists have written about the emergence of persistent mixed economies in Native communities. A second narrative echoes modernization assumptions and assumes that ""subsistence is dying,"" mixed economies are transitional, and Native communities are headed inevitably toward full market dependence. We provide evidence that mixed economies are not transitional. Mixed economies have three components: households engage in (1) market exchange, (2) subsistence activities, and (3) culturally embedded social relationships sustained by flows of wild food and other resources. Using household-level social network and economic data from two Iñupiat communities spanning 30 years, we explore hypotheses designed to test an assumed transition to market dependence. If transition assumptions hold, households with high engagement in the cash economy will have low engagement in subsistence production and diminished social relationships. Results do not support this narrative of change. Although there is considerable variability in household harvest, income, and social relationships, those highly engaged in market activities are also disproportionately involved in subsistence activities, sharing, and cooperation. Beyond broad narratives, an assessment of underlying processes and conditions supporting persistent mixed economies is warranted.",38,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029489', 'afid': '60029489', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Anchorage', 'affiliation-city': 'Anchorage', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Burnsilver S.', 'Magdanz J.', 'Stotts R.', 'Berman M.', 'Kofinas G.']","['10440289500', '56856760900', '55388911600', '7202661110', '6603718281']",Arctic | Cash economy | Mixed economies | Social networks | Subsistence hunting,NSF,ARC-0909570,National Science Foundation,,1518563

This article identifies opportunities and challenges to using sense of place as motivation for long-term stewardship at multiple spatial scales in a rapidly changing world. Sense of place reflects processes by which individuals or groups identify, attach to, depend on, and modify places, as well as the meanings, values, and feelings that individuals or groups associate with a place. These associations with place are fluid through time as they are felt, imagined, interpreted, and understood. Sense of place appears to most strongly motivate stewardship actions at local scales under circumstances where people value a place for the same reasons, and the conditions of the place are deteriorating. We suggest that well-recognized actions that build place attachment could create a reservoir of potential stewardship, if locally valued places were to deteriorate, as, for example, in response to climate change. Sense of place does not always promote stewardship, however, because attitudes may not lead to actions, some actions do not promote sustainability, and different place identities in the same place may lead to different stewardship goals (e.g., conservation vs. development). In situations where sense of place is deeply contested, we suggest that stewardship is best fostered by transparent and respectful dialogue to identify shared values and concerns and negotiate areas of disagreement. As a result of increased human mobility and globalization, individuals interact with many places to satisfy their desires and needs. We suggest that this opens new opportunities to motivate stewardship of types of places at regional, national, and global scales. Approaches such as discourse analysis, boundary concepts, incompletely theorized agreement, and common property theory that explicitly address contested concepts might contribute significantly to fostering sustainability in a rapidly changing and deeply divided world.",58,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007630', 'afid': '60007630', 'affilname': 'Western Colorado University', 'affiliation-city': 'Gunnison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chapin F.', 'Knapp C.']","['7007033191', '26323273600']",Globalization | Local-to-global scales | Sense of place | Stewardship | Sustainability,NSF,0654441,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1462901115000854,1518563

Ecosystem stewardship is a framework for actively shaping trajectories of ecological and social change to foster a more sustainable future for species, ecosystems, and society. We apply this framework to conservation challenges and opportunities in the Arctic, where the rapid pace of human-induced changes and their interactions force us now to consider a new relationship between people and the rest of nature. Biodiversity, which has traditionally been the target of conservation efforts, is increasingly affected by human impacts such as energy demand and industrial development that are motivated more by short-term profits than by concerns for societal consequences of long-term arctic biodiversity change. We posit that effective approaches to conservation must (a) foster both ecosystem resilience and human wellbeing, (b) integrate ecological and social processes across scales, and (c) take actions that shape the future rather than seeking only to restore the past. To this end, we identify progress through actions that have been or could be taken at local, national, and international scales to promote arctic resilience and conservation. A stewardship approach to conservation aims to prevent undesirable changes and prepares for adaptation to rapid and uncertain changes that cannot be avoided and for transformation to avoid or escape undesirable states. The greatest opportunity for arctic stewardship at the local scale may lie in building upon culturally engrained (often indigenous) respect for nature and reliance on local environment, empowering it through knowledge and power sharing with national regulatory frameworks. This, in turn, allows connection of drivers with impacts across scales and raises awareness of the value of human-environment relationships. At national and international scales stewardship provides rules for coordinated action to reconcile local and regional conservation actions with those that are motivated by constraints at the global level, to foster ecosystem integrity and human wellbeing in the face of transformative changes in environment, landscapes, species, and society.",29,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chapin F.', 'Sommerkorn M.', 'Robards M.', 'Hillmer-Pegram K.']","['7007033191', '6506911002', '7003388634', '55916668400']",Arctic | Climate change | Governance | Human wellbeing | Resource development | Stewardship,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S095937801530011X,1518563

Humans depend on services provided by ecosystems, and how services are affected by climate change is increasingly studied. Few studies, however, address changes likely to affect services from seminatural ecosystems. We analyzed ecosystem goods and services in natural and seminatural systems, specifically how they are expected to change as a result of projected climate change during the 21st century. We selected terrestrial and freshwater systems in northernmost Europe, where climate is anticipated to change more than the global average, and identified likely changes in ecosystem services and their societal consequences. We did this by assembling experts from ecology, social science, and cultural geography in workshops, and we also performed a literature review. Results show that most ecosystem services are affected by multiple factors, often acting in opposite directions. Out of 14 services considered, 8 are expected to increase or remain relatively unchanged in supply, and 6 are expected to decrease. Although we do not predict collapse or disappearance of any of the investigated services, the effects of climate change in conjunction with potential economical and societal changes may exceed the adaptive capacity of societies. This may result in societal reorganization and changes in ways that ecosystems are used. Significant uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the forecast make specific conclusions about societal responses to safeguard human well-being questionable. Adapting to changes in ecosystem services will therefore require consideration of uncertainties and complexities in both social and ecological responses. The scenarios presented here provide a framework for future studies exploring such issues.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108626', 'afid': '60108626', 'affilname': 'The Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research', 'affiliation-city': 'As', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106157', 'afid': '60106157', 'affilname': 'Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)', 'affiliation-city': 'Helsinki', 'affiliation-country': 'Finland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104983', 'afid': '60104983', 'affilname': 'Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Moscow', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031040', 'afid': '60031040', 'affilname': 'Umeå Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Umea', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024826', 'afid': '60024826', 'affilname': 'Cicero Senter for klimaforskning', 'affiliation-city': 'Oslo', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022673', 'afid': '60022673', 'affilname': 'Nordlands Forskning', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodo', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021255', 'afid': '60021255', 'affilname': 'UiT The Arctic University of Norway', 'affiliation-city': 'Tromso', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016896', 'afid': '60016896', 'affilname': 'Tomsk State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tomsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011282', 'afid': '60011282', 'affilname': 'Vestlandsforsking', 'affiliation-city': 'Sogndal', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002952', 'afid': '60002952', 'affilname': 'Helsingin Yliopisto', 'affiliation-city': 'Helsinki', 'affiliation-country': 'Finland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881', 'afid': '60001881', 'affilname': 'University of Sheffield', 'affiliation-city': 'Sheffield', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

All rights reserved. Fire severity is an important control over regeneration of deciduous species and can influence the overall quality of habitat for herbivores, such as moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)), but the relationships between availability and duration of biomass production and moose habitat use are largely unknown. We evaluate the relative influence of a regenerating burn, paying particular attention to fire severity, on winter forage production and duration, offtake, nutritional quality, and seasonal moose habitat use. We used data from 14 GPS collared male moose in the 20-year-old Hajdukovich Creek Burn (HCB) in interior Alaska, USA, to generate seasonal dynamic Brownian bridge movement models. Within HCB, moose selected for low-severity sites more than high- and moderate-severity sites during the winter. Over the past decade, willow (species of the genus Salix L.) biomass production in low-severity sites has doubled and is likely influencing winter habitat selection patterns. In summer, moose selected for high-severity sites where there is a more abundant understory layer (e.g., stem densities) providing both forage and cover. The initial pulse of biomass production in high-severity sites, as well as the delay in growth and maturation of vegetation in low-severity sites, indicate that differing distributions of wildfire severity can create a dynamic mosaic of habitat patches that may extend the value of burns over time for moose.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010352', 'afid': '60010352', 'affilname': 'Alaska Department of Game and Fisheries', 'affiliation-city': 'Juneau', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Brown C.', 'Kielland K.', 'Euskirchen E.', 'Brinkman T.', 'Ruess R.', 'Kellie K.']","['55478136800', '6603892842', '8523958300', '7006060239', '7003306568', '24481237100']",Alces alces | Biomass | Fire severity | Landscape heterogeneity | Moose | Nutritional quality | Space use,NSF,0654441,National Science Foundation,,1518563

Many rural communities are increasingly relying on off-road motorized vehicles to access wildlife for both subsistence harvest and recreational hunting. Understanding the effects of trail and road networks on wildlife behavior is crucial to effective management for subsistence opportunities in communities that depend on accessible populations as an ecosystem service. We collared 26 adult male moose (Alces alces) in interior Alaska to monitor fine-scale habitat selection and movement patterns before, during, and after the hunting season in relation to trail and habitat characteristics. Moose response varied by region and the associated distribution of regional hunter trails (e.g., trails and secondary roads). Moose that resided in areas with extensive trail access selected habitat closer to trails and vegetative cover. Additionally, moose step length increased as distance to cover increased. Moose in more remote, less accessible regions avoided areas with high trail densities and selected habitat closer to quality forage during the hunting season. Moose step lengths also increased with higher densities of trails. Our research suggests that landscape-level hunter access can affect patterns of male moose movement and habitat selection to avoid risk during the hunting season. Our models provide an innovative approach to examining the spatio-temporal variation of behavioral responses to habitat and landscape features and can serve as a framework for managers to better understand the relationships between human disturbance during the hunting season and wildlife management and conservation.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033389', 'afid': '60033389', 'affilname': 'University of Idaho', 'affiliation-city': 'Moscow', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Brown C.', 'Kielland K.', 'Brinkman T.', 'Gilbert S.', 'Euskirchen E.']","['55478136800', '6603892842', '7006060239', '56503054800', '8523958300']",all-terrain vehicle | habitat use | hunting | road density,NSF,0654441,National Science Foundation,,1518563

Subsistence harvesters in high latitudes rely on frozen rivers for winter access to local resources. During recent decades, interior Alaskan residents have observed changes in river ice regimes that are significant hindrances to travel and subsistence practices. We used remote sensing in combination with local observations to examine changes in seasonality of river breakup and freeze-up and to assess the implications on travel for subsistence harvesters. Spring and autumn air temperatures, respectively, were found to impact timing of breakup (22.0 days 8C21) and freeze-up (12.0 days 8C21). Spring air temperatures have increased by 0.28–0.68C decade21 over the last 62–93 years, depending on study area and time period. Local observations indicate that the breakup season has advanced by about 6 days over the last century. Autumn air temperatures have not changed over the long term, but have been generally warmer over the last 15 years.

The Mesoamerican and Caribbean (MAC) region is characterized by tropical cyclones (TCs), strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation events, and climate variability that bring unique hazards to socio-ecological systems. Here we report the first characterization of the isotopic evolution of a TC (Hurricane Otto, 2016) in the MAC region. We use long-term daily rainfall isotopes from Costa Rica and event-based sampling of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2017), to underpin the dynamical drivers of TC isotope ratios. During Hurricane Otto, rainfall exhibited a large isotopic range, comparable to the annual isotopic cycle. As Hurricane Otto organized into a Category 3, rapid isotopic depletion coupled with a decrease in d-excess indicates efficient isotopic fractionation within ~200 km SW of the warm core. Our results shed light on key processes governing rainfall isotope ratios in the MAC region during continental and maritime TC tracks, with applications to the interpretation of paleo-hydroclimate across the tropics.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60086408', 'afid': '60086408', 'affilname': 'Centro de Estudios Ambientales de Cienfuegos', 'affiliation-city': 'Cienfuegos', 'affiliation-country': 'Cuba'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072840', 'afid': '60072840', 'affilname': 'University of the Bahamas', 'affiliation-city': 'Nassau', 'affiliation-country': 'Bahamas'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071929', 'afid': '60071929', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Costa Rica', 'affiliation-city': 'San Jose', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071924', 'afid': '60071924', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica', 'affiliation-city': 'Heredia', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032543', 'afid': '60032543', 'affilname': 'Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019647', 'afid': '60019647', 'affilname': 'Georgia Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Atlanta', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018208', 'afid': '60018208', 'affilname': 'Washington State University Pullman', 'affiliation-city': 'Pullman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015875', 'afid': '60015875', 'affilname': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliation-city': 'Aberdeen', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000762', 'afid': '60000762', 'affilname': 'Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000264', 'afid': '60000264', 'affilname': 'Nagoya University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nagoya', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sánchez-Murillo R.', 'Durán-Quesada A.M.', 'Esquivel-Hernández G.', 'Rojas-Cantillano D.', 'Birkel C.', 'Welsh K.', 'Sánchez-Llull M.', 'Alonso-Hernández C.M.', 'Tetzlaff D.', 'Soulsby C.', 'Boll J.', 'Kurita N.', 'Cobb K.M.']","['56096709800', '35777594300', '55319904200', '57201428368', '35753078100', '56844825800', '57192435261', '6508025438', '9038954000', '7005620600', '7003953421', '7004462660', '7004707500']",,IAEA,COS7005,International Atomic Energy Agency,,1826709

Urban landscapes can be transformed by widespread abandonment from population andeconomic decline. Ecological assembly, sometimes referred to as ""greening"", following abandonmentcan yield valuable ecosystem services, but also can pose a risk to public health. Abandonment canelevate zoonotic vector-borne disease risk by favoring the hyperabundance of commensal pests andpathogen vectors. Though greater biodiversity in abandoned areas can potentially dilute vector-bornepathogen transmission, ""greening"" can elevate transmission risk by increasing movement of pathogenvectors between fragmented areas and by giving rise to novel human-wildlife interfaces. Idled andderelict infrastructure can further elevate disease risk from vector-borne and water-borne pathogens,which can build up in stagnant and unprotected water that maintenance and routine use of delivery orsanitation systems would otherwise eliminate. Thus, framing ""greening"" as inherently positive couldresult in policies and actions that unintentionally exacerbate inequalities by elevating risks ratherthan delivering benefits. As counter-urbanism is neither a minor pattern of urban development, nora short-term departure from urban growth, homeowner and municipal management of abandonedareas should account for potential hazards to reduce health risks. Further socioecological assessmentsof public health risks following abandonment could better ensure the resilience and well-being ofcommunities in shrinking cities.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015112', 'afid': '60015112', 'affilname': 'Tulane University School of Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gulachenski A.', 'Ghersi B.', 'Lesen A.', 'Blum M.']","['57189445631', '26649833600', '8665312900', '7202379952']",Biodiversity | Coupled natural human ecosystem dynamics | Dilution effect | Ecosystem services | Emerging infectious disease | Environmental justice,NSF,BCS-1313703,National Science Foundation,,1313703

The concept of touristic disaster views disaster-devastated neighborhoods as sites and arenas of contestation in which opposing groups and interests battle to control representations of urban space.

Despite growing interest in urban resilience, remarkably little is known about vegetation dynamics in the aftermath of disasters. In this study, we examined the composition and structure of plant communities across New Orleans (Louisiana, USA) following catastrophic flooding triggered by levee failures during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Focusing on eight neighborhoods that span a range of demographic and topographical conditions, we assessed whether plant communities in post-Katrina New Orleans reflect flooding disturbance and post-disaster landscape management policies. We then contextualized vegetation patterns and associated ecosystem services and disservices with census-based demographic trends and in-depth interviews to draw inferences about the drivers and outcomes of urban land abandonment in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. We found that areas subject to the greatest flooding disturbance exhibit the highest rates of vegetation response. Disturbance intensity and elevation, however, are relatively weak drivers of vegetation differences among the studied neighborhoods. Rather, we found that household income, racial demographics, and land abandonment are important drivers of vegetation community composition and structure across the city. Our findings indicate that resettlement and landscape management policies can mediate post-flooding ecological outcomes and demonstrate that unmanaged, emergent vegetation on abandoned lands can be an environmental justice concern in underserved and historically marginalized communities.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015112', 'afid': '60015112', 'affilname': 'Tulane University School of Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003771', 'afid': '60003771', 'affilname': 'University of Manchester', 'affiliation-city': 'Manchester', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002014', 'afid': '60002014', 'affilname': 'The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lewis J.', 'Zipperer W.', 'Ernstson H.', 'Bernik B.', 'Hazen R.', 'Elmqvist T.', 'Blum M.']","['56911456800', '6601983543', '14037318900', '56584560000', '36499271000', '6701768312', '7202379952']",Abandonment | Disturbance | Environmental justice | Resilience | Urban ecology | Vegetation,NSF,BCS-1313703,National Science Foundation,,1313703

It is becoming increasingly likely that rodents will drive future disease epidemics with the continued expansion of cities worldwide. Though transmission risk is a growing concern, relatively little is known about pathogens carried by urban rats. Here, we assess whether the diversity and prevalence of Bartonella bacteria differ according to the (co)occurrence of rat hosts across New Orleans, LA (NO), where both Norway (Rattus norvegicus) and roof rats (Rattus rattus) are found, relative to New York City (NYC) which only harbors Norway rats. We detected human pathogenic Bartonella species in both NYC and New Orleans rodents. We found that Norway rats in New Orleans harbored a more diverse assemblage of Bartonella than Norway rats in NYC and that Norway rats harbored a more diverse and distinct assemblage of Bartonella compared to roof rats in New Orleans. Additionally, Norway rats were more likely to be infected with Bartonella than roof rats in New Orleans. Flea infestation appears to be an important predictor of Bartonella infection in Norway rats across both cities.

All rights reserved. Native to China and Mongolia, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) now enjoys a worldwide distribution. While black rats and the house mouse tracked the regional development of human agricultural settlements, brown rats did not appear in Europe until the 1500s, suggesting their range expansion was a response to relatively recent increases in global trade. We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32 k SNPs, and detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent rapid colonization of Africa, the Americas and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected. An astonishing degree of fine-grained clustering between and within sampling sites underscored the extent to which urban heterogeneity shaped genetic structure of commensal rodents. Surprisingly, few individuals were recent migrants, suggesting that recruitment into established populations is limited.

All rights reserved. Urbanization often substantially influences animal movement and gene flow. However, few studies to date have examined gene flow of the same species across multiple cities. In this study, we examine brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) to test hypotheses about the repeatability of neutral evolution across four cities: Salvador, Brazil; New Orleans, USA; Vancouver, Canada; and New York City, USA. At least 150 rats were sampled from each city and genotyped for a minimum of 15 000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of genome-wide diversity were similar across cities, but varied across neighbourhoods within cities. All four populations exhibited high spatial autocorrelation at the shortest distance classes (less than 500 m) owing to limited dispersal. Coancestry and evolutionary clustering analyses identified genetic discontinuities within each city that coincided with a resource desert in New York City, major waterways in New Orleans, and roads in Salvador and Vancouver. Such replicated studies are crucial to assessing the generality of predictions from urban evolution, and have practical applications for pest management and public health. Future studies should include a range of global cities in different biomes, incorporate multiple species, and examine the impact of specific characteristics of the built environment and human socioeconomics on gene flow.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030589', 'afid': '60030589', 'affilname': 'Providence College', 'affiliation-city': 'Providence', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026004', 'afid': '60026004', 'affilname': 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015186', 'afid': '60015186', 'affilname': 'University of Saskatchewan', 'affiliation-city': 'Saskatoon', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015095', 'afid': '60015095', 'affilname': 'Fordham University', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013710', 'afid': '60013710', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal da Bahia', 'affiliation-city': 'Salvador', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010365', 'afid': '60010365', 'affilname': 'The University of British Columbia', 'affiliation-city': 'Vancouver', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Combs M.', 'Byers K.', 'Ghersi B.', 'Blum M.', 'Caccone A.', 'Costa F.', 'Himsworth C.', 'Richardson J.', 'Munshi-South J.']","['57191832387', '55389174800', '26649833600', '7202379952', '7003512116', '55378617300', '24075796500', '57198276220', '56089114300']",Brown rats | Coancestry | Genetic diversity | Population genomics | Spatial autocorrelation | Urban evolution,NSERC,102330/Z/13/Z,Wellcome Trust,,1313703

Findings suggest that respondents judge the level of flood risk to be lower than other types of risk. Results from ordinal logistic regression analyses show that flood risk perception is influenced by flood experience, income, race, gender, homeownership status, and years residing in New Orleans. Our findings support extant scholarship showing that African Americans tend to have higher perceptions of risk than whites and that low-income people and women have higher risk perceptions than higher income residents and men.

We explored the nature of T. cruzi infection in small rodents from New Orleans (LA, USA), an enzootic region of the parasite in North America. Methods: We characterized the full complement of discrete typing units (DTUs) in rodent hosts through next-generation metabarcoding, as conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing approaches only detect the dominant genotype in biological samples. We assayed DTU diversity in tissue samples from 6 T. cruzi PCR positive rodents. The intergenic region of the mini-exon gene was amplified and sequenced on a MiSeq platform. A total of 141 sequences were aligned using Muscle, and TCS networks were constructed to identify DTUs in the samples. Results: We detected distinct and varying assemblages of DTUs in the rodent hosts. Highly diverse DTU assemblages were detected, with 6–32 haplotypes recovered per individual, spanning multiple DTUs (TcI,TcII, TcIV, TcV and TcVI). Haplotypes varied in frequencies from 82% to less than 0.1%. DTU composition varied according to the tissue analyzed. Rural and urban rodents carried similarly diverse DTU assemblages, though urban rodent species tended to harbor more haplotypes than their sylvatic counterparts. Conclusion: Our results affirm that mammalian hosts can concurrently harbor a diverse complement of parasites, and indicate that there is greater diversity of T. cruzi DTUs present in North America than previously thought. Further investigation is warranted to understand the role of commensal rodents as a reservoir for T. cruzi in sylvatic and peridomestic environments.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021134', 'afid': '60021134', 'affilname': 'Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015574', 'afid': '60015574', 'affilname': 'The University of Tennessee, Knoxville', 'affiliation-city': 'Knoxville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,,"['Pronovost H.', 'Peterson A.', 'Chavez B.', 'Blum M.', 'Dumonteil E.', 'Herrera C.']","['57205573893', '23994346000', '57205574676', '7202379952', '6701807761', '16401364900']",Chagas disease | Public health | Rodents | Sequencing | Trypanosoma cruzi,NSF,BCS-1313703,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1684118218300975,1313703

Animal movement, whether for foraging, mate-seeking, predator avoidance, dispersal, or migration, is a fundamental aspect of ecology that shapes spatial abundance distributions, genetic compositions, and dynamics of populations. A variety of movement models have been used for predicting the effects of natural or human-caused landscape changes, invading species, or other disturbances on local ecology. Here we introduce the flow network—a general modeling framework for population dynamics and movement in a metapopulation representing a network of habitat sites (nodes). Based on the principles of physical transport phenomena such as fluid flow through pipes (Pouiselle’s Law) and analogously, the flow of electric current across a circuit (Ohm’s Law), the flow network provides a novel way of modeling movement, where flow rates are functions of relative node pressures and the resistance to movement between them. Flow networks offer the flexibility of incorporating abiotic and biotic conditions that affect either pressures, resistance, or both. To illustrate an application of the flow network, we present a theoretical invasion scenario. We consider the effects of spatial structure on the speed of invasion by varying the spatial regularity of node arrangement. In the context of invasion, we model management actions targeting nodes or edges, and consider the effects on speed of invasion, node occupation, and total abundance. The flow network approach offers the flexibility to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in both rates of flow and site pressures and offers an intuitive approach to connecting population dynamics and landscape features to model movement.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rael R.', 'Taylor C.']","['55445590200', '7404822347']",Dispersal | Landscape modeling | Metapopulations | Migration | Migratory flow network | Source-sink dynamics,NSF,BCS-1313703,National Science Foundation,,1313703

We assessed the distribution, prevalence, and intensity of A. cantonensis infection in New Orleans by examining lung biopsy samples of rodents trapped at 96 sites in 9 areas in Orleans Parish and 1 area in neighboring St. Bernard Parish during May 2015 through February 2017. These areas were selected to capture contrasting levels of income, flooding, and post-disaster landscape management after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We detected A. cantonensis in all areas and in 3 of the 4 rat species trapped. Overall prevalence was ≈38% but varied by area, host species, and host species co-occurrence.

The paper focuses on several predictors including subjective flood risk perception, trust in government officials, sociodemographic characteristics, and experience with flood damage. Using binary logistic regression, the results show that the likelihood of having flood insurance coverage is associated with past flood damage and socioeconomic status. Older people (over age 65) are more likely to have flood insurance than younger residents. Race, gender, trust, and perceived flood risk are not statistically significant predictors of flood insurance. We connect our findings to the paradoxes and conflictual dynamics of flood insurance, a major risk mitigation measure.

About 20 million rural Bangladeshis continue to drink well water containing >50 μg/L arsenic (As). This analysis argues for reprioritizing interventions on the basis of a survey of wells serving a population of 380,000 conducted one decade after a previous round of testing overseen by the government. The available data indicate that testing alone reduced the exposed population in the area in the short term by about 130,000 by identifying the subset of low As wells that could be shared at a total cost of <US1 per person whose exposure was reduced. Testing also had a longer term impact, as 60,000 exposed inhabitants lowered their exposure by installing new wells to tap intermediate (45-90 m) aquifers that are low in As at their own expense of US30 per person whose exposure was reduced. In contrast, the installation of over 900 deep (>150 m) wells and a single piped-water supply system by the government reduced exposure of little more than 7000 inhabitants at a cost of US150 per person whose exposure was reduced.

Rice is the primary crop in Bangladesh, and rice yield is diminished due to the buildup of arsenic (As) in soil from irrigation with high-As groundwater. Implementing a soil inversion, where deeper low-As soil is exchanged with the surface high-As soil in contact with rice roots, may mitigate the negative impacts of As on yield. We compared soil As, soil nutrients, and rice yield in control plots with those in adjacent soil inversion plots. We also estimated the quantity of soil As deposited on a yearly basis via irrigation water, to explore the longevity of a soil inversion to reduce surface As. Soil As, organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations decreased by about 40% in response to the inversion and remained lowered over four seasons of monitoring. Inversion plot yields increased above control plot yields by 15-30% after a one-season lag despite the recovering but still reduced nutrient levels. Farmers have started conducting soil inversions of their own volition, typically close to where irrigation water enters the field. However, the yield gain will be limited to a few decades at most due to deposition of As via well water, unless the field is irrigated with low-As river or pond water.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033011', 'afid': '60033011', 'affilname': 'Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory', 'affiliation-city': 'Palisades', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195', 'afid': '60022195', 'affilname': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014714', 'afid': '60014714', 'affilname': 'University of Dhaka', 'affiliation-city': 'Dhaka', 'affiliation-country': 'Bangladesh'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Huhmann B.', 'Harvey C.', 'Uddin A.', 'Choudhury I.', 'Ahmed K.', 'Duxbury J.', 'Ellis T.', 'Van Geen A.']","['45961102600', '7202113812', '7003509329', '54406606100', '56243347100', '7006587968', '57188559129', '7003938156']",,NIEHS,P42 ES010349,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,,1414131

Invasive forest insect and pathogens (FIP) are having significant, direct, adverse impacts. Interactions between FIPs and forest owners have the potential to create ecosystem impacts that compound direct impacts. We assessed family forest owners' responses to numerous contingent behavior, FIP-outbreak scenarios in the northeastern USA based on FIP outbreak attributes. The survey was divided into four versions and each respondent was given four hypothetical scenarios and asked to gauge their certainty of each response. Sixty-eight percent of the hypothetical scenario responses (n = 2752) indicated an intent to harvest as a result of FIPs, and 49% indicated this intent with certainty. Eighty-four percent of respondents (n = 688) would consider harvesting for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios presented, and 67% of respondents were certain of their intent to harvest for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios. Harvest intention increased with greater FIP-related tree mortality and decreased with delayed total tree mortality. Owners with larger holdings, who had previously harvested forest products, and live on their forestland had greater intentions to harvest in response to FIPs. Results suggest that FIPs could transform the regional harvest regime with socio-ecological impacts that are distinct from those caused by FIPs or harvesting alone.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014313', 'afid': '60014313', 'affilname': 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'affiliation-city': 'Amherst MA', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007624', 'afid': '60007624', 'affilname': 'Harvard Forest', 'affiliation-city': 'Petersham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100563406', 'afid': '100563406', 'affilname': 'New England Conservatory', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Markowski-Lindsay M.', 'Borsuk M.', 'Butler B.', 'Duveneck M.', 'Holt J.', 'Kittredge D.', 'Laflower D.', 'MacLean M.', 'Orwig D.', 'Thompson J.']","['48461657600', '6603669002', '7202035518', '27067752700', '57210997254', '7003886116', '55839496500', '57213675586', '7003826192', '55492716300']",Contingent behavior | Coupled natural-human system | Family forest owner | Forest disturbance | Indirect effects | Land use | Timber harvesting,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0921800919307104,1617075

Changes in productivity of particular fisheries might be expected to lead not only to direct impacts within a fishery but to economic and ecological effects on other fisheries if there is substantial cross-participation by fishers. We use data from the US West Coast salmon troll fishery before, during, and after a large-scale closure to illustrate how altered resource availability influences the behaviour of fishing vessels in heterogeneous ways. We find that vessels were less likely to participate in fishing of any type during the closure, with >40% of vessels ceasing fishing temporarily and 17% exiting permanently. Vessels that were more dependent on salmon were more likely to cease fishing while more diversified vessels were more likely to continue. In spite of a high level of cross-participation, we find limited evidence that vessels increased their participation in other fisheries to offset lost salmon revenue. Ports that obtained more of their revenue from salmon troll vessels saw larger decreases in their revenue during the closure. Ocean conditions from 2013 to 2015 suggest the possibility of another highly restricted salmon fishing season in 2017. Our models predict that such restrictions would cause another economic disaster and lead to a large fraction of vessels exiting fishing but suggest that effects on fisheries linked by cross-participation are likely to be low.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020873', 'afid': '60020873', 'affilname': 'NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Northwest Regional Office', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003723', 'afid': '60003723', 'affilname': 'NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Richerson K.', 'Holland D.']","['35094339900', '7202290078']",California Current | climate variability | cross-participation | fisheries management | fishery closure | fishing behaviour | income diversification | salmon,NSF,1616821,National Science Foundation,,1616821

In the ocean, most estimates suggesting short-distance dispersal are based on direct ecological observations of dispersing individuals, while indirect evolutionary estimates often suggest substantially greater homogeneity among populations. Reconciling these two approaches and their seemingly competing perspectives on dispersal has been a major challenge. Here we show for the first time that evolutionary and ecological measures of larval dispersal can closely agree by using both to estimate the distribution of dispersal distances. In orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula) populations in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, we found that evolutionary dispersal kernels were 17 km (95% confidence interval: 12–24 km) wide, while an exhaustive set of direct larval dispersal observations suggested kernel widths of 27 km (19–36 km) or 19 km (15–27 km) across two years. The similarity between these two approaches suggests that ecological and evolutionary dispersal kernels can be equivalent, and that the apparent disagreement between direct and indirect measurements can be overcome. Our results suggest that carefully applied evolutionary methods, which are often less expensive, can be broadly relevant for understanding ecological dispersal across the tree of life.",22,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092945', 'afid': '60092945', 'affilname': 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Jeddah', 'affiliation-country': 'Saudi Arabia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027946', 'afid': '60027946', 'affilname': 'École Pratique des Hautes Etudes', 'affiliation-city': 'Paris', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026553', 'afid': '60026553', 'affilname': 'University of Melbourne', 'affiliation-city': 'Parkville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013609', 'afid': '60013609', 'affilname': 'Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008134', 'afid': '60008134', 'affilname': 'CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique', 'affiliation-city': 'Paris', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003634', 'afid': '60003634', 'affilname': 'Universidad Austral de Chile', 'affiliation-city': 'Valdivia', 'affiliation-country': 'Chile'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pinsky M.L.', 'Saenz-Agudelo P.', 'Salles O.C.', 'Almany G.R.', 'Bode M.', 'Berumen M.L.', 'Andréfouët S.', 'Thorrold S.R.', 'Jones G.P.', 'Planes S.']","['8608637700', '26429945900', '56968200100', '6602955917', '35304736900', '8632427600', '57204298997', '6701692965', '7406140483', '7004574648']",connectivity | coral reef | isolation by distance | larvae | metapopulation | Papua New Guinea | population genetics | reef fish,DOD,OCE-1430218,Alfred P.

One approach to understand community change in response to climate change has been to characterize communities by a collective thermal preference, or community temperature index (CTI), and then to compare changes in CTI with changes in temperature. However, important questions remain about whether and how responsive communities are to changes in their local thermal environments. We used CTI to analyze changes in 160 marine assemblages (fish and invertebrates) across the rapidly-changing Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem and calculated expected community change based on historical relationships between species presence and temperature from a separate training dataset. We then compared interannual and long-term temperature changes with expected community responses and observed community responses over both temporal scales. For these marine communities, we found that community composition as well as composition changes through time could be explained by species associations with bottom temperature. Individual species had non-linear responses to changes in temperature, and these nonlinearities scaled up to a nonlinear relationship between CTI and temperature. On average, CTI increased by 0.36°C (95% CI: 0.34–0.38°C) for every 1°C increase in bottom temperature, but the relationship between CTI and temperature also depended on community composition. In addition, communities responded more strongly to interannual variation than to long-term trends in temperature. We recommend that future research into climate-driven community change accounts for nonlinear responses and examines ecological responses across a range of temporal and geographical scales.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Flanagan P.', 'Jensen O.', 'Morley J.', 'Pinsky M.']","['57204616261', '9242529900', '16242198000', '8608637700']",climate change | community assembly | marine ecology,NSF,-1426891,National Science Foundation,,1616821

Understanding which species and ecosystems will be most severely affected by warming as climate change advances is important for guiding conservation and management. Both marine and terrestrial fauna have been affected by warming1,2 but an explicit comparison of physiological sensitivity between the marine and terrestrial realms has been lacking. Assessing how close populations live to their upper thermal limits has been challenging, in part because extreme temperatures frequently drive demographic responses3,4 and yet fauna can use local thermal refugia to avoid extremes5–7. Here we show that marine ectotherms experience hourly body temperatures that are closer to their upper thermal limits than do terrestrial ectotherms across all latitudes—but that this is the case only if terrestrial species can access thermal refugia. Although not a direct prediction of population decline, this thermal safety margin provides an index of the physiological stress caused by warming. On land, the smallest thermal safety margins were found for species at mid-latitudes where the hottest hourly body temperatures occurred; by contrast, the marine species with the smallest thermal safety margins were found near the equator. We also found that local extirpations related to warming have been twice as common in the ocean as on land, which is consistent with the smaller thermal safety margins at sea. Our results suggest that different processes will exacerbate thermal vulnerability across these two realms. Higher sensitivities to warming and faster rates of colonization in the marine realm suggest that extirpations will be more frequent and species turnover faster in the ocean. By contrast, terrestrial species appear to be more vulnerable to loss of access to thermal refugia, which would make habitat fragmentation and changes in land use critical drivers of species loss on land.",46,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010348', 'afid': '60010348', 'affilname': 'Universitetet i Oslo', 'affiliation-city': 'Oslo', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pinsky M.L.', 'Eikeset A.M.', 'McCauley D.J.', 'Payne J.L.', 'Sunday J.M.']","['8608637700', '16063420700', '14424362300', '7403333496', '22942195700']",,,undefined,,,1616821

Global richness is declining, but it is unclear whether sub-global trends differ. Regional trends are especially understudied, with most focused on island regions where richness is strongly impacted by novel colonisations. We addressed this knowledge gap by testing for multi-decade trends in species richness in nine open marine regions around North America (197 region-years) while accounting for imperfect observations and grounding our findings in species-level range dynamics. We found positive richness trends in eight of nine regions, four of which were statistically significant. Species' range sizes generally contracted pre-extinction and expanded post-colonisation, but the ranges of transient species expanded over the long-term, slowly increasing their regional retention and driving increasing richness. These results provide more evidence that sub-global richness trends are stable or increasing, and highlight the utility of range size for understanding richness dynamics.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Batt R.', 'Morley J.', 'Selden R.', 'Tingley M.', 'Pinsky M.']","['41561042000', '16242198000', '26030101100', '6603131569', '8608637700']",Bottom trawl | detectability | marine | MSOM | occupancy | range size | regional | species distribution | species richness | time series,NSF,-1521565,NordForsk,,1616821

These closures can have serious consequences for fishers and fishing communities, and have necessitated the release of millions of dollars of federal disaster aid. The 2017 ocean Chinook troll fishery (the major salmon ocean fishery) is closed between southern Oregon and northern California to protect the Klamath River fall Chinook, which is forecast to return in low numbers. A model of vessel fishing choices was used in combination with an established input-output model to estimate the potential economic impact of this closure on fishers and fishing communities. The analysis predicts that this closure of the ocean fishery will result in a loss of $5.8–$8.9 million in income, $12.8–$19.6 million in sales, and 200–330 jobs. These estimates are only a partial estimate of the economic impacts of the 2017 salmon regulations, as they do not fully account for the effects of the limited season outside of the closed ocean area or the effects on other salmon fisheries (e.g. the gillnet and recreational fisheries). The impacts are not distributed evenly in space, with the largest relative losses occurring in the Coos Bay, Brookings, and Eureka regions. This information may be useful as policymakers consider mitigating economic losses in the fishery and associated communities. Early estimates of economic impacts of fishery closures may also enable quicker determination of the need and extent of disaster assistance and a more timely response.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003723', 'afid': '60003723', 'affilname': 'NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Richerson K.', 'Leonard J.', 'Holland D.']","['35094339900', '56262451400', '7202290078']",California Current | Economic impacts | Fishery closure | Fishery disaster | Fishing behavior | Input-output model | Salmon fishery,NSF,1616821,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0308597X17306668,1616821

All rights reserved. Understanding why some renewable resources are overharvested while others are conserved remains an important challenge. Most explanations focus on institutional or ecological differences among resources. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that conservation and overharvest can be alternative stable states within the same exclusive-resource management system because of path-dependent processes, including slow institutional adaptation. Surprisingly, this theory predicts that the alternative states of strong conservation or overharvest are most likely for resources that were previously thought to be easily conserved under optimal management or even open access. Quantitative analyses of harvest rates from 217 intensely managed fisheries supports the predictions. Fisheries’ harvest rates also showed transient dynamics characteristic of path dependence, as well as convergence to the alternative stable state after unexpected transitions. This statistical evidence for path dependence differs from previous empirical support that was based largely on case studies, experiments, and distributional analyses. Alternative stable states in conservation appear likely outcomes for many cooperatively managed renewable resources, which implies that achieving conservation outcomes hinges on harnessing existing policy tools to navigate transitions.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849', 'afid': '60016849', 'affilname': 'University of Toronto', 'affiliation-city': 'Toronto', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Tekwa E.', 'Fenichel E.', 'Levin S.', 'Pinsky M.']","['56698256500', '9335127600', '26643470900', '8608637700']",Alternative stable states | Conservation | Fishery | Institution | Path dependence,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1616821

These shifts in distribution have already posed challenges for living marine resource management, and there is a strong need for projections of how species might be impacted by future changes in ocean temperatures during the 21st century. We modeled thermal habitat for 686 marine species in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans using long-term ecological survey data from the North American continental shelves. These habitat models were coupled to output from sixteen general circulation models that were run under high (RCP 8.5) and low (RCP 2.6) future greenhouse gas emission scenarios over the 21st century to produce 32 possible future outcomes for each species. The models generally agreed on the magnitude and direction of future shifts for some species (448 or 429 under RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6, respectively), but strongly disagreed for other species (116 or 120 respectively). This allowed us to identify species with more or less robust predictions. Future shifts in species distributions were generally poleward and followed the coastline, but also varied among regions and species. Species from the U.S. and Canadian west coast including the Gulf of Alaska had the highest projected magnitude shifts in distribution, and many species shifted more than 1000 km under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Following a strong mitigation scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement would likely produce substantially smaller shifts and less disruption to marine management efforts.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Using energetics-based formulations for wave-driven sediment transport, we develop a robust methodology for estimating the morphodynamic evolution of a cross-shore sandy coastal profile. In our approach, wave-driven cross-shore sediment flux depends on three components: two onshore-directed terms (wave asymmetry and wave streaming) and an offshore-directed slope term. In contrast with previous work, which applies shallow water wave assumptions across the transitional zone of the lower shoreface, we use linear Airy wave theory. The cross-shore sediment transport formulation defines a dynamic equilibrium profile and, by perturbing about this steady state profile, we present an advection-diffusion formula for profile evolution. Morphodynamic Péclet analysis suggests that the shoreface is diffusionally dominated. Using this depth-dependent characteristic diffusivity timescale, we distinguish a morphodynamic depth of closure for a given time envelope. Even though wave-driven sediment transport can (and will) occur at depths deeper than this morphodynamic closure depth, the rate of morphologic bed changes in response to shoreline change becomes asymptotically slow. Linear wave theory suggests a shallower shoreface depth of closure and much sharper break in processes than shallow water wave assumptions. Analyzing hindcasted wave data using a weighted frequency-magnitude approach, we determine representative wave conditions for selected sites along the U.S. coastline. Computed equilibrium profiles and depths of closure demonstrate reasonable similarities, except where inheritance is strong. The methodology espoused in this paper can be used to better understand the morphodynamics at the lower shoreface transition with relative ease across a variety of sites and with varied sediment transport equations.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195', 'afid': '60022195', 'affilname': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013609', 'afid': '60013609', 'affilname': 'Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ortiz A.C.', 'Ashton A.D.']","['55365569400', '7006312593']",morphodynamic evolution | sediment transport | wave base,NSF,CNH-0815875,"Ocean Life Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution",,1518503

Relict barrier deposits preserved on the shelf seabed from barrier transgression are common features of passive, sandy margins, with multiple deposits occasionally found evenly spaced several to tens of kilometers apart. The formation of these deposits has typically been ascribed to allogenic overstepping processes, most commonly to episodes of rapid sea-level rise, although changes in topography or external sediment supply have also been invoked. Here, we present a mechanism whereby autogenic feedbacks between shoreface dynamics and the landward overwash of sediments can form regularly spaced shelf deposits even with constantly rising sea level. A simple morphodynamic model of barrier transgression exhibits a mode of periodic retreat whereby alternating episodes of translation and aggradation arise from internal dynamics, generating low-relief cross-shore deposits of barrier sediment with kilometer-scale spacing that increases for more gradual shelf slopes. Modeled barriers develop autogenic partial overstepping on shelf slopes with gradients between 1 and 3 m/km and for rates of sea-level rise between 1 and 18 mm/yr. Deposits produced by the model correlate with field observations of overstepped barriers from around the world, sharing an inverse relationship between shelf slope and spacing (wavelength).

Using a combination of historical shoreline-change mapping, sediment sampling, three-dimensional beach surveys, and hydrodynamic modeling of nearshore and inlet processes, this study explored the feedbacks between periodic coastal erosion patterns and associated mitigation responses, focusing on the open-ocean and inner-inlet beaches of Plum Island and the Merrimack River Inlet, Massachusetts, United States. Installation of river-mouth jetties in the early 20th century stabilized the inlet, allowing residential development in northern Plum Island, but triggering successive, multi-decadal cycles of alternating beach erosion and accretion along the inner-inlet and oceanfront beaches. At a finer spatial scale, the formation and southerly migration of an erosion “hotspot” (a setback of the high-water line by ∼100 m) occurs regularly (every 25–40 years) in response to the refraction of northeast storm waves around the ebb-tidal delta. Growth of the delta progressively shifts the focus of storm wave energy further down-shore, replenishing updrift segments with sand through the detachment, landward migration, and shoreline-welding of swash bars. Monitoring recent hotspot migration (2008–2014) demonstrates erosion (>30,000 m3 of sand) along a 350-m section of beach in 6 months, followed by recovery, as the hotspot migrated further south. In response to these erosion cycles, local residents and governmental agencies attempted to protect shorefront properties with a variety of soft and hard structures. The latter have provided protection to some homes, but enhanced erosion elsewhere. Although the local community is in broad agreement about the need to plan for long-term coastal changes associated with sea-level rise and increased storminess, real-time responses have involved reactions mainly to short-term (<5 years) erosion threats. A collective consensus for sustainable management of this area is lacking and the development of a longer-term adaptive perspective needed for proper planning has been elusive. With a deepening understanding of multi-decadal coastal dynamics, including a characterization of the relative contributions of both nature and humans, we can be more optimistic that adaptations beyond mere reactions to shoreline change are achievable.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033461', 'afid': '60033461', 'affilname': 'University of Massachusetts Lowell', 'affiliation-city': 'Lowell', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029194', 'afid': '60029194', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina Wilmington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wilmington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028628', 'afid': '60028628', 'affilname': 'Northeastern University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022758', 'afid': '60022758', 'affilname': 'University of New Orleans', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018179', 'afid': '60018179', 'affilname': 'University of South Carolina', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbia', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016053', 'afid': '60016053', 'affilname': 'Virginia Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Gloucester Point', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013609', 'afid': '60013609', 'affilname': 'Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122716081', 'afid': '122716081', 'affilname': 'Storm Surge: The Merrimack Valley Coastal Adaptation Workgroup', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hein C.J.', 'Fallon A.R.', 'Rosen P.', 'Hoagland P.', 'Georgiou I.Y.', 'FitzGerald D.M.', 'Morris M.', 'Baker S.', 'Marino G.B.', 'Fitzsimons G.']","['21734503200', '57191169061', '56350442300', '7003759731', '7005526505', '7202364366', '57209328143', '57209790323', '57209330519', '57191170443']",Beach erosion | Coastal adaptation | Developed beach | Shoreline change | Tidal-inlet dynamics,NSF,OCE 1325430,National Science Foundation,,1518503

Coastal barrier systems around the world are experiencing higher rates of flooding and shoreline erosion. Property owners on barriers have made significant financial investments in physical protections that shield their nearby properties from these hazards, constituting a type of adaptation to shoreline change. Factors that contribute to adaptation on Plum Island, a developed beach and dune system on the North Shore of Massachusetts, are investigated here. Plum Island experiences patterns of shoreline change that may be representative of many inlet-associated beaches, encompassing an equivocal and dynamically shifting mix of erosion and accretion. In the face of episodic floods and fleeting erosive events, and driven by a combination of strong northeast storms and cycles of erosion and accretion, the value of the average Plum Island residence increases by 34% for properties on the oceanfront where protection comprises a publicly constructed soft structure. Even in the face of state policies that ostensibly discourage physical protection as a means of adaptation, coastal communities face significant political and financial pressures to maintain existing protective structures or to allow contiguous groups of property owners to build new ones through collective action. These factors mitigate against adapting to shoreline change by retreating from the coast, thereby potentially increasing the adverse effects of coastal hazards.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016053', 'afid': '60016053', 'affilname': 'Virginia Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Gloucester Point', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013609', 'afid': '60013609', 'affilname': 'Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000030', 'afid': '60000030', 'affilname': 'University of Virginia School of Law', 'affiliation-city': 'Charlottesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119500482', 'afid': '119500482', 'affilname': 'GGF Historical Consultants', 'affiliation-city': 'Lowell', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/102055271', 'afid': '102055271', 'affilname': 'Applied Coastal Research and Engineering', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fallon A.R.', 'Hoagland P.', 'Jin D.', 'Phalen W.', 'Fitzsimons G.G.', 'Hein C.J.']","['57191169061', '7003759731', '7201973590', '56880293200', '57191170443', '21734503200']",adaptation | coastal dune resource | hedonic pricing | structural protection | tidal-associated inlet,NSF,OCE 1325430,National Science Foundation,,1518503

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Storm-driven sediment fluxes onto and behind barrier islands help coastal barrier systems keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). Understanding what controls cross-shore sediment flux magnitudes is critical for making accurate forecasts of barrier response to increased SLR rates. Here, using an existing morphodynamic model for barrier island evolution, observations are used to constrain model parameters and explore potential variability in future barrier behavior. Using modeled drowning outcomes as a proxy for vulnerability to SLR, 0%, 28%, and 100% of the barrier is vulnerable to SLR rates of 4, 7, and 10 mm/yr, respectively. When only overwash fluxes are increased in the model, drowning vulnerability increases for the same rates of SLR, suggesting that future increases in storminess may increase island vulnerability particularly where sediment resources are limited. Developed sites are more vulnerable to SLR, indicating that anthropogenic changes to overwash fluxes and estuary depths could profoundly affect future barrier response to SLR.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012621', 'afid': '60012621', 'affilname': 'Montclair State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montclair', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Miselis J.', 'Lorenzo-Trueba J.']","['54973851300', '28167497900']",barrier island | human impacts | morphodynamic model | New Jersey | sea level rise,NJDEP,CNH-1518503,New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection,,1518503

In regions rich in natural resources, nature-based tourism is advancing rapidly. This form of development is identified as an important economic opportunity for local communities but can impact ecosystem services through rapid landscape transformation, threatening the livelihoods of the most impoverished sectors of a community. While it is accepted that communities should participate in the planning process, variation in community and household-level landscape dependencies and priorities can create a fractured viewpoint that is difficult to integrate into the land planning process. Power structures and special interests can subvert participatory processes and input at the community level. In the Chobe District, Northern Botswana, tourism, and other related developments had occurred at a rapid pace around the Chobe National Park creating access barriers, in some instances, to essential natural resource areas. We evaluate community landscape dependencies and participatory approaches to the development of inclusive land use maps. Spatial information on land use dependencies from household surveys were used to form the bases of reiterative village-level participatory mapping exercises (n = 179 households, six villages). The activities were conducted through traditional leadership structures. Landscape dependencies were widespread across study villages in both natural resource and agricultural sectors. Cluster and CART analysis of household data identified important variation in landscape dependencies between and within study villages. Fishing was the most important factor predicting gender of headship with male-headed households using this resource more frequently. Spatial data from these household consultations were used to create a draft map that was reiteratively refined through participatory map building exercises until final approval was provided by community members and their traditional leaders in a village. Scaled consultations and involvement of the traditional leadership limited the ability of power structures to control the process and/or subvert the interests of more vulnerable members of a community. Mapping outputs were later successfully used in land planning exercises and consultations. Development of inclusive community consensus on landscape dependencies should be undertaken before lucrative tourism ventures and land allocations are advanced in competition to the needs of more vulnerable and often voiceless sectors of a community.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119987', 'afid': '60119987', 'affilname': 'Centre for Conservation of African Resources: Animals, Communities, and Land use', 'affiliation-city': 'Kasane', 'affiliation-country': 'Botswana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Alexander K.', 'Ramotadima M.', 'Sanderson C.']","['7203058067', '6505621935', '16744537700']",Africa sustainability | Biodiversity | Botswana | Nature-based tourism | Participatory GIS | Rural livelihoods | Wetlands management,,1518486,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2212041617302942,1518486

Investigations into natural resource use and access are often limited to rural areas; such use is not considered an integral part of urban livelihood strategies, especially amongst the poor. With growing urban food insecurity, poverty, and unequal access to services, natural resource use may provide a viable alternative to cash-based resources, thus, allowing households to navigate the rural–urban continuum as they address livelihood needs. This may be especially pertinent for growing, but small, urban landscapes that are in transition. We investigated the use of and access to natural resources in households in rural (Lesoma), peri-urban (Kazungula), and urban (Kasane) settlements in northern Botswana. Semi-structured questionnaires for 85 households were used to investigate household demographics, variety of natural resources used, the availability, use, and importance of natural resources, threats to resources, harvesting locations, and extent of resource commercialization. Significant differences were identified in the mean number of resources used by households across the three settlements (Kruskal–Wallis Chi-squared = 9.29, df = 2, p = 0.01). Using the post hoc test Conover with Bonferroni adjustment, mean natural resource use between the urban and peri-urban villages did not differ significantly (p = 1). However, both types of villages differed from the rural village in mean resource use (urban p = 0.007 and peri-urban p = 0.012). Nevertheless, urban and peri-urban households reported use of a broad range of natural resources, highlighting the importance of these products in transitioning landscapes. Across the study villages, natural resource harvesting occurred predominantly on communal land. Primary barriers to resource access were perceived to be strict government regulations and decreasing resource availability. Natural resource commercialization was identified as a potential opportunity but was often carried out only on a small scale. The use of natural resources is intuitively thought to be associated with rural areas, but our results suggest that such resources form an important part of livelihoods across urban and peri-urban landscapes as well. This continued reliance on natural resources raises important planning questions about how to ensure both the ongoing conservation of forested and other natural areas, and the availability of associated resources for urban livelihoods. In this regard, small urban towns that are rapidly transitioning from rural landscapes provide a targeted opportunity for early intervention. Our findings underpin the vital role that natural areas play in supporting the livelihoods of the urban poor and highlight the need to encourage land designation and management of such areas not only for conservation but also as a safety net for vulnerable urban households.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119987', 'afid': '60119987', 'affilname': 'Centre for Conservation of African Resources: Animals, Communities, and Land use', 'affiliation-city': 'Kasane', 'affiliation-country': 'Botswana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000356', 'afid': '60000356', 'affilname': 'University of Cape Town', 'affiliation-city': 'Cape Town', 'affiliation-country': 'South Africa'}]",Journal,Article,"['Joos-Vandewalle S.', 'Wynberg R.', 'Alexander K.']","['57201028839', '6507637512', '7203058067']",,UCT,FCB00028,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2212041617303194,1518486

Little is known about the role of surface water in the propagation of antibiotic resistance (AR), or the relationship between AR and water quality declines. While healthcare and agricultural sectors are considered the main contributors to AR dissemination, few studies have been conducted in their absence. Using linear models and Bayesian kriging, we evaluate AR among Escherichia coli water isolates collected bimonthly from the Chobe River in Northern Botswana (n = 1997, n = 414 water samples; July 2011-May 2012) in relation to water quality dynamics (E. coli, fecal coliform, and total suspended solids), land use, season, and AR in wildlife and humans within this system. No commercial agricultural or large medical facilities exist within this region. Here, we identify widespread AR in surface water, with land use and season significant predicators of AR levels. Mean AR was significantly higher in the wet season than the dry season (p = 0.003), and highest in the urban landscape (2.15, SD = 0.098) than the protected landscape (1.39, SD = 0.051). In-water E. coli concentrations were significantly positively associated with mean AR in the wet season (p < 0.001) but not in the dry season (p = 0.110), with TSS negatively associated with mean AR across seasons (p = 0.016 and p = 0.029), identifying temporal and spatial relationships between water quality variables and AR. Importantly, when human, water, and wildlife isolates were examined, similar AR profiles were identified (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that direct human inputs are sufficient for extensive dispersal of AR into the environment, with landscape features, season, and water quality variables influencing AR dynamics. Focused and expensive efforts to minimize pollution from agricultural sources, while important, may only provide incremental benefits to the management of AR across complex landscapes. Controlling direct human AR inputs into the environment remains a critical and pressing challenge.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121458', 'afid': '60121458', 'affilname': 'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030101', 'afid': '60030101', 'affilname': 'University of Regina', 'affiliation-city': 'Regina', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113073783', 'afid': '113073783', 'affilname': 'Center for African Resources: Animals', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Botswana'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sanderson C.E.', 'Fox J.T.', 'Dougherty E.R.', 'Cameron A.D.S.', 'Alexander K.A.']","['16744537700', '34769820500', '56537895200', '8244146500', '7203058067']",Antibiotic resistance | Botswana | Dryland system | Escherichia coli | Water quality,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518486

In dryland systems, the flood pulse is the driving force in system dynamics but is highly variable in flow volume and landscape inundation features. Remote sensing can provide critical information fundamental to evaluating and forecasting flow behavior and population vulnerability; however, training and classifying an extensive time series of images is labor intensive, limiting the usefulness of these approaches in evaluating flood pulse dynamics and landscape interactions. Here, we provide an alternative approach that relies on only one set of [pooled] training samples for time series image classification and analysis.We test this approach by mapping the flood pulse in a time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from the Chobe River Basin of Botswana for the years 2014 to 2016. MODIS MOD09A1 images collected during the flooding season (February to July) were converted to Kauth'Thomas components, then sampled to form a training pool. Images were then classified using these pooled training samples. Results indicated that classification accuracies obtained using pooled training were statistically indistinguishable from classifications obtained from conventional training. Application of the method to another year's data (2013) also yielded comparably accurate results, suggesting that the training pool method remains robust when applied to image data other than that used to create the training pool.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Braget M.', 'Goodin D.', 'Wang J.', 'Hutchinson J.', 'Alexander K.']","['57202858959', '57193470841', '54682443200', '57202846781', '7203058067']",Classification | Flood Mapping | Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. | Times Series,,AGS 1518486,,,1518486

Complex couplings and feedback among climate, fire, and herbivory drive short- and long-term patterns of land cover change (LCC) in savanna ecosystems. However, understanding of spatial and temporal LCC patterns in these environments is limited, particularly for semi-arid regions transitional between arid andmore mesic climates. Here, we use post-classification analysis of Landsat TM(1990), ETM+ (2003), and OLI (2013) satellite imagery to classify and assess net and gross LCC for the Chobe District, a 21,000 km2 area encompassing urban, peri-urban, rural, communally-managed (Chobe Enclave), and protected land (Chobe National Park, CNP, and six protected forest reserves). We then evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of LCC in relation to precipitation, fire detections (MCD14M, 2001-2013) fromthe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and dry season elephant (Loxodonta africana) aerial survey data (2003, 2006, 2012, 2013). Woodland cover declined over the study period by 1514 km2 (16.2% of initial class total), accompanied by expansion of shrubland (1305 km2, 15.7%) and grassland (265 km2, 20.3%). Net LCC differed importantly in protected areas, with higherwoodland losses observed in forest reserves compared to the CNP. Loss of woodland was also higher in communally-managed land for the study period, despite gains from 2003-2013. Gross (class) changes were characterized by extensive exchange between woodland and shrubland during both time steps, and a large expansion of shrubland into grassland and bare ground from 2003-2013. MODIS active fire detections were highly variable from year to year and among the different protected areas, ranging from 1.8 fires*year-1/km2 in the Chobe Forest Reserve to 7.1 fires*year-1/km2 in the Kasane Forest Reserve Extension. Clustering and timing of dry season fires suggests that ignitions were predominately from anthropogenic sources. Annual fire count was significantly related to total annual rainfall (p = 0.009, adj. R2 = 0.50), with a 41% increase in average fire occurrence in years when rainfall exceeded long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP). Loss of woodland was significantly associated with fire in locations experiencing 15 or more ignitions during the period 2001-2013 (p = 0.024). Although elephant-mediated damage is often cited as a major cause of woodland degradation in northern Botswana, we observed little evidence of unsustainable pressure on woodlands fromgrowing elephant populations. Our data indicate broad-scale LCC processes in semi-arid savannas in Southern Africa are strongly coupled to environmental and anthropogenic forcings. Increased seasonal variability is likely to have important effects on the distribution of savanna plant communities due to climate-fire feedbacks. Long-term monitoring of LCC in these ecosystems is essential to improving land use planning and management strategies that protect biodiversity, as well as traditional cultures and livelihoods under future climate change scenarios for Southern Africa.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119987', 'afid': '60119987', 'affilname': 'Centre for Conservation of African Resources: Animals, Communities, and Land use', 'affiliation-city': 'Kasane', 'affiliation-country': 'Botswana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fox J.', 'Vandewalle M.', 'Alexander K.']","['34769820500', '7006014436', '7203058067']",Chobe | Disturbance | Drought | Dryland | Ecosystem services | Ecotone | Forest resources | KAZA | Non-linear change | Protected areas | Southern Africa | Sustainable livelihoods,,undefined,,,1518486

A telephone survey of businesses in New Orleans was conducted in October 2007, 26 months after Hurricane Katrina. The data were analyzed using a modified spatial probit regression model to evaluate the importance of each predictor variable through time. The results suggest that the two most important reopening predictors throughout all time periods were the flood depth at the business location and business size as represented by its wages in a logarithmic form. Flood depth was a significant negative predictor and had the largest marginal effects on the reopening probabilities. Smaller businesses had lower reopening probabilities than larger ones. However, the nonlinear response of business size to the reopening probability suggests that recovery aid would be most effective for smaller businesses than for larger ones. The spatial spillovers effect was a significant positive predictor but only for the first nine months. The findings show clearly that flood protection is the overarching issue for New Orleans. A flood protection plan that reduces the vulnerability and length of flooding would be the first and foremost step to mitigate the negative effects from climate-related hazards and enable speedy recovery. The findings cast doubt on the current coastal protection efforts and add to the current debate of whether coastal Louisiana will be sustainable or too costly to protect from further land loss and flooding given the threat of sea-level rise. Finally, a plan to help small businesses to return would also be an effective strategy for recovery, and the temporal window of opportunity that generates the greatest impacts would be the first 6~9 months after the disaster. © 2012 Lam et al.",23,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030452', 'afid': '60030452', 'affilname': 'Texas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Marcos', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lam N.', 'Arenas H.', 'Pace K.', 'LeSage J.', 'Campanella R.']","['7101750709', '26666557300', '7103233088', '26643220200', '35236257900']",,,undefined,,,1212112

The Atchafalaya River, the largest distributary of the Mississippi River, has one of the few prograding delta features along the ~200-km deltaic coastline. Understanding changes in the Atchafalaya River Delta complex (ARDC) development has critical implications for future prediction and management strategy for the Mississippi River Delta Plain. This study was organized to answer two major questions: (1) how did development of the ARDC respond to fluctuation in riverine sediment supply over the period 1989-2010, and (2) has vegetation succession helped stabilize subaerial land? The study quantified annual total suspended sediment yields to the two ARDC subdeltas-Atchafalaya River subdelta (ARSD) and Wax Lake outlet subdelta (WLSD)-classified delta land cover using satellite imagery over ~5-year intervals into three classes: barren land, vegetation, and open water and investigated the relationship of delta land change with sediment yield and vegetation succession. Over the entire 21-year study period, we found a net land gain of 59km2, with the ARSD accounting for 58% of this gain and WLSD 42%. Sediment yield to the subdeltas decreased from an average annual of 38megatonnes (MT) for ARSD and 18 MT for WLSD during 1989-1995 to an average annual of 24MT for ARSD and 17MT for WLSD during 2004-2010, corresponding to the decrease in riverine suspended sediment concentration. Concurrently, total land growth rate decreased from 2.4km2y-1 to 1.6km2y-1 for ARSD and 3.2km2y-1 to 0.6km2y-1 for WLSD. However, the ARDC had a net land loss of 2.1km2 during 1999-2004 because of tropical system effects in conjunction with the lack of large river floods (defined as discharge>13,800m3s-1). On average, more than 60% of newly vegetated land remained vegetated in subsequent years, and when compared with barren areas, vegetated land was less likely (7.3% vs. 32%) to be converted to water, indicating vegetative stabilization effect. However, during the period without a major flood, vegetation buffering against tropical system erosion was limited. This indicates that over the period 1989 to 2010 land growth of the ARDC was dictated by large flood events. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",36,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rosen T.', 'Xu Y.J.']","['54586011800', '7406451631']",Atchafalaya River | Delta progradation | Mississippi River Delta | Sediment yield | Vegetative stabilization,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169555X13002262,1212112

It has been documented that given the same type of climate related hazard and degree of exposure, the vulnerability of a region to the hazard and its resultant damages could be very different, depending on a number of natural and socioeconomic factors. An understanding of the factors contributing to the vulnerability of a region requires a good assessment method. This paper reports the results of a vulnerability assessment to hurricane hazards for the countries in the Caribbean region. The resultant index is a weighted combination of variables. The paper demonstrates a methodology to validate the weights of the variables used to compute the index through regression analysis with the storm damage data. The refined vulnerability indices for the 25 countries studied were found to range from 0.31 to 0.77. Small island countries were generally more vulnerable than large countries, with the highest vulnerability indices (>0.6) found in The Bahamas, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Turks and Caicos Is.

Hurricanes play an important role in shaping the coast of Louisiana. Although the sedimentary signatures of hurricane deposits have been documented in several different coastal environments along the northern Gulf coast, no studies have as yet documented the signatures in wetlands adjacent to large, inland brackish water bodies. In this paper we present results of a case study documenting the distribution and characteristics of storm surge deposits related to Hurricane Isaac (2012) in a wetland on the western shore of Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana. Hurricane Isaac, a category1 storm, made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River on August 28, 2012. Due to its large size and slow movement, Isaac generated strong easterly winds across Lake Pontchartrain, producing a large storm surge along the west shore of the lake and unprecedented flooding in the surrounding lowlands. Loss-on-ignition, XRF, radioisotopic, and grain-size analyses conducted on sediment cores and surface samples from the area identify two distinct sedimentary signatures for the Hurricane Isaac deposits. Near the lake shore the signature is characterized by a laminated silty sand with a geochemical profile closely resembling that of lake bed material. Storm deposits located in a brackish swamp ∼ 1km inland consist of a dark, low-organic mud with low concentrations of terrestrial metals and elevated concentrations of Br, S, and Cl. Differences in the storm signal are explained by the differing effect of topographical features on the depositional and transportation processes occurring at the two sites. Utilizing the geochemical/compositional signatures as a hurricane-generated storm surge proxy indicates the possible occurrence of a similar event predating the historical record.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liu K.', 'McCloskey T.', 'Bianchette T.', 'Keller G.', 'Lam N.', 'Cable J.', 'Arriola J.']","['7404199972', '24166962700', '43561110000', '57200347254', '7101750709', '7005219298', '57027929400']",Hurricane Isaac | Lake Pontchartrain | Louisiana | Paleotempestology | storm deposit | storm surge | wetland sedimentation,,undefined,,,1212112

This study was conducted in order to identify the geologic changes within a subsiding coastal region in the light of coastal recession and past hurricane activity. Previous studies show that Bay Champagne, a semi-circular lake near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, is subjected to subsidence rates between 1.0 and 1.2 cm year-1, the highest rate of retreat within the entire northern Gulf of Mexico. Loss-on-ignition (LOI) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses, employed to generate lithological and geochemical core profiles, identified three distinct sand layers measuring up to 50 cm in thickness deposited by recent hurricanes. LOI shows large decreases in water, organic, and carbonate contents, indicating the occurrence of marine inundation. Within each marine incursion layer terrestrial elemental concentrations as determined by XRF display large depletions. Grain size analysis of a portion of the core (30-86 cm) indicates the presence of two series of sequential high-energy storm deposits followed by intense fluvial flooding within Bay Champagne.

Many restoration projects rely on diversions from the Mississippi River, but uncertainty exists about the timing and the amount of actually available sediment. This study examined long-term (1980-2010) suspended sediment yield as affected by different hydrologic regimes to determine actual suspended sediment availability and how this may affect diversion management. A stage hydrograph-based approach was employed to quantify total suspended sediment load (SSL) of the lower Mississippi River at Tarbert Landing during three river flow conditions: Peak Flow Stage (stage = 16.8 m, discharge >32,000 m3 s-1), High Flow Stage (stage = 14.6 m, discharge = 25,000-32,000 m3 s-1), and Intermediate Flow Stage (Stage = 12.1 m, discharge = 18,000-25,000 m3 s-1). Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and SSL were maximized during High Flow and Intermediate Flow Stages, accounting for approximately 50% of the total annual sediment yield, even though duration of the stages accounted for only one-third of a year. Peak Flow Stage had the highest discharge, but significantly lower SSC (p < 0.05), indicating that diversion of the river at this stage would be less effective for sediment capture. The lower Mississippi River showed significantly higher SSC (p < 0.0001) and SSL (p < 0.0001) during the rising than the receding limb. When the flood pulse was rising, Intermediate Flow and High Flow Stages showed greater SSC and SSL than Peak Flow Stage. Together, Intermediate Flow and High Flow Stages on the rising limb annually discharged 28 megatonnes over approximately 42 days, identifying this to be the best period for sediment capture and diversion. © 2014 by the authors.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114379925', 'afid': '114379925', 'affilname': 'Midshore Riverkeeper Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Easton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rosen T.', 'Xu Y.']","['54586011800', '7406451631']",Flood hydrograph | Mississippi river | River diversion | Riverine sediment | Sediment management | Total suspended solids,,undefined,,,1212112

Current assessment and prediction of the impacts of sediment diversions have focused on the capture and dispersal of both water and sediment on the adjacent river side and the immediate outfall marsh area. However, little is known about the effects of sediment diversions on existing wetland surface elevation and vertical accretion dynamics in the receiving basin at the landscape scale. In this study, we used a spatial wetland surface elevation model developed in support of Louisiana's 2012 Coastal Master Plan to examine such landscape-scale effects of sediment diversions. Multiple sediment diversion projects were incorporated in the model to simulate surface elevation and vertical accretion for the next 50 years (2010-2060) under two environmental (moderate and less optimistic) scenarios. Specifically, we examined landscape-scale surface elevation and vertical accretion trends under diversions with different geographical locations, diverted discharge rates, and geomorphic characteristics of the receiving basin. Model results indicate that small diversions (<283m3s-1) tend to have limited effects of reducing landscape-scale elevation loss (<3%) compared to a future without action (FWOA) condition. Large sediment diversions (>1500m3s-1) are required to achieve landscape-level benefits to promote surface elevation via vertical accretion to keep pace with rising sea level. © 2014.",27,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032280', 'afid': '60032280', 'affilname': 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029698', 'afid': '60029698', 'affilname': 'National Wetlands Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008926', 'afid': '60008926', 'affilname': 'U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Vicksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003631', 'afid': '60003631', 'affilname': 'Western Washington University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bellingham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113092467', 'afid': '113092467', 'affilname': 'The Water Institute of the Gulf', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wang H.', 'Steyer G.', 'Couvillion B.', 'Rybczyk J.', 'Beck H.', 'Sleavin W.', 'Meselhe E.', 'Allison M.', 'Boustany R.', 'Fischenich C.', 'Rivera-Monroy V.']","['7501733919', '6604009489', '48861192200', '6602740025', '55779771800', '16246056500', '6603876037', '7102381741', '7003589403', '6506135037', '6603286088']",Deltaic wetlands | Sea-level rise | Sediment diversion | Subsidence | Surface elevation | Vertical accretion,NSF,DBCS 1212112,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0272771413005441,1212112

Assessing the vulnerability and resilience to coastal hazards is a critical worldwide issue, especially for hurricane-prone coastal regions such as the Caribbean. However, the development of a useful metric for vulnerability and resilience assessment has a lot of challenges. Cartography and GIS analysis can contribute effectively to the solution of the issue by integrating natural and human data layers for assessment, mapping, and visualization. This paper uses the new Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) model to assess the resilience of 25 countries in the Caribbean region to hurricanes. The RIM indices of the countries were computed using three variables representing three dimensions: exposure, damage, and recovery, and eight variables representing social-environmental capacity. The RIM resilience indices were mapped and compared with the vulnerability indices computed in a previous study. The results show that Turks & Caicos Islands had the highest resilience, whereas Montserrat had the lowest. This paper contributes to the hazard literature by demonstrating new vulnerability and resilience assessment methodologies that include validation and enable inference. The paper also contributes to the cartography and GIS literature by demonstrating the need to integrate data and perspectives from multiple disciplines and regions, as well as the ability of geospatial technology, in producing useful decision-making tools for a very pressing societal problem.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60138556', 'afid': '60138556', 'affilname': 'Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne', 'affiliation-city': 'Dijon', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013710', 'afid': '60013710', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal da Bahia', 'affiliation-city': 'Salvador', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Conference Paper,"['Lam N.S.N.', 'Qiang Y.', 'Arenas H.', 'Brito P.', 'Liu K.B.']","['7101750709', '36242248900', '26666557300', '26666515300', '7404199972']",adaptability | Caribbean | resilience | Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) model | vulnerability,,undefined,,,1212112

The abundant research examining aspects of social-ecological resilience, vulnerability, and hazards and risk assessment has yielded insights into these concepts and suggested the importance of quantifying them. Quantifying resilience is complicated by several factors including the varying definitions of the term applied in the research, difficulties involved in selecting and aggregating indicators of resilience, and the lack of empirical validation for the indices derived. This paper applies a new model, called the resilience inference measurement (RIM) model, to quantify resilience to climate-related hazards for 52 U.S. counties along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The RIM model uses three elements (exposure, damage, and recovery indicators) to denote two relationships (vulnerability and adaptability), and employs both K-means clustering and discriminant analysis to derive the resilience rankings, thus enabling validation and inference. The results yielded a classification accuracy of 94.2% with 28 predictor variables.

The catastrophic earthquake that struck Sichuan Province, China, in 2008 caused serious damage to Wenchuan County and surrounding areas in southwestern China. In recent years, great attention has been paid to the resilience of the affected area. This study applied the resilience inference measurement (RIM) model to quantify and validate the community resilience of 105 counties in the impacted area. The RIM model uses cluster analysis to classify counties into four resilience levels according to the exposure, damage, and recovery conditions. The model then applies discriminant analysis to quantify the influence of socioeconomic characteristics on the county’s resilience. Analysis results show that counties located at the epicenter had the lowest resilience, but counties immediately adjacent to the epicenter had the highest resilience capacities. Counties that were farther away from the epicenter returned to normal resiliency quickly. Socioeconomic variables—including sex ratio, per capita GDP, percent of ethnic minority, and medical facilities—were identified as the most influential characteristics influencing resilience.

Mass evacuation of urban areas due to hurricanes is a critical problem in emergency management that requires extensive basic and applied research. Previous research uses agent-based models to simulate individual vehicle and driver behavior, and is limited mostly to a small study area due to the complexity of the models and the computational time needed. To better understand evacuation behavior, simulating the evacuation traffic in a larger region is needed. This paper develops a two-level regional disaster evacuation model by coupling two agent-based models. The first model uses each census block centroid, weighted with its corresponding number of vehicles, as an agent to simulate the local road network traffic. The second model, developed on the platform of a commercial software program called VISSIM, treats each vehicle as an agent to simulate the interstate highway traffic. This two-level agent-based model was used to simulate hurricane evacuation traffic in New Orleans. Validation results with the real Hurricane Katrina's evacuation data confirm that the proposed model performs well in terms of high model accuracy (i.e., close agreement between the real and simulated traffic patterns) and short model running time. The modeling results show that the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the three major evacuation directions was 347.58. Under a simultaneous evacuation strategy, and with 240,251 vehicles in 17,744 agents (census blocks), it would take at least 46.3 hours to evacuate all residents from the New Orleans metropolitan area. This two-level modeling approach could serve as a practical tool for evaluating mass evacuation strategies in New Orleans and other similar urban areas.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60074952', 'afid': '60074952', 'affilname': 'AECOM Technology Corporation', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Angeles', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004715', 'afid': '60004715', 'affilname': 'ESRI', 'affiliation-city': 'Redlands', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101330228', 'afid': '101330228', 'affilname': 'RoyOMartin Lumber', 'affiliation-city': 'Alexandria', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liang W.', 'Lam N.S.N.', 'Qin X.', 'Ju W.']","['56706800800', '7101750709', '56706792500', '15065467300']",agent-based modeling | disaster evacuation | emergency planning | Hurricane Katrina | New Orleans | transportation,NSF,BCS-0802593,National Science Foundation,,1212112

The core consists of a top organic unit (peat to clayey peat) from 0-29 cm above a bottom clay unit at 30-59 cm depth. Four distinct zones, marked by gradual changes in organic content and elemental concentrations, occur in the clay unit. These changes probably reflect two cycles of slowly changing water depths. Hurricane Isaac's signature, a brown clay band at 3-5 cm, is identified based on the stratigraphic and compositional correspondence with the storm's event layer, documented from nearby sites.

As one of the most vulnerable coasts in the continental USA, the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) region has endured numerous hazards over the past decades. The sustainability of this region has drawn great attention from the international, national, and local communities, wanting to understand how the region as a system develops under intense interplay between the natural and human factors. A major problem in this deltaic region is significant land loss over the years due to a combination of natural and human factors. The main scientific and management questions are what factors contribute to the land use land cover (LULC) changes in this region, can we model the changes, and how would the LULC look like in the future given the current factors? This study analyzed the LULC changes of the region between 1996 and 2006 by utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) to derive the LULC change rules from 15 human and natural variables. The rules were then used to simulate future scenarios in a cellular automation model. A stochastic element was added in the model to represent factors that were not included in the current model. The analysis was conducted for two sub-regions in the study area for comparison. The results show that the derived ANN models could simulate the LULC changes with a high degree of accuracy (above 92 % on average).

A thorough understanding of sediment transport and deposition in the basin is not only required for proper management of the ARB, but is crucial for regional sediment budgets that affect the Mississippi River Delta Plain. In this study, we calculated 31 years (1980-2010) of total suspended sediment (TSS) inflow and outflow of the Atchafalaya River to quantify the long-term sediment retention in the basin. We then estimated sedimentation rates in the basin by spatially relating the retention with changes of turbid water area derived from Landsat imagery. The study found an annual average TSS inflow of 54.0 megatonnes (MT) and an annual average TSS outflow of 48.7 MT, resulting in an average annual retention of 5.3 MT.

Many river deltas in the world are vibrant economic regions, serving as transportation hubs, population centres, and commercial hotspots. However, today, many of these deltaic areas face a tremendous challenge with land loss due to a number of factors, such as reduced riverine sediment supply, coastal land erosion, subsidence, and sea level rise. The development of the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain (MRDP) in southeast Louisiana, USA, over the past century is a good example. Since 1932, approximately 4877 km2 of the coastal land of MRDP has become submerged. The lower Mississippi River main channel entering the Gulf of Mexico has become an isolated waterway with both sides losing land. In contrast, large open water areas in the Mississippi River's distributary basin, the Atchafalaya River basin, have been silted up over the past century, and the river mouth has developed a prograding delta feature at its two outlets to the Gulf of Mexico. The retrospective analysis of this paper makes it clear that the main cause of the land loss in the MRDP is not the decline of riverine sediment, but the disconnection of the sediment sources from the natural flood plains. Future sediment management efforts in the MRDP should focus on restoring the natural connection of riverine sediment supplies with flood plains, rather than solely using channelized river diversion. This could be achieved through controlled overbank flooding (COF) and artificial floods in conjunction with the use of a hydrograph-based sediment availability assessment.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Conference Proceeding,Conference Paper,['Jun Xu Y.'],['37028594900'],coastal geomorphology | fluvial deltas | Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system | river engineering | riverine sediment | sediment management,,undefined,,,1212112

The study first applied a focal filter to extract continuous urban areas from the scattered urban pixels in the original remote sensing images. Statistical analyses were applied to develop initial functions between urban growth probability and several driving factors. A genetic algorithm was then used to calibrate the transition function, and cellular automata simulation based on the transition function was conducted to evaluate future urban growth patterns with and without the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The results show that elevation has become a much more important factor after Hurricane Katrina, and urban growth has shifted to higher elevation regions. The elevation most probable for new urban growth increased from 10.84 to 11.90 meters. Moreover, simulated future urban growth in this region indicates a decentralized trend, with more growth occurring in more distant regions with higher elevation. In the New Orleans metropolitan area, urban growth will continue to spill across Lake Pontchartrain to the satellite towns that are more than 50 minutes away by driving from the city center.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qiang Y.', 'Lam N.']","['36242248900', '7101750709']",cellular automata | coastal sustainability | coupled natural-human dynamics | genetic algorithm | Hurricane Katrina | Mississippi delta,,R/S-05-PD,,,1212112

This paper presents an assessment of community resilience to coastal hazards in the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) region in southeastern Louisiana. The assessment was conducted at the census block group scale. The specific purpose of this study was to provide a quantitative method to assess and validate the community resilience to coastal hazards, and to identify the relationships between a set of socio-environmental indicators and community resilience. The Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) model was applied to assess the resilience of the block groups. The resilience index derived was empirically validated through two statistical procedures: K-means cluster analysis of exposure, damage, and recovery variables to derive the resilience groups, and discriminant analysis to identify the key indicators of resilience. The discriminant analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 73.1%. The results show that block groups with higher resilience were concentrated generally in the northern part of the study area, including those located north of Lake Pontchartrain and in East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, and Lafayette parishes. The lower-resilience communities were located mostly along the coastline and lower elevation area including block groups in southern Plaquemines Parish and Terrebonne Parish. Regression analysis between the resilience scores and the indicators extracted from the discriminant analysis suggests that community resilience was significantly linked to multicomponent capacities. The findings could help develop adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability, increase resilience, and improve long-term sustainability for the coastal region.",32,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cai H.', 'Lam N.', 'Zou L.', 'Qiang Y.', 'Li K.']","['56797269800', '7101750709', '56797356100', '36242248900', '56797037900']",Coastal hazards | Community resilience | Disaster recovery | Lower Mississippi River Basin | Multivariate statistics | Spatial analysis | The Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) model,,1427389,,,1212112

High subsidence rates, along with eustatic sea-level change, sediment accumulation and shoreline erosion have led to widespread land loss and the deterioration of ecosystem health around the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB). A proper evaluation of the spatial pattern of subsidence rates in the LMRB is the key to understanding the mechanisms of the submergence, estimating its potential impacts on land loss and the long-term sustainability of the region. Based on the subsidence rate data derived from benchmark surveys from 1922 to 1995, this paper constructed a subsidence rate surface for the region through the empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) interpolation method. The results show that the subsidence rates in the region ranged from 1.7 to 29 mm/year, with an average rate of 9.4 mm/year. Subsidence rates increased from north to south as the outcome of both regional geophysical conditions and anthropogenic activities. Four areas of high subsidence rates were found, and they are located in Orleans, Jefferson, Terrebonne and Plaquemines parishes. A projection of future landscape loss using the interpolated subsidence rates reveals that areas below zero elevation in the LMRB will increase from 3.86% in 2004 to 19.79% in 2030 and 30.88% in 2050. This translates to a growing increase of areas that are vulnerable to land loss from 44.3 km2/year to 240.7 km2/year from 2011 to 2050. Under the same scenario, Lafourche, Plaquemines and Terrebonne parishes will experience serious loss of wetlands, whereas Orleans and Jefferson parishes will lose significant developed land, and Lafourche parish will endure severe loss of agriculture land.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zou L.', 'Kent J.', 'Lam N.', 'Cai H.', 'Qiang Y.', 'Li K.']","['56797356100', '12761561000', '7101750709', '56797269800', '36242248900', '56797037900']",Bayesian kriging | Coastal Louisiana | Land loss | Mississippi Delta | Subsidence rates | Sustainability,,undefined,,,1212112

Rapid land loss in the Mississippi River Delta Plain has led to intensive efforts by state and federal agencies for finding solutions in coastal land restoration in the past decade. One of the proposed solutions includes diversion of the Mississippi River water into drowning wetland areas. Although a few recent studies have investigated flow-sediment relationships in the Lowermost Mississippi River (LmMR, defined as the 500 km reach from the Old River Control Structure to the river's Gulf outlet), it is unclear how individual sediment fractions behave under varying flow conditions of the river. The information can be especially pertinent because the quantity of coarse sands plays a critical role for the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River deltaic development. In this study, we utilized long-term (1973-2013) records on discharge and sediments at Tarbert Landing of the LmMR to assess sand behavior and availability under different river flow regimes, and extreme sand transport events and their recurrence. We found an average annual sand load (SL) of 27.2 megatonnes (MT) during 1973 and 2013, varying largely from 3.37 to 52.30 MT. For the entire 41-year study period, a total of approximately 1115 MT sand were discharged at Tarbert Landing, half of which occurred during the peak 20% flow events. A combination of intermediate, high and peak flow stages (i.e., river discharge was ≥18,000 cubic meter per second) produced about 71% of the total annual SL within approximately 120 days of a year. Based on the long-term sediment assessment, we predict that the LmMR has a high likelihood to transport 4 to 446 thousand tonnes of sand every day over the next 40 years, during which annual sand loads could reach a maximum of 51.68 MT. Currently, no effective plan is in place to utilize this considerably high sand quantity and we suggest that river engineering and sediment management in the LmMR consider practices of hydrograph-based approach for maximally capturing riverine sediments.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Joshi S.', 'Xu Y.J.']","['57037696300', '7406451631']",Extreme event analysis of sands | Hydrograph-based sediment assessment | Mississippi River | Sand transport | Tarbert Landing,USACE,LAB94230,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,,1212112

The formation of channel bars has been recognized as the most significant sediment response to the highly trained Mississippi River (MR). However, no quantitative study exists on the dynamics of emerged channel bars and associated sediment accumulation in the last 500-kilometer reach of the MR from the Gulf of Mexico outlet, also known as the lowermost Mississippi River. Such knowledge is especially critical for riverine sediment management to impede coastal land loss in the Mississippi River Delta. In this study, we utilized a series of satellite images taken from August 2010 to January 2012 to assess the changes in surface area and volume of three large emerged channel bars in the lowermost MR following an unprecedented spring flood in 2011. River stage data were collected to develop a rating curve of surface areas detected by satellite images with flow conditions for each of the three bars. A uniform geometry associated with the areal change was assumed to estimate the bar volume changes. Our study reveals that the 2011 spring flood increased the surface area of the bars by 3.5% to 11.1%, resulting in a total surface increase of 7.3%, or 424,000 m2. Based on the surface area change, we estimated a total bar volume increase of 4.4%, or 1,219,900 m3. This volume increase would be equivalent to a sediment trapping of approximately 1.0 million metric tons, assuming a sediment bulk density of 1.2 metric tons per cubic meter. This large quantity of sediment is likely an underestimation because of the neglect of subaqueous bar area change and the assumption of a uniform geometry in volume estimation. Nonetheless, the results imply that channel bars in the lowermost MR are capable of capturing a substantial amount of sediment during floods, and that a thorough assessment of their long-term change can provide important insights into sediment trapping in the lowermost MR as well as the feasibility of proposed river sediment diversions.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wang B.', 'Xu Y.J.']","['56991603100', '7406451631']",Channel bars | Channel dynamics | Fluvial geomorphology | Lowermost Mississippi River | Sediment transport,,undefined,,,1212112

Residents of south Louisiana face a range of increasing, climate-related flood exposure risks that could be reduced through local floodplain management and hazard mitigation planning. A major incentive for community planning to reduce exposure to flood risks is offered by the Community Rating System (CRS) of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP encourages local collective action by offering reduced flood insurance premiums for individual policy holders of communities where suggested risk-reducing measures have been implemented. This preliminary analysis examines the extent to which parishes (counties) in southern Louisiana have implemented the suggested policy actions and identifies key factors that account for variation in the implementation of the measures. More measures implemented results in higher CRS scores. Potential influences on scores include socioeconomic attributes of residents, government capacity, average elevation and past flood events. The results of multiple regression analysis indicate that higher CRS scores are associated most closely with higher median housing values. Furthermore, higher scores are found in parishes with more local municipalities that participate in the CRS program. The number of floods in the last five years and the revenue base of the parish does not appear to influence CRS scores. The results shed light on the conditions under which local adaptive planning to mitigate increasing flood risks is more likely to be implemented and offer insights for program administrators, researchers and community stakeholders.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Paille M.', 'Reams M.', 'Argote J.', 'Lam N.', 'Kirby R.']","['57159889200', '6602525988', '57159983600', '7101750709', '57158617400']",Adaptive governance | Community rating system | NFIP | Planning | Resilience,,undefined,,,1212112

Airborne fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) are often generated through widely-used thermal processes such as the combustion of fuels or the thermal decomposition of waste. Residents near Superfund sites are exposed to PM through the inhalation of windblown dust, ingestion of soil and sediments, and inhalation of emissions from the on-site thermal treatment of contaminated soils. Epidemiological evidence supports a link between exposure to airborne PM and an increased risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. It is well-known that during combustion processes, incomplete combustion can lead to the production of organic pollutants that can adsorb to the surface of PM. Recent studies have demonstrated that their interaction with metal centers can lead to the generation of a surface stabilized metal-radical complex capable of redox cycling to produce ROS. Moreover, these free radicals can persist in the environment, hence their designation as Environmentally Persistent Free Radicals (EPFR). EPFR has been demonstrated in both ambient air PM2.5 (diameter < 2.5 μm) and in PM from a variety of combustion sources. Thus, low-temperature, thermal treatment of soils can potentially increase the concentration of EPFR in areas in and around Superfund sites. In this review, we will outline the evidence to date supporting EPFR formation and its environmental significance. Furthermore, we will address the lack of methodologies for specifically addressing its risk assessment and challenges associated with regulating this new, emerging contaminant.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026632', 'afid': '60026632', 'affilname': 'School of Veterinary Medicine', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002194', 'afid': '60002194', 'affilname': 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Memphis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Dugas T.R.', 'Lomnicki S.', 'Cormier S.A.', 'Dellinger B.', 'Reams M.']","['6603322132', '6602425142', '7006569525', '7005174006', '6602525988']",Combustion | Free radicals | Incineration | Particulate matter | PM 2.5 | Superfund sites,,undefined,,,1212112

The catastrophic earthquake that struck Sichuan Province, China, in 2008 caused serious damage to Wenchuan County and surrounding areas in southwestern China. In recent years, great attention has been paid to the resilience of the affected area. This study applied the resilience inference measurement (RIM) model to quantify and validate the community resilience of 105 counties in the impacted area. The RIM model uses cluster analysis to classify counties into four resilience levels according to the exposure, damage, and recovery conditions. The model then applies discriminant analysis to quantify the influence of socioeconomic characteristics on the county’s resilience. Analysis results show that counties located at the epicenter had the lowest resilience, but counties immediately adjacent to the epicenter had the highest resilience capacities. Counties that were farther away from the epicenter returned to normal resiliency quickly. Socioeconomic variables—including sex ratio, per capita GDP, percent of ethnic minority, and medical facilities—were identified as the most influential characteristics influencing resilience.

This article conducts a national, county-based assessment of the changes in population and urban areas in high-risk flood zones from 2001 to 2011 in the contiguous United States. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) 100-year flood maps, land cover data, and census data were used to extract the proportion of developed (urban) land in flood zones by county at the two time points, and indexes of difference were calculated. Local Moran's I statistic was applied to identify hot spots of increase in urban area in flood zones, and geographically weighted regression was used to estimate the population in flood zones from the land cover data. Results show that in 2011, an estimate of about 25.3 million people (8.3 percent of the total population) lived in high-risk flood zones. Nationally, the ratio of urban development in flood zones is less than the ratio of land in flood zones, implying that Americans were responsive to flood hazards by avoiding development in flood zones. This trend varied from place to place, however, with coastal counties having less urban development in flood zones than the inland counties. Furthermore, the contrast between coastal and inland counties increased between 2001 and 2011. Finally, several exceptions from the trend (hot spots) were detected, most notably in New York City and Miami, where significant increases in urban development in flood zones were found. This assessment provides important baseline information on the spatial patterns of flood exposure and their changes from 2001 to 2011.

In this study, we analyzed 3-decadal morphological changes of the 10-km river channel and the three bars to elucidate the long-term effects of river engineering including diversion, revetment and dike constructions. Satellite images captured between 1985 and 2015 in approximate 5-year intervals were selected to estimate the change of channel morphology and bar surface area. The images were chosen based on river stage heights at the time when they were captured to exclude the temporal water height effect on channel and bar morphology. Using a set of the satellite images captured during the period of 1984–1986 and of 2013–2014, we developed rating curves of emerged bar surface area with the corresponding river stage height for determining the change in bar volume from 1985 to 2013. Two of the three bars have grown substantially in the past 30 years, while one bar has become braided and its surface area has shrunken. As a whole, there were a net gain of 4,107,000 m2 in surface area and a net gain of 30,271,000 m3 in volume, an equivalent of approximately 36 million metric tons of sediment assuming a bulk density of 1.2 t/m3. Sediment trapping on the bars was prevalent during the spring floods, especially during the period of 1990–1995 and of 2007–2011 when large floods occurred.

Coastal communities faced with multiple hazards have shown uneven responses and behaviors. These responses and behaviors could be better understood by analyzing real-time social media data through categorizing them into the three phases of the emergency management: preparedness, response, and recovery. This study analyzes the spatial–temporal patterns of Twitter activities during Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. Northeast on 29 October 2012. The study area includes 126 counties affected by Hurricane Sandy. The objectives are threefold: (1) to derive a set of common indexes from Twitter data so that they can be used for emergency management and resilience analysis; (2) to examine whether there are significant geographical and social disparities in disaster-related Twitter use; and (3) to test whether Twitter data can improve postdisaster damage estimation. Three corresponding hypotheses were tested. Results show that common indexes derived from Twitter data, including ratio, normalized ratio, and sentiment, could enable comparison across regions and events and should be documented. Social and geographical disparities in Twitter use existed in the Hurricane Sandy event, with higher disaster-related Twitter use communities generally being communities of higher socioeconomic status. Finally, adding Twitter indexes into a damage estimation model improved the adjusted R2 from 0.46 to 0.56, indicating that social media data could help improve postdisaster damage estimation, but other environmental and socioeconomic variables influencing the capacity to reducing damage might need to be included. The knowledge gained from this study could provide valuable insights into strategies for utilizing social media data to increase resilience to disasters.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013791', 'afid': '60013791', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100360845', 'afid': '100360845', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zou L.', 'Lam N.S.N.', 'Cai H.', 'Qiang Y.']","['56797356100', '7101750709', '56797269800', '36242248900']",geographical and social disparities in disaster resilience | Hurricane Sandy | social media | Twitter use,,1620451,,,1212112

Channel bars are a major depositional feature in alluvial rivers and their morphodynamics has been investigated intensively in the past several decades. However, relatively less is known about how channel bars in alluvial rivers respond to river engineering and regulations. In this study, we assessed 30-yr morphologic changes of 30 large emerged bars located in a 223 km reach of the highly regulated Lower Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi, to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River diversion. Landsat imagery and river stage data between 1985 and 2015 were utilized to characterize bar morphologic features and quantify decadal changes. Based on bar surface areas estimated with the satellite images at different river stages, a rating curve was developed for each of the 30 bars to determine their volumes. Results from this study show that the highly regulated river reach favored the growth of mid-channel and attached bars, while more than half of the point bars showed degradation. Currently, the mid-channel and attached bars accounted for 38% and 34% of the total volume of the 30 bars. The average volume of a single mid-channel bar is over two times that of an attached bar and over four times that of a point bar. Overall, in the past three decades, the total volume of the studied 30 bars increased by 110,118,000 m3 (41%). Total dike length in a dike field was found mostly contributing to the bar volume increase. Currently, the emerged volume of the 30 bars was estimated approximately 378,183,000 m3. The total bar volume is equivalent to ~ 530 million metric tons of coarse sand, based on an average measured bulk density of 1.4 t/m3 for the bar sediment. The findings show that these bars are large sediment reservoirs.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wang B.', 'Xu Y.J.']","['56991603100', '7406451631']",Alluvial river | Channel bar | Mississippi River | River engineering | River morphology | Sediment transport,USDA,LAB94230,U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169555X17304142,1212112

Hedonic pricing, estimating the value of housing characteristics through the use of transactions data, is one of the most common tasks performed by real estate researchers. However, transaction frequency varies over time, locations, and other factors. In contrast, two-thirds of homeowners have mortgages that they pay each month. This manuscript explores the use of mortgage payment data as an alternative or supplemental means to derive the value of housing characteristics. Insofar as price affects default and housing characteristic values determine price, housing characteristic values affect default. The implicit housing characteristic values come from parameter values that fit observed patterns of payments and defaults. We find a strong correlation (0.74−0.92) between the transaction-based and the implicit approaches. In addition, the Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the mortgage based pricing model has potential to help reveal housing market information especially during low sales activity and/or high default rate situations.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122589', 'afid': '60122589', 'affilname': 'E.

This study developed a spatial dynamic model to examine the coupled natural–human responses in the form of changes in population and associated developed land area in the Lower Mississippi River Basin region. The goal was to identify key socioeconomic factors (utility) and environmental factors (hazard damages, elevation, and subsidence rate) that affected population changes, as well as to examine how population changes affected the local utility and the local environment reciprocally. We first applied areal interpolation techniques with the volume-preserving property to transform all the data at Year 2000 into a unified 3 km by 3 km cellular space. We then built an Elastic Net model to extract 12 variables from a set of 33 for the spatial dynamic model. Afterward, we calibrated the neighborhood effects with a genetic algorithm and use the spatial dynamic model to simulate population and developed land area in 2010. Furthermore, we took a Monte Carlo approach for analyzing the uncertainty of the model outcome. Our accuracy assessment shows that the model on average slightly overpredicts the number of population and the developed land percentage at 2010, as indicated by the low values of mean absolute deviation (MAD) due to quantity. On the other hand, the MADs due to allocation are larger than the MADs due to quantity, with most outliers found in the New Orleans region where population and urban development declined significantly during 2000–2010 after Hurricane Katrina. The proposed model sheds light on the complex relationships between coastal hazards and human responses and provides useful insights to strategic development for coastal sustainability.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li K.', 'Lam N.']","['56797037900', '7101750709']",coastal hazards | Coupled natural–human system | Mississippi Delta | population dynamics | resilience,NSF,1427389,National Science Foundation,,1212112

It is widely known that the same type and strength of hazard could lead to very uneven impacts on different communities due to their varying vulnerability and resilience capacity. Hence, identifying the factors that make a community more resilient to hazards is critical to its sustainability and is central to climate change research and planning. This paper addresses three questions: what is the best way to measure community resilience to disasters and how to identify the key indicators? How do the resilience indicators dynamically interact in a quantitative manner that would lead to long-term resilience? And how can we translate the scientific results into practical tools for decision making? Using the population change pattern in the Mississippi River Delta as a case study, this paper demonstrates the use of a relatively new resilience assessment method called the Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) method to measure resilience. Then, a newly developed spatial dynamic model is used to simulate population changes in the study area.

This study develops a linear regression model to select local, low-collinear explanatory variables. This model combines two well-known models: geographically weighted regression (GWR) and elastic net (EN). The GWR model posits that the regression coefficients vary as a function of location and focuses on solving the problem of explaining the relationships under the spatially nonstationary condition, which a global model cannot solve. GWR cannot fulfill the task of variable selection, however, which is problematic when there are many explanatory variables with nonnegligible multicollinearity. On the other hand, the EN model is a member of the regulated regression family. EN can trim the number of explanatory variables and select the most important ones by adding penalty terms in its cost function, and it has been proven to be robust under the high-multicollinearity condition. The EN model is a global model, however, and does not consider the spatial nonstationarity. To overcome these deficiencies, we proposed the geographically weighted elastic net (GWEN) model. GWEN uses the kernel weights derived from GWR and applies EN locally to select variables for each geographical location. The result is a set of locally selected, low-collinear explanatory variables with spatially varying coefficients. We demonstrated the GWEN method on a data set relating population changes to a set of social, economic, and environmental variables in the Lower Mississippi River Basin. The results show that GWEN has the advantages of both the high prediction accuracy of GWR and the low multicollinearity among explanatory variables of EN.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311', 'afid': '60029311', 'affilname': 'University of Southern California', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Angeles', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100360845', 'afid': '100360845', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li K.', 'Lam N.S.N.']","['56797037900', '7101750709']",elastic net | geographically weighted elastic net | geographically weighted regression | spatial nonstationarity | variable selection,,1427389,,,1212112

Riverbed scour of bridge piers can cause rapid loss in foundation strength, leading to sudden bridge collapse. This study used multi-beam echo sounders (Seabat 7125) to map riverbed surrounding the foundations of four major bridges in the lower, middle, and upper reaches of the 700-km Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) during June 2015 and September 2016. The high-resolution data were utilized to analyze the morphology of the bridge scour and the deformation of the wide-area riverbed (i.e., 5–18 km long and 1.3–8.3 km wide). In addition, previous bathymetric measurements collected in 1998, 2009, and 2013 were used to determine riverbed erosion and deposition at the bridge reaches. Our study shows that the scour depth surrounding the bridge foundations progressed up to 4.4–19.0 m in the YRE. Over the past 5–15 years, the total channel erosion in some river reaches was up to 15–17 m, possessing a threat to the bridge safety in the YRE. Tide cycles seemed to have resulted in significant variation in the scour morphology in the lower and middle YRE. In the lower YRE, the riverbed morphology displayed one long erosional ditch on both sides of the bridge foundations and a long-strip siltation area distributed upstream and downstream of the bridge foundations; in the middle YRE, the riverbed morphology only showed erosional morphology surrounding the bridge foundations. Large dunes caused deep cuts and steeper contours in the bridge scour. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the high-resolution grid model formed by point cloud data of multi-beam echo sounders can clearly display the morphology of the bridge scour in terms of wide areas and that the sonar technique is a very useful tool in the assessment of bridge scours.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073624', 'afid': '60073624', 'affilname': 'State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zheng S.', 'Xu Y.J.', 'Cheng H.', 'Wang B.', 'Lu X.']","['56925830100', '7406451631', '23059434600', '56991603100', '57148933600']",Bridge foundation | Bridge scour | Channel morphology | Multi-beam echo sounders | Riverbed erosion | The Yangtze River Estuary,CSC,201606140126,China Scholarship Council,,1212112

Developing tools or metrics for measuring and monitoring progress of resilience is a critical component that requires extensive research to achieve better understanding. However, different fields have different emphases and the knowledge gained from the various studies are scattered and fragmented. To provide an integration of the literature and reflect on the current state of resilience measurement, we conducted a synthesis analysis through a systematic review of 174 scholarly articles on disaster resilience measurement from 2005 to 2017. Using a review table designed for this study and content analysis, we extracted key information from each article on resilience definition, type of measurement method, resilience indicators used, and proposed adaptation strategies. Results indicate that 39.7% of the articles used qualitative methods for resilience measurement and 39.1% of the articles used quantitative methods. However, only 10.3% of all the 174 articles conducted empirical validation of their proposed resilience indices. The three most frequently suggested adaptation strategies were empowering local governments and leaders, raising community awareness, and enhancing community infrastructure and communication. These findings suggest that future research need to incorporate validation and inferential ability into resilience measurement.

Existing price indices are based on real estate sales. This approach encounters problems when (1) sales are infrequent or (2) when these differ systematically from the overall market (selection bias). Relative to the number of properties sold on the market, a much greater number of properties have borrowers who need to make monthly mortgage payment decisions. Therefore, each month borrowers cast a vote of confidence or no confidence in their price relative to the loan balance. Based on this behavior, we invert the relation between mortgage performance and prices to derive a latent price index. Using a large sample of individual mortgages across the 10 cities investigated, the latent index in each city has a high correlation with the respective Case-Shiller index. In addition, the latent index is partially explained by the housing expectations (derived from futures on the respective Case-Shiller index) which indicates that it is not a purely reactive measure. Overall the results show that the latent index has potential to boost information resources for tracking the important real estate sector.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122589', 'afid': '60122589', 'affilname': 'E.

Ability to model the probability of individual house sales would be of benefit in a number of real estate contexts. Existing housing literature models the probability of a house sale using mainly property characteristics or macroeconomic variables. However, the use of only property characteristics typically yields a poor model fit. This study investigates the relative roles of property characteristics, seller mortgage origination variables, and locational factors in terms of explaining the probability of individual house sales. Homeowner information such as their time horizon of staying in the house and their stage in the life cycle should have an important impact on house sale decisions. Although obtaining such information is typically difficult, mortgage choices made at loan origination may help reveal such information. In addition, the measurable characteristics of neighbors and the geographic clustering of house sales, ceteris paribus, may aid in modeling house sales. Incorporating the property characteristics, mortgage origination variables, and locational factors increases the pseudo-R2 of a probit model from under 1 percent when only using property characteristics to over 23 percent when using property, mortgage, and spatial information. The results are consistent through a particularly large housing cycle in both Las Vegas County in Nevada and Maricopa County in Arizona from 2006 to 2010, and for a variety of sub samples.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pace R.', 'Zhu S.']","['7103233088', '35333407700']",House sale | Probability of house sale,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1051137718300640,1212112

Studies on how variables of community resilience to natural hazards interact as a system that affects the final resilience (i.e., their dynamical linkages) have rarely been conducted. Bayesian network (BN), which represents the interdependencies among variables in a graph while expressing the uncertainty in the form of probability distributions, offers an effective way to investigate the interactions among different resilience components and addresses the natural–human system as a whole. This article employs a BN to study the interdependencies of ten resilience variables and population change in the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) at the census block group scale. A genetic algorithm was used to identify an optimal BN where population change, a cumulative resilience indicator, was the target variable. The genetic algorithm yielded an optimized BN model with a cross-validation accuracy of 67 percent over a period of 906 generations. Six variables were found to have direct impacts on population change, including level of threat from coastal hazards, hazard damage, distance to coastline, employment rate, percentage of housing units built before 1970, and percentage of households with a female householder. The remaining four variables were indirect variables, including percentage agriculture land, percentage flood zone area, percentage owner-occupied house units, and population density. Each variable has a conditional probability table so that its impacts on the probability of population change can be evaluated as it propagates through the network. These probabilities could be used for scenario modeling to help inform policies to reduce vulnerability and enhance disaster resilience.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013791', 'afid': '60013791', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100360845', 'afid': '100360845', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cai H.', 'Lam N.S.N.', 'Zou L.', 'Qiang Y.']","['56797269800', '7101750709', '56797356100', '36242248900']",Bayesian network | community resilience | coupled natural-human system | Lower Mississippi River Basin | population recovery,,1427389,,,1212112

This book contains 14 articles selected from a special issue on the assessment of resilience and sustainability of the Mississippi River Delta as a coupled natural-human system. This effort is supported in part by a U. S. National Science Foundation grant. The goal of this book is to present some of the recent advances in research and research methodologies, major discoveries, and new understanding of the Mississippi River Delta, which represents one of the most challenging cases in finding the pathways for coastal resilience and sustainability because of the complexity of environmental and socioeconomic interactions. The articles are contributed by 39 researchers and they studied the deltaic system from five aspects including 1) riverine processes and sediment availability, 2) sediment deposition and land creation, 3) wetland loss, saltwater intrusion, and subsidence, 4) community resilience and planning, and 5) review and synthesis. As editors, by reviewing and putting these papers together, we have realized a major challenge in conducting an interdisciplinary assessment of resilience: How to identify a ""Common Threshold"" from different scientific disciplines for a highly nature-human intertwined river delta system? For instance, the threshold for sustaining a river delta in the view of physical sciences is different from that of social sciences. Such a common threshold would be a radical change and/or a collapse of a coupled natural-human delta system if nothing can be or will be done. Identifying the common threshold would help guide assessment and evaluation of the resilience of a CNH system as well as the feasibility and willingness of protecting the system's resilience. We hope this book will be a first step toward inspiring researchers from different disciplines to work closely together to solve real problems in sustaining precious river delta ecosystems across the globe.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Editorial,"['Xu Y.J.', 'Lam N.S.N.', 'Liu K.B.']","['7406451631', '7101750709', '7404199972']",Coupled natural-human system (CNH) | Gulf of Mexico | Mississippi River Delta | Resilience | River deltas | Sustainability,USDA,LAB94230,U.S. Department of Agriculture,,1212112

We discuss Monte Carlo methodology that can be used to explore alternative approaches to estimating spatial regression models. Our focus is on models that include spatial lags of the dependent variable, e.g., the SAR specification. A major point is that practitioners rely on scalar summary measures of direct and indirect effects estimates to interpret the impact of changes in explanatory variables on the dependent variable of interest. We argue that these should be the focus of Monte Carlo experiments. Since effects estimates reflect a nonlinear function of both β and ρ, past studies’ focus exclusively on β and ρ parameter estimates may not provide useful information regarding statistical properties of effects estimates produced by alternative estimators. Since effects estimates have recently become the focus of inference regarding the significance of (scalar summary) direct and indirect impacts arising from changes in the explanatory variables, empirical measures of dispersion produced by simulating draws from the (estimated) variance–covariance matrix of the parameters β and ρ should be part of the Monte Carlo study. An implication is that differences in the quality of estimated variance–covariance matrices arising from alternative estimators also plays a role in determining the accuracy of inference. An applied illustration is used to demonstrate how these issues can impact conclusions regarding the performance of alternative estimators.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030452', 'afid': '60030452', 'affilname': 'Texas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Marcos', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['LeSage J.', 'Pace R.']","['26643220200', '57193698545']",Estimated variance–covariance matrices | Simulation of scalar summary direct and indirect effects | Spatial autoregressive models,NSF,1212112,National Science Foundation,,1212112

Large Mississippi River (MR) diversions (peak water flow >1416 m3/s and sediment loads >165 kg/s) have been proposed as part of a suite of coastal restoration projects and are expected to rehabilitate and rebuild wetlands to alleviate the significant historic wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. These coastal wetlands are undergoing increasing eustatic sea-level rise, land subsidence, climate change, and anthropogenic disturbances. However, the effect of MR diversions on wetland soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in receiving basins remains unknown. The rate of SOC sequestration or carbon burial in wetlands is one of the variables used to assess the role of wetland soils in carbon cycling and also to construct wetland carbon budgets. In this study, we examined the effects of MR water and sediment diversions on landscape-scale SOC sequestration rates that were estimated from vertical accretion for the next 50 yr (2010–2060) under two environmental (moderate and less optimistic) scenarios. Our analyses were based on model simulations taken from the Wetland Morphology model developed for Louisiana’s 2012 Coastal Master Plan. The master plan modeled a “future-without-action” scenario as well as eight individual MR diversion projects in two of the hydrologic basins (Barataria and Breton Sound). We examined the effects that discharge rates (peak flow) and locations of these individual diversion projects had on SOC sequestration rates. Modeling results indicate that large river diversions are capable of improving basin-wide SOC sequestration capacity (162–222 g Cm2yr1) by up to 14% (30 g Cm2yr1) in Louisiana deltaic wetlands compared to the future-without-action scenario, especially under the less optimistic scenario. When large river diversions are placed in the upper receiving basin, SOC sequestration rates are 3.7–10.5% higher (6–24 g Cm2yr1) than when these structures are placed in the lower receiving basin. Modeling results also indicate that both diversion discharge and location have large effects on SOC sequestration in low-salinity (freshwater and intermediate marshes) as compared to high-salinity marshes (brackish and saline marshes).",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015161', 'afid': '60015161', 'affilname': 'University of Louisiana at Lafayette', 'affiliation-city': 'Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003631', 'afid': '60003631', 'affilname': 'Western Washington University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bellingham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wang H.', 'Steyer G.', 'Couvillion B.', 'Beck H.', 'Rybczyk J.', 'Rivera-Monroy V.', 'Krauss K.', 'Visser J.']","['7501733919', '6604009489', '48861192200', '55779771800', '6602740025', '6603286088', '7007182997', '7202086473']",Barataria basin | Breton sound basin | Louisiana | Mississippi river | Sea-level rise | Sediment diversion | Soil organic carbon sequestration | Subsidence | Vertical accretion,USGS,undefined,U.S. Geological Survey,,1212112

The hydrological and environmental histories of estuarine wetlands in southern Louisiana are not well-documented. To better understand their local developmental processes, a 59 cm sediment core (WMA-1) was extracted from a bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamp located approximately 800 m west of Lake Pontchartrain. This area has been heavily influenced by human activities, and is susceptible to inundation from storm surges from Lake Pontchartrain as well as fluvial and lacustrine processes. 210Pb analysis indicates that WMA-1 has a sedimentation rate of 0.39 cm/year, consistent with the detection of a 137Cs peak at 18 cm depth. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses reveal two distinct sedimentological facies: an organic-rich dark brown peat unit from 0 to 29 cm containing low concentrations of terrestrial elements (e.g., Ti, and Fe), and a clay unit from 29 to 59 cm with elevated concentrations of most elements (e.g., Sr, Cl, Ti, Mn, and Fe). The pollen assemblage in the clay section is dominated by TCT (mainly Taxodium), but it is replaced by Salix and wetland herbaceous taxa in the overlying peat. The Taxodium swamp was present at the site at least 150 years ago, and was replaced by Salix and other bottomland hardwood trees and wetland herbs due to a decrease in water level around AD 1940. While climate may have played a role, this hydrological change was most likely caused by the significant regional human activities during the last 100 years. Two thin clay layers (at 3-5 cm, 14-19 cm) embedded in the upper peat section were likely deposited from hurricanes Isaac (2012) and Betsy (1969): two events responsible for heavy rain and significant storm-surge flooding. Our findings suggest that human activities are capable of altering local wetland hydrology and ecology, while the clay layers represent hurricane-induced floods at the site during the past century.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Conference Paper,"['Ryu J.', 'Bianchette T.', 'Liu K.', 'Yao Q.', 'Maiti K.']","['57203361952', '43561110000', '7404199972', '55272651900', '16316774100']",environmental history | estuarine wetlands | human activities | hurricanes | loss-onignition | pollen | sediment | Taxodium | XRF,NSF,CNH-1212112,National Science Foundation,,1212112

Coastal Louisiana has been facing a serious land loss problem over the past several decades, and extensive research has been undertaken to address the problem. However, the importance of landscape fragmentation on land loss has seldom been examined. This paper evaluates the effects of landscape fragmentation on land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Basin region. The research hypothesis is that the higher the degree of fragmentation in a locality, the greater the amount of land loss in the next time period. We used Landsat-TM data with a pixel size of 30 m × 30 m in 1996 and 2010 and transformed the images into either land or water pixels. We then calculated the fractal dimension and Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistics and used them to represent the degree of landscape fragmentation. Four sample box sizes, including sizes of 101 × 101, 71 × 71, 51 × 51, and 31 × 31 pixels, were used to detect if there is a relationship between fragmentation and land loss at different neighborhood (context) scales. For each box size, 100 samples were randomly selected. To isolate the fragmentation effect so that it can be better evaluated, we used only sample boxes with a 50% land-water ratio. Regression results between fragmentation and land loss show that the R2 values for box sizes of 71 × 71, 51 × 51 and 31 × 31 were statistically significant (0.20, 0.45, 0.35; p < 0.001 for Moran's I) but not for the 101 × 101 box size. These results imply that land protection may be most effective by prioritizing areas with land patches that have the least fragmentation. Furthermore, the neighborhood scale at which the R2 value is the highest indicates the scale at which the effects are most likely to be observed (51 × 51 box size, approximately 1.5 × 1.5 km2, R2 = 0.45), which suggests that future land loss modeling using this neighborhood scale would be most effective.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lam N.', 'Cheng W.', 'Zou L.', 'Cai H.']","['7101750709', '57200970174', '56797356100', '56797269800']",Coastal land loss | Fractal dimension | Landscape fragmentation | Mississippi River Delta | Scale and context effects | Spatial autocorrelation,NSF,1427389,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0034425717306181,1212112

The Mississippi River Delta has been continuously losing land since the 1930s due to several factors, chief of which is the reduced sediment supply. A few recent studies have estimated individual components of short-term sediment transport, i.e.; bedload and suspended load, separately for some locations along the Lowermost Mississippi River (LmMR, commonly considered as the last 500-km reach of the Mississippi River before entering the Gulf of Mexico). However, the combined effects of both components on the long-term sediment supply along the river reach are still unclear. One of the major obstacles here hindering our understanding is that it is difficult and impractical to accurately measure bedloads in large alluvial rivers, such as the Mississippi. In this study, we estimated bedloads of three medium grain sizes (D50 = 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mm) for three locations along the uppermost 140-km reach of the LmMR: Tarbert Landing (TBL) at river kilometer (rk) 493, St Francisville (St F) at rk 419, and Baton Rouge (BTR) at rk 367.5 during 2004-2015. We also estimated suspended loads at St F during 1978-2015 and at BTR during 2004-2015 in order to discern the interactive relationship between bedloads and suspended loads. We found gradually increasing bedloads for all the three medium grain sizes from TBL (83, 41.5 and 20.75 million tons (MT), respectively) to BTR (96, 48 and 24 MT). We also found that suspended loads at TBL (reported previously) were significantly higher than those at St F and BTR during corresponding overlapping periods. Bedloads increased almost linearly with suspended loads, river discharge and river stage at the upstream locations (TBL and St F); however, such a relationship was not evident downstream at BTR. The total sediment load (bedload + suspended sediment load) was substantially higher at TBL (931 MT), while lower and nearly equal at other two downstream locations (550 MT at St F and 544 MT at BTR) during 2004-2010 (the matching period of availability of both loads). These findings indicate that the uppermost 20-25 km LmMR reach (covering TBL) has potentially entrapped substantial suspended load over the last three to four decades, while bedload transport prevails in the lower reach (covering St F and BTR).We suggest that future sediment management in the river should seek engineering solutions for moving trapped coarse sediments downstream towards the coast for the Mississippi River Delta restoration.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013610', 'afid': '60013610', 'affilname': 'LSU Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Joshi S.', 'Xu Y.J.']","['57037696300', '7406451631']",Bedload | Daily discharge and river stage | Lowermost Mississippi River | Sediment transport | Suspended load,NSF,1212112,National Science Foundation,,1212112

All Rights Reserved. Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic, interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human elements. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences. Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective academic-practitioner collaborations.",28,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122540', 'afid': '60122540', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins Carey Business School', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027202', 'afid': '60027202', 'affilname': 'Resources For The Future Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ferraro P.', 'Sanchirico J.', 'Smith M.']","['7005745384', '6603128224', '15037909900']",Bioeconomics | Marine protected areas | Quasiexperiment | Social-ecological systems | Spatial dynamics,NSF,CNH 1715638,National Science Foundation,,1715638

Shifts in the frequency of typical meteorological patterns in an ocean basin, over interannual to decadal time scales, cause shifts in the patterns of wave generation. Therefore, ocean basin-scale climate shifts produce shifts in the wave climates affecting the coastlines of the basin. We present a hybrid methodology for downscaling observed (or predicted) climate shifts into local nearshore wave climates and then into the associated coastline responses. A series of statistical analyses translate observed (or predicted) distributions of meteorological states into the deep water wave climate affecting a coastal region and dynamical modeling combined with statistical analyses transform the deep water wave climate into the nearshore wave climate affecting a particular coastline. Finally, dynamical modeling of coastline evolution hindcasts (or predicts) how coastline shapes respond to climate shifts. As a case study, we downscale from meteorological hindcast in the North Atlantic basin since 1870 to the responses of the shape of the coast of the Carolinas, USA. We test the hindcasts using shoreline change rates calculated from historical shorelines, because shifts in coastline shape equate to changes in the alongshore pattern of shoreline change rates from one historical period to another. Although limited by the availability of historical shorelines (and complicated by historical inlet openings), the observations are consistent with the predicted signal of ocean basin-scale climate change. The hybrid downscaling methodology, applied to the output of global climate models, can be used to help forecast future patterns of shoreline change related to future climate change scenarios.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015179', 'afid': '60015179', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Cantabria', 'affiliation-city': 'Santander', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Antolínez J.', 'Murray A.', 'Méndez F.', 'Moore L.', 'Farley G.', 'Wood J.']","['57151439900', '57192172539', '7101990242', '7401847647', '57200607288', '57200603329']",alongshore sediment transport | climate change | hybrid downscaling | large scale | shoreline evolution | wave climate variability,,BOE-A-2013-12235,National Science Foundation,,1715638

As sea level rises and storm frequency and severity increase, communities worldwide are investing in coastline management projects to maintain beach widths and dunes that support recreational amenities and mitigate storm risks. These projects are costly, and differences in property owners’ returns from maintaining wide beaches will influence community-level support for investment in shoreline defense. One way to account for these differences is by funding the project through a tax instrument that imposes the heaviest cost on residents who benefit most from beach nourishment. Some communities along the US east coast have adopted this approach. We use an agent-based model to evaluate how the imposition of project costs affects coastline management over the long-term. Charging higher tax rates on oceanfront properties reduces desired beach width among those owners but increases desired width for owners of inland properties. The aggregate impact on beach width depends on coastline shape and development patterns that determine the balance between these two groups, heterogeneity of beach width preferences and climate change beliefs, and levels of participation in local politics. Overall, requiring property owners who benefit most from beach nourishment to bear the highest cost results in wider beaches. The result suggests that delineating tax rates to account for unequal benefits of local public goods across taxpayers could facilitate local investment in climate change adaptation.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029194', 'afid': '60029194', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina Wilmington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wilmington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mullin M.', 'Smith M.', 'McNamara D.']","['35943452300', '15037909900', '20735126400']",Adaptation | Beach nourishment | Climate change | Local politics | Public finance,NSF,CNH 1715638,National Science Foundation,,1715638

Most existing coastal climate-adaptation planning processes, and the research supporting them, tightly focus on how to use land use planning, policy tools, and infrastructure spending to reduce risks from rising seas and changing storm conditions. While central to community response to sea level rise, we argue that the exclusive nature of this focus biases against and delays decisions to take more discontinuous, yet proactive, actions to adapt—for example, relocation and aggressive individual protection investments. Public policies should anticipate real estate market responses to risk reduction to avoid large costs—social and financial—when and if sea level rise and other climate-related factors elevate the risks to such high levels that discontinuous responses become the least bad alternative.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029194', 'afid': '60029194', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina Wilmington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wilmington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016280', 'afid': '60016280', 'affilname': 'East Carolina University', 'affiliation-city': 'Greenville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116110680', 'afid': '116110680', 'affilname': 'UNC Coastal Studies Institute', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Note,"['Keeler A.', 'McNamara D.', 'Irish J.']","['6603592444', '20735126400', '7101847405']",adaptation | erosion | policy | risk reduction | sea level rise | storm,NSF,1735139,National Science Foundation,,1715638

Considerable effort using techniques developed in statistical physics has been aimed at numerical simulations of agent-based opinion models and analysis of their results. Such work has elucidated how various rules for interacting agents can give rise to steady state behaviors in the agent populations that vary between consensus and fragmentation. At the macroscopic population level, analysis has been limited due to the lack of an analytically tractable governing macro-equation for the continuous population state. We use the integro-differential equation that governs opinion dynamics for the continuous probability distribution function of agent opinions to develop a novel nonlinear partial differential equation for the evolution of opinion distributions. The highly nonlinear equation allows for the generation of a system of approximations. We consider three initial population distributions and determine their small-time behavior. Our analysis reveals how the generation of clusters results from the interplay of diffusion and anti-diffusion and how initial instabilities arise in different regions of the population distribution.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029194', 'afid': '60029194', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina Wilmington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wilmington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Alexanian M.', 'McNamara D.']","['6603337551', '20735126400']",,,EAR 1715638,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378437118311026,1715638

Changing climate, social institutions, and natural resource management policies are reshaping the dynamics of social-ecological systems globally, with subsistence-based communities likely to be among the most vulnerable to the impacts of global change. These communities’ local ecological knowledge is increasingly recognized as a source of adaptive capacity for them as well as a crucial source of information to be incorporated into scientific understanding and policy making. We interviewed Tibetan pastoralists about their observations of environmental changes, their interpretations of the causes of these changes, and the ways in which they acquire and transmit this knowledge. We found that community members tended to agree that changing climate is driving undesirable trends in grassland and livestock health, and some also viewed changing management practices as compounding the impacts of climate change. However, those nominated by their peers as experts on traditional, pastoral knowledge observed fewer changes than did a more heterogeneous group of people who reported more ways in which the environment is changing. Herders mostly discussed these changes among themselves and particularly with village leaders, yet people who discussed environmental changes together did not necessarily hold the same knowledge of them. These results indicate that members of the community are transferring knowledge of environmental change primarily as a means for seeking adaptive solutions to it, rather than for learning from others, and that local leaders can serve as critical brokers of knowledge transfer within and beyond their communities. This highlights not only the interconnectedness of knowledge, practice, and power, but also points toward the important role that local governance can have in helping communities cope with the impacts of global change.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001742', 'afid': '60001742', 'affilname': 'Tibet University', 'affiliation-city': 'Lhasa', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hopping K.', 'Yangzong C.', 'Klein J.']","['55331046100', '57188744447', '36070647100']",Cultural consensus analysis | Global change | Local ecological knowledge | Pastoralism | Social networks | Tibetan plateau,,undefined,,,1414106

Glacierized mountains are often referred to as our world's water towers because glaciers both store water over time and regulate seasonal stream flow, releasing runoff during dry seasons when societies most need water. Ice loss thus has the potential to affect human societies in diverse ways, including irrigation, agriculture, hydropower, potable water, livelihoods, recreation, spirituality, and demography. Unfortunately, research focusing on the human impacts of glacier runoff variability in mountain regions remains limited, and studies often rely on assumptions rather than concrete evidence about the effects of shrinking glaciers on mountain hydrology and societies. This article provides a systematic review of international research on human impacts of glacier meltwater variability in mountain ranges worldwide, including the Andes, Alps, greater Himalayan region, Cascades, and Alaska. It identifies four main areas of existing research: (1) socioeconomic impacts; (2) hydropower; (3) agriculture, irrigation, and food security; and (4) cultural impacts. The article also suggests paths forward for social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences research that could more accurately detect and attribute glacier runoff and human impacts, grapple with complex and intersecting spatial and temporal scales, and implement transdisciplinary research approaches to study glacier runoff. The objective is ultimately to redefine and reorient the glacier-water problem around human societies rather than simply around ice and climate. By systematically evaluating human impacts in different mountain regions, the article strives to stimulate cross-regional thinking and inspire new studies on glaciers, hydrology, risk, adaptation, and human–environment interactions in mountain regions.",28,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030840', 'afid': '60030840', 'affilname': 'Københavns Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Copenhagen', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013997', 'afid': '60013997', 'affilname': 'Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Carey M.', 'Molden O.', 'Rasmussen M.', 'Jackson M.', 'Nolin A.', 'Mark B.']","['41861091700', '57191861853', '55255903400', '14421189700', '7004377842', '7005209721']",climate change impacts | glacier runoff variability | glacier–society interactions | hydrosocial cycle | water sustainability,,undefined,,,1414106

Particular emphasis is given to the context-sensitivity of social-cultural concepts in decision-making. These aspects are translated into a conceptual model aiming not to replace but to expand and enhance existing frameworks.

Some label ES as “boundary objects” that help integrate diverse forms of knowledge across social groups and organizational scales. However, this classification masks complexities that arise from unique characteristics of ES types (i.e., provisioning, regulating, and cultural), which influence their ability to function as boundary objects. We argue that interpretive flexibility and material structures interact in distinct ways across ES types throughout a boundary object “life cycle.” Viewing a 2015 U.S. federal memorandum as a catalyst, we critically evaluate the evolution of ES and its role as a boundary object. We propose that provisioning and regulating services are transitioning out of boundary object status, moving into a more standardized state. However, we anticipate that cultural services may continue to behave as boundary objects if collaborators maintain them as such. This shift in the functionality of ES as boundary objects is an important consideration for future research that attempts to reach across social worlds and disciplinary perspectives. We urge collaborations to rely on the most relevant disciplinary knowledge, rather than allowing the ease of standardized solutions to dictate the boundary of a given problem.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071539', 'afid': '60071539', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Rio Piedras', 'affiliation-city': 'San Juan', 'affiliation-country': 'Puerto Rico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033389', 'afid': '60033389', 'affilname': 'University of Idaho', 'affiliation-city': 'Moscow', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024063', 'afid': '60024063', 'affilname': 'University of Massachusetts Boston', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023908', 'afid': '60023908', 'affilname': 'Portland State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Portland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254', 'afid': '60009254', 'affilname': 'Purdue University', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Steger C.', 'Hirsch S.', 'Evers C.', 'Branoff B.', 'Petrova M.', 'Nielsen-Pincus M.', 'Wardropper C.', 'van Riper C.']","['57190866479', '57193370553', '56998423400', '55839091700', '57200684567', '15822262200', '56495415800', '24336626100']",Boundary objects | Collaboration | Cultural services | Provisioning services | Regulating services | Standards | Transdisciplinary research,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0921800917304664,1414106

The Tibetan Plateau has the largest expanse of high-elevation permafrost in the world, and it is experiencing climate warming that may jeopardize the functioning of its alpine ecosystems. Many studies have focused on the effects of climate warming on vegetation production and diversity on the Plateau, but their disparate results have hindered a comprehensive, regional understanding. From a synthesis of twelve warming experiments across the Plateau, we found that warming increased aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and vegetation height at sites with permafrost, but ANPP decreased with warming at non-permafrost sites. Aboveground net primary production responded more negatively to warming under drier conditions, due to both annual drought conditions and warming-induced soil moisture loss. Decreases in species diversity with warming were also larger at sites with permafrost. These results support the emerging understanding that water plays a central role in the functioning of cold environments and suggest that as ecosystems cross a threshold from permafrost to non-permafrost systems, ANPP will decrease across a greater proportion of the Tibetan Plateau. This study also highlights the future convergence of challenges from permafrost degradation and grassland desertification, requiring new collaborations among these currently distinct research and stakeholder groups.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020259', 'afid': '60020259', 'affilname': 'Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Chengdu', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977', 'afid': '60003977', 'affilname': 'Northwestern Polytechnical University', 'affiliation-city': ""Xi'an"", 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yang Y.', 'Hopping K.', 'Wang G.', 'Chen J.', 'Peng A.', 'Klein J.']","['36562826700', '55331046100', '57201898744', '55204725200', '57194614724', '36070647100']",aboveground net primary production (ANPP) | alpine grasslands | climate change | desertification | diversity | mountains | permafrost | plant height | production | synthesis | Tibetan Plateau | water availability,NSFC,41271224,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,1414106

As multiple UN policy frameworks stress, DRR is crucial to mitigate the mounting environmental and socioeconomic costs of disasters globally. However, specialized DRR guidelines are needed for biodiverse, multi-hazard regions like mountains. Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) emphasizes ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable management as key elements for DRR. We propose that integrating the emerging field of Eco-DRR with community-based DRR (CB-DRR) will help address the increasing vulnerabilities of mountain people and ecosystems. Drawing on a global mountain synthesis, we present paradoxes that create challenges for DRR in mountains and examine these paradoxes through examples from the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. We propose four principles for integrated CB- and Eco-DRR that address these challenges: (1) governance and institutional arrangements that fit local needs; (2) empowerment and capacity-building to strengthen community resilience; (3) discovery and sharing of constructive practices that combine local and scientific knowledge; and (4) approaches focused on well-being and equity. We illustrate the reinforcing relationship between integrated CB- and Eco-DRR principles with examples from other mountain systems worldwide. Coordinated community and ecosystem-based actions offer a potential path to achieve DRR, climate adaptation, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation for vulnerable ecosystems and

To determine the resilience of complex social-ecological systems (SESs) it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the system behavior under changing political, economic, and environmental conditions (i.e., external system stressors). Such behavior can be predicted if one knows the stable and unstable equilibrium states in a system and how these equilibria react to changes in the system stressors. The state of the system rapidly or gradually changes either toward (i.e., stable equilibrium) or away from (i.e., unstable equilibrium) an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium states in a SES are often unknown and difficult to identify in real systems. In contrast, agent-based SES models can potentially be used to determine equilibria states, but are rarely used for this purpose. We developed a generic approach to identify stable and unstable equilibria states with agent-based SES models. We used an agent-based SES model to simulate land-use change in an alpine mountain region in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. By iteratively running this model for different input settings, we were able to identify equilibria in intensive and extensive agriculture. We also assessed the sensitivity of these equilibria to changes in external system stressors. With support-vector machine classifications, we created bifurcation diagrams in which the stable and unstable equilibria as a function of the values of a system stressor were depicted. The external stressors had a strong influence on the equilibrium states. We also found that a minimum amount of direct payments was necessary for agricultural extensification to take place. Our approach does not only provide valuable insights into the resilience of our case-study region to changing conditions, but can also be applied to other (agent-based) SES models to present important model results in a condensed and understandable format.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025858', 'afid': '60025858', 'affilname': 'ETH Zürich', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich ZH,', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123002614', 'afid': '123002614', 'affilname': 'Flury &amp; Giuliani agricultural and regional economic consulting', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}]",Journal,Article,"['Van Strien M.', 'Huber S.', 'Anderies J.', 'Grêt-Regamey A.']","['55190646500', '57207583948', '6603314876', '16024264700']",Agricultural land use | Bifurcation diagram | Land-use change | Regime shift,SNSF,undefined,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,,1414106

We analyze the invisibility of fisheries and inadequacy of fishers’ participation in the process of hydropower development in the Amazon, focusing on gaps between legally mandated and actual outcomes. Using Ostrom’s institutional design principles for assessing common-pool resource management, we selected five case studies from Brazilian Amazonian watersheds to conduct an exploratory comparative case-study analysis. We identify similar problems across basins, including deficiencies in the dam licensing process; critical data gaps; inadequate stakeholder participation; violation of human rights; neglect of fishers’ knowledge; lack of organization and representation by fishers’ groups; and lack of governmental structure and capacity to manage dam construction activities or support fishers after dam construction. Fishers have generally been marginalized or excluded from decision-making regarding planning, construction, mitigation, compensation, and monitoring of the social–ecological impacts of hydroelectric dams. Addressing these deficiencies will require concerted investments and efforts by dam developers, government agencies and civil society, and the promotion of inter-sectorial dialogue and cross-scale participatory planning and decision-making that includes fishers and their associations.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024984', 'afid': '60024984', 'affilname': 'Fundacao Universidade Federal de Rondonia', 'affiliation-city': 'Porto Velho', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016746', 'afid': '60016746', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal do Tocantins', 'affiliation-city': 'Palmas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001890', 'afid': '60001890', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal do Para', 'affiliation-city': 'Belem', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000943', 'afid': '60000943', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal do Amazonas', 'affiliation-city': 'Manaus', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119888996', 'afid': '119888996', 'affilname': 'GSA Consulting Environment Ltda', 'affiliation-city': 'Manaus', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Doria C.', 'Athayde S.', 'Marques E.', 'Lima M.', 'Dutka-Gianelli J.', 'Ruffino M.', 'Kaplan D.', 'Freitas C.', 'Isaac V.']","['24576462400', '55325046100', '16679524500', '55620281600', '6507188261', '6603069518', '57209595471', '55126659400', '6603635810']",Amazon | Dams | Environmental policy | Fishers | Freshwater fisheries | Governance | Hydropower | Inland tropical fisheries | Licensing,CNPq,MALL 7487-14-2,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico,,1617413

These impacts are likely to be substantial given the wide geographic extent of the lines and the relatively high forest cover in the traversed areas. Publicly available information about the location and extent of the transmission line network in the Amazon is neither accurate nor current, and its environmental impacts on terrestrial ecosystems have not been assessed on a large scale. This study estimates the scale of the impact of the current and planned transmission and distribution line network using a hand-digitized dataset and the predicted impact area determined from Environmental Impact Assessments. The Legal Amazon region contains 39,625 km of verified transmission and distribution lines, estimated to directly impact 23,467 km2 of land. We find that the transmission line network directly impacts double the area flooded by hydroelectric reservoirs in the Legal Amazon. Of the direct impact area, 5.1% is within protected areas and 10.3% overlaps with intact forest. By 2026, the transmission line network is estimated to grow by 37% in the Legal Amazon, increasing the direct impact to forests by 70% and to protected lands by 29%.

Across the world, the assessment of environmental impacts attributable to infrastructure and development projects often require a comparison between observed post-impact outcomes with what “would have happened” in the absence of the impact (i.e., the counterfactual). Environmental impact assessment (EIA) methods traditionally determine the counterfactual based on strong assumptions of stationarity (e.g., using before and after comparisons) and can be particularly challenging to use in the context of substantial data gaps, a vexing problem when combining several time-series data from different sources. Here we propose and test a widely applicable statistical approach for quantifying environmental impacts that avoids the stationarity assumption and circumvents issues associated with data gaps. Specifically, we used a Gaussian Copula (GC) model to assess the hydrological impacts of the Tucuruí dam on the Tocantins River in the Brazilian Amazon. Using multi-source water level and climate data, GC predictions of pre-dam hydrology for the validation period were excellent (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.83 to 0.98 and 93–96% of observations within the 95% predictive intervals). In the post-dam period, the river had higher dry-season water levels both upstream and downstream relative to the predicted counterfactual, and the timing and duration of wet-season drawdown was delayed and extended, substantially altering the flood pulse. These impacts were evident as far as 176 km away from the dam, highlighting widespread hydrological impacts. The GC model outperformed standard multiple regression models in representing predictive uncertainty while also avoiding the stationarity assumption and circumventing the issue of sparse and incomplete data. We thus believe the GC approach has wide utility for integrating disparate time-series data to quantify the impacts of dams and other anthropogenic phenomena on riverine hydrology globally.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Valle D.', 'Kaplan D.']","['14040741200', '57209595471']",Amazon | Counterfactual | Dams | Data gap | Hydrologic alteration | Impact assessment | Sparse data | Stationarity,UF,undefined,University of Florida,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969719319229,1617413

Tropical river basins are experiencing major hydrological alterations as a result of climate variability and deforestation. These drivers of flow changes are often difficult to isolate in large basins based on either observations or experiments; however, combining these methods with numerical models can help identify the contribution of climate and deforestation to hydrological alterations. This paper presents a study carried out in the Tapajόs River (Brazil), a 477,000 km2 basin in South-eastern Amazonia, in which we analysed the role of annual land cover change on daily river flows. Analysis of observed spatial and temporal trends in rainfall, forest cover, and river flow metrics for 1976 to 2008 indicates a significant shortening of the wet season and reduction in river flows through most of the basin despite no significant trend in annual precipitation. Coincident with seasonal trends over the past 4 decades, over 35% of the original forest (140,000 out of 400,000 km2) was cleared. In order to determine the effects of land clearing and rainfall variability to trends in river flows, we conducted hindcast simulations with ED2 + R, a terrestrial biosphere model incorporating fine scale ecosystem heterogeneity arising from annual land-use change and linked to a flow routing scheme. The simulations indicated basin-wide increases in dry season flows caused by land cover transitions beginning in the early 1990s when forest cover dropped to 80% of its original extent. Simulations of historical potential vegetation in the absence of land cover transitions indicate that reduction in rainfall during the dry season (mean of −9 mm per month) would have had an opposite and larger magnitude effect than deforestation (maximum of +4 mm/month), leading to the overall net negative trend in river flows. In light of the expected increase in future climate variability and water infrastructure development in the Amazon and other tropical basins, this study presents an approach for analysing how multiple drivers of change are altering regional hydrology and water resources management.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103695', 'afid': '60103695', 'affilname': 'European Commission Joint Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Brussels', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013494', 'afid': '60013494', 'affilname': ""Università Ca' Foscari Venezia"", 'affiliation-city': 'Venice', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009982', 'afid': '60009982', 'affilname': 'Harvard University', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005405', 'afid': '60005405', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal de Alagoas', 'affiliation-city': 'Maceio', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002442', 'afid': '60002442', 'affilname': 'Universities Space Research Association', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbia', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Arias M.', 'Lee E.', 'Farinosi F.', 'Pereira F.', 'Moorcroft P.']","['23011471800', '56767302800', '55368902400', '55967077800', '6603194146']",ecosystem demography model | land cover dynamics | southeastern Amazonia | Tapajόs river,,undefined,,,1617413

Amazonian rivers are characterized by a strongly seasonal flood pulse, which is being altered by ongoing and planned hydropower development across the basin. Changes in hydrology have a cascade of physical, ecological, and social effects, and some ecohydrological changes in the Amazon are expected to be irreversible. To better understand these linkages, we investigated shared trends and causal factors driving fish catch in a major Amazonian tributary before dam construction to derive relationships between catch and natural hydrologic dynamics that can be used to assess likely post-dam fisheries impacts. We applied a time series-based dimension reduction technique (dynamic factor analysis) to investigate dynamics in fish catch across 10 commercially important species using daily fish landings and hydrological data. We found a 4-trend dynamic factor model to best fit the observed data, with fitted trends exhibiting variation representative of seasonal and longer-term hydrologic variation. We next considered 11 candidate explanatory time series and found the best dynamic factor model used 4 explanatory variables: maximum water level, flooding duration, previous year's flow, and rate of change in flow; however, each species showed a unique response to this set of hydrological variables.

Developing countries around the world are expanding hydropower to meet growing energy demand. In the Brazilian Amazon, >200 dams are planned over the next 30 years, and questions about the impacts of current and future hydropower in this globally important watershed remain unanswered. In this context, we applied a hydrologic indicator method to quantify how existing Amazon dams have altered the natural flow regime and to identify predictors of alteration. The type and magnitude of hydrologic alteration varied widely by dam, but the largest changes were to critical characteristics of the flood pulse. Impacts were largest for low-elevation, large-reservoir dams; however, small dams had enormous impacts relative to electricity production. Finally, the “cumulative” effect of multiple dams was significant but only for some aspects of the flow regime.

Glucocorticoid (GC) release into the environment has led to widespread detection of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity in water resources that has been shown to persist throughout conventional and some advanced wastewater treatment processes. Here, we used high performance liquid chromatography, high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore the reaction of natural (cortisone, cortisol) and synthetic (prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone) GCs with free chlorine (HOCl) to simulate their fate during chemical disinfection of water and wastewater. Generally, GCs react slowly (t1/2 ∼ 7-200 h) with HOCl when compared to other steroid classes, but they yield complex mixtures of transformation products, with at times the majority of product mass comprising structurally identifiable and likely bioactive steroids. For example, we frequently observed chlorination at the C-9 position (e.g., 9-chloro-prednisone), a reaction known to increase GC activity 4-fold. We also identified reaction products in the adrenosterone family of androgens produced via cleavage of the C-17 side-chain on many GCs. Another common transformation pathway was the conversion of endogenous GCs to their more potent synthetic analogs via oxidation at the C-1/C-2 positions, with unsaturation reported to increase GR activity 4-fold (e.g., cortisol to prednisolone). Despite identification of such products, in vitro assays generally suggest GR activity decreases with extent of parent decay during chlorination. Cortisol was the exception, with GR activity only decreasing 2-fold in product mixtures (based on measured EC50 values) despite a 95% reduction in parent concentration, a result attributable to formation of the more potent prednisolone during chlorination. Furthermore, our assay likely underestimates product bioactivity as it did not account for the activity of several identified GC byproducts that first require in vivo activation via C-11 reduction, nor did it consider androgen receptor (AR) activity associated with byproducts from the adrenosterone family. To avoid formation of product mixtures with conserved bioactivity, advanced chemical oxidation processes may represent a more promising approach; we show that GCs react much more rapidly with ozone (t1/2 ∼ 0.4-1.3 min) and produce no observable UV-active products. This suggests disruption of the GC conjugated π-electron and ring systems, thereby likely mitigating biological activity.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029526', 'afid': '60029526', 'affilname': 'University of California, Riverside', 'affiliation-city': 'Riverside', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024324', 'afid': '60024324', 'affilname': 'University of Iowa', 'affiliation-city': 'Iowa City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pflug N.', 'Kupsco A.', 'Kolodziej E.', 'Schlenk D.', 'Teesch L.', 'Gloer J.', 'Cwiertny D.']","['57188664809', '56208670400', '6602529247', '7006018368', '6602287998', '7005713603', '9238934200']",,NSF,2015SC101G,National Science Foundation,,1608464

Potent trienone and dienone steroid hormones undergo a coupled photohydration (in light)-thermal dehydration (in dark) cycle that ultimately increases their environmental persistence. Here, we studied the photolysis of dienogest, a dienone progestin prescribed as a next-generation oral contraceptive, and used high resolution mass spectrometry and both 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify its phototransformation products. Dienogest undergoes rapid direct photolysis (t1/2 ∼ 1-10 min), forming complex photoproduct mixtures across the pH range examined (pH 2 to 7). Identified products include three photohydrates that account for ∼80% of the converted mass at pH 7 and revert back to parent dienogest in the absence of light. Notably, we also identified two estrogenic compounds produced via the A-ring aromatization of dienogest, evidence for a photochemically-induced increase in estrogenic activity in product mixtures. These results imply that dienogest will undergo complete and facile photolytic transformation in sunlit surface water, yet exhibit greater environmental persistence than might be anticipated by inspection of kinetic rates. Photoproduct mixtures also include transformation products with different nuclear receptor binding capabilities than the parent compound dienogest. These outcomes reveal a dynamic fate and biological risk profile for dienogest that must also take into account the composition and endocrine activity of its transformation products. Collectively, this study further illustrates the need for more holistic regulatory, risk assessment, and monitoring approaches for high potency synthetic pharmaceuticals and their bioactive transformation products.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024324', 'afid': '60024324', 'affilname': 'University of Iowa', 'affiliation-city': 'Iowa City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009635', 'afid': '60009635', 'affilname': 'University of St. Thomas, Minnesota', 'affiliation-city': 'Saint Paul', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006602', 'afid': '60006602', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Tacoma', 'affiliation-city': 'Tacoma', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pflug N.', 'Hankard M.', 'Berg S.', ""O'Connor M."", 'Gloer J.', 'Kolodziej E.', 'Cwiertny D.', 'Wammer K.']","['57188664809', '57197749146', '57190275114', '57190299311', '7005713603', '6602529247', '9238934200', '8577563900']",,NSF,CBET-1335711,National Science Foundation,,1608464

Hybrid terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems in the Andes, commonly known as bofedales, consist of both peatlands and wet meadows and line valley floors at elevations > 3800 m. Compared with similar ecosystems at lower altitudes and higher latitudes, the ecosystem processes and spatial patterns of bofedales are only just beginning to be understood. The research presented here provides the first exploratory and descriptive analysis of the biodiversity and place-to-place variation of vegetation in bofedales in three valleys inside Peru’s Huascarán National Park. Through vegetation surveys, we recorded 112 plant species in 29 families. Over a short geographical distance, a valley-to-valley comparison showed high dissimilarity in terms of species composition. Based on dominant life form and species composition, vegetation in bofedales can be grouped into five assemblages. Our preliminary analysis suggests that several abiotic factors could influence the floristic composition of bofedales: elevation, bulk density, percent organic matter, and cation exchange capacity. The findings of high valley-to-valley variation in species, soil and elevation influences may be useful to land managers of high mountain landscapes that are undergoing transformation related to glacier recession.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of indicators for rehabilitation practices in high mountain landscapes that were aimed at increasing grassland palatability and biomass accumulation. Focusing on the department of Huancavelica in Peru, the importance of rehabilitation practiced in this area involves the relationship of alpaca pastoralists and their need to produce wool. Overgrazing in this area has decreased the carrying capacity of the system, which may be problematic for continuing their present levels of grazing. Therefore, rehabilitation practices, including herbivory exclusion, exclusion with added irrigation, and exclusion with water collecting ditches, were installed to increase vegetation biomass and palatability of the vegetation. The effects of the rehabilitation practices were assessed using six indicators: vegetation coverage, species richness, Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, below and aboveground biomass, and soil organic matter, which were analyzed using mixed-effects models. The indicators show that some practices, such as exclusion and ditches, are positively affecting vegetation coverage while negatively affecting species richness. Additionally, biomass showed lower accumulation in areas not excluded from grazing. Therefore, although some of the treatments were initiated as recently as 2013, we can already observe changes in the indicators involving vegetation composition and structure. In the long term, these indicators may allow us to fully understand the effect of the rehabilitation practices on maintaining the carrying capacity of the system. Furthermore, the general approach should be widely applicable in other utilized landscapes.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002483', 'afid': '60002483', 'affilname': 'Universiteit van Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109713900', 'afid': '109713900', 'affilname': 'Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecoregion (CONDESAN)', 'affiliation-city': 'Quito', 'affiliation-country': 'Ecuador'}]",Journal,Article,"['Duchicela S.', 'Cuesta F.', 'Pinto E.', 'Gosling W.', 'Young K.']","['57207686788', '13410514600', '57205099838', '55881697700', '7402601230']",ecological indicators | grassland | overgrazing | pastoralism | rehabilitation | restoration,UNU-EHS,DEB-1617429,United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security,,1617429

The Bonneville Salt Flats (BSF) in Utah is a dynamic saline playa environment responding to natural and anthropogenic forces. Over the last century, the saline groundwater from below BSF has been harvested to produce potash via evaporative mining, mostly used as agricultural fertilizers, while the surface halite crust has provided a significant recreational site for land speed racing. Perceptions of changes in the salt crust through time have spurred debates about land use and management; however, little is known about the timescales of natural change as the salt crust responds to climatic parameters that drive flooding, evaporation, and desiccation (FED) cycles that control surface salt growth and dissolution. Climate data over the last ~ 30 years are examined to identify annual patterns in surface water balance at BSF to identify annual and seasonal climate constraints on FED cycles. Landsat satellite data from 1986 to the present are used to map the areal extent of the surface halite salt crust at BSF at the end of the desiccation season (between August 15 and October 30) annually. Overall, the observed area of the desiccation-stage BSF halite crust has varied from a maximum of 156 km2 in 1993 to a minimum of 72 km2 in 2014 with an overall trend of declining area of halite observed over the ~ 30 years of analysis. Climatic variables that influence FED cycles and seasonal salt dissolution and precipitation have also varied through this time period; however, the relationship between surface water fluxes and salt crust area do not clearly correlate, suggesting that other processes are influencing the extent of the salt. Intra-annual analyses of salt area and weather illustrate the importance of ponded surface water, wind events, and microtopography in shaping a laterally extensive but thin and ephemeral halite crust. Examination of annual to decadal changes in salt crust extent and environmental parameters at BSF provides insights into the processes driving change and the sustainability of land use in this dynamic environment.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025488', 'afid': '60025488', 'affilname': 'The University of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bowen B.', 'Kipnis E.', 'Raming L.']","['8550801500', '57196747045', '57192092592']",Bonneville Salt Flats | Evaporite basins | Halite | Playa | Surface processes,NSF,NNX13AB34A,University of Utah,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169555X17304129,1617473

In northern China, ladybeetles are the most common predators in the annual double-crop rotation system, where the dominant crops are wheat in the spring and maize and cotton in the summer. Land-use features at the landscape level affect ladybeetle populations in a number of ways, and our previous studies have estimated the effects of landscape composition on ladybeetles abundance in wheat and cotton fields in northern China. However, these landscape effects on ladybeetle abundance in maize remain insufficiently documented in this specific agro-ecosystem. We assessed the relationships between ladybeetle abundance and landscape composition at four spatial scales (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 km) in a summer maize system at the whorl stage (the main period for ladybeetle colonization). We found that both semi-natural habitats (woodlots and grasslands) and vegetation around water bodies increased the abundance of ladybeetles in maize fields, and maize area played a dilution effect on ladybeetle abundance in this crop. These non-crop habitats might serve as source of emigrants that disperse to maize fields. The smallest scale (0.5 km) studied was the most predictive spatial scale in this colonization period for ladybeetles. Propylaea japonica, the dominant ladybeetle, showed response to landscape variables in a similar way as the whole ladybeetle population did. These findings suggest that leaving some non-crop habitats and reducing human disturbance to this vegetation within a landscape will enhance ladybeetle abundance in maize fields. Consistent with our previous studies in wheat and cotton fields in the same system, maintaining the continuity in time and space of functional habitats was essential for the persistence of ladybeetle populations within the landscape. In the future, habitat management and landscape design to ensure resource continuity should be encouraged to maximize the conservation of ladybeetles in agricultural ecosystems in northern China.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088560', 'afid': '60088560', 'affilname': 'Xingjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Urumqi', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yang L.', 'Xu L.', 'Liu B.', 'Zhang Q.', 'Pan Y.', 'Li Q.', 'Li H.', 'Lu Y.']","['56962939700', '57195491449', '56127142700', '57201243832', '57204120437', '57205148614', '55358017900', '55351914200']",Agricultural landscape | Conservation biological control | Double-crop rotation system | Non-crop habitats | Population abundance | Predatory ladybeetle,NSFC,2017YFD0200400,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167880919300568,1518359

All rights reserved. This article discusses the conservation challenges of volant migratory transborder species and conservation governance primarily in North America. Many migratory species provide ecosystem service benefits to society. For example, insectivorous bats prey on crop pests and reduce the need for pesticides; birds and insects pollinate food plants; and birds afford recreational opportunities to hunters and birdwatchers. Migration is driven by the seasonal availability of resources; as resources in one area become seasonally scarce, individuals move to locations where resources have become seasonally abundant. The separation of the annual lifecycle means that species management and governance is often fractured across international borders. Because migratory species depend on habitat in different locations, their ability to provide ecosystem services in one area depends on the spatial subsidies, or support, provided by habitat and ecological processes in other areas. This creates telecouplings, or interconnections across geographic space, of areas such that impacts to the habitat of a migratory species in one location will affect the benefits enjoyed by people in other locations. Information about telecoupling and spatial subsidies can be used to craft new governance arrangements such as Payment for Ecosystem Services programs that target specific stakeholder groups and locations. We illustrate these challenges and opportunities with three North American case studies: the Duck Stamp Program, Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana), and monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus).",28,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023143', 'afid': '60023143', 'affilname': 'Tufts University', 'affiliation-city': 'Medford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016247', 'afid': '60016247', 'affilname': 'Brandeis University', 'affiliation-city': 'Waltham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Book Series,Review,"['López-Hoffman L.', 'Chester C.', 'Semmens D.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'Rodríguez-Mcgoffin M.', 'Merideth R.', 'Diffendorfer J.']","['14063828300', '8155949100', '9234898400', '6602516830', '57196082858', '6603570381', '6602404951']",Animal migration | Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) | Multinational biodiversity management | Nature's benefits to people | Spatial subsidies | Telecoupling,USGS,1518359,U.S. Geological Survey,,1518359

Using contingent valuation, we estimated willingness to pay (WTP) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States to protect habitat for Northern Pintails (hereafter pintails), a migratory waterfowl species that provides benefits to and requires habitat in the three countries. Our study contributes to research on spatial subsidies by measuring the value of migratory species habitat. While WTP to protect pintail habitat is highest in the household's own country, there also is substantial WTP to protect pintail habitat in the other two countries. Canadian households’ annual WTP is US$12 (all dollar values are in 2016 US dollars) to stabilize the pintail population in Canada, US$4 in Mexico, and US$5 in the U.S. Mexican households would pay US$8 in Mexico, US$5 in the U.S., and US$5 in Canada. U.S. households would pay US$28 in the U.S., US$18 in Canada, and US$16 in Mexico. WTP is statistically significantly higher in all three countries to increase the pintail population.

Most geographical regions are, however, not closed systems but are open and telecoupled with other regions, such that the use of ES in one location is dependent on ecosystem processes and ecological management in other locations. Interregional ES flows often affect national economies and may trigger issues of national security and global equity. To date, however, methodologies for assessing interregional flows of ES have been published in dispersed literature. This paper provides a three-step guidance for how to assess four different types of interregional ES flows (traded goods, passive biophysical flows, species migration and dispersal as well as information flows). This guidance is intended to complement national and regional ecosystem assessments. The three steps are to (i)define the goal and scope of interregional ES flow assessments, (ii)quantify the interregional ES flows using a tiered approach and (iii)interpret results in terms of uncertainties, consequences and governance options. We compile different indicators for assessing interregional ES flows and evaluate their suitability for national and regional ES assessments. Finally, to assess the implications of interregional ES flows for environmental sustainability and human well-being, we relate our flow indicators to the Sustainable Development Goals. This guidance towards systematic assessment of interregional ES flows provides a first step to measure and quantify externalised environmental costs and can contribute to the development of indicators to address interregional imbalances in trade, foreign policy and beyond.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60116084', 'afid': '60116084', 'affilname': 'Senckenberg Biodiversität und Klima Forschungszentrum', 'affiliation-city': 'Frankfurt am Main', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103695', 'afid': '60103695', 'affilname': 'European Commission Joint Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Brussels', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072202', 'afid': '60072202', 'affilname': 'Leuphana Universität Lüneburg', 'affiliation-city': 'Luneburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029507', 'afid': '60029507', 'affilname': 'Friedrich Schiller Universität Jena', 'affiliation-city': 'Jena', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161', 'afid': '60027161', 'affilname': 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev', 'affiliation-city': 'Beer Sheba', 'affiliation-country': 'Israel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023208', 'afid': '60023208', 'affilname': 'Universität Bayreuth', 'affiliation-city': 'Bayreuth', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018229', 'afid': '60018229', 'affilname': 'Helmholtz Zentrum für Umweltforschung', 'affiliation-city': 'Leipzig', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014059', 'afid': '60014059', 'affilname': 'Martin-Universität Halle-Wittenberg', 'affiliation-city': 'Halle', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008734', 'afid': '60008734', 'affilname': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008042', 'afid': '60008042', 'affilname': 'Universität Leipzig', 'affiliation-city': 'Leipzig', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}]",Journal,Article,"['Koellner T.', 'Bonn A.', 'Arnhold S.', 'Bagstad K.J.', 'Fridman D.', 'Guerra C.A.', 'Kastner T.', 'Kissinger M.', 'Kleemann J.', 'Kuhlicke C.', 'Liu J.', 'López-Hoffman L.', 'Marques A.', 'Martín-López B.', 'Schulp C.J.E.', 'Wolff S.', 'Schröter M.']","['57209008387', '6602394803', '55328696700', '36819113600', '57215776537', '7004786345', '35172987400', '57208560036', '57193673997', '12787469400', '57202270607', '14063828300', '56783638400', '23028283000', '12753879100', '56585394100', '54392158300']",Ecosystem services flows | Interregional | National ecosystem assessment,USGS,undefined,U.S. Geological Survey,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1470160X19302936,1518359

We estimated U.S. and Mexican citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for protecting habitat for a transborder migratory species, the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana), using the contingent valuation method. Few contingent valuation surveys have evaluated whether households in one country would pay to protect habitat in another country. This study addresses that gap. In our study, Mexican respondents were asked about their WTP for conservation of Mexican free-tailed bat habitat in Mexico and in the United States. Similarly, U.S. respondents were asked about their WTP for conservation in the United States and in Mexico. U.S. households would pay $30 annually to protect habitat in the United States and $24 annually to protect habitat in Mexico. Mexican households would pay $8 annually to protect habitat in Mexico and $5 annually to protect habitat in the United States. In both countries, these WTP amounts rose significantly for increasing the size of the bat population rather than simply stabilizing the current bat population. The ratio of Mexican household WTP relative to U.S. household WTP is nearly identical to that of Mexican household income relative to U.S. household income. This suggests that the perceived economic benefits received from the bats is similar in Mexico and the United States, and that scaling WTP by relative income in international benefit transfer may be plausible.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015574', 'afid': '60015574', 'affilname': 'The University of Tennessee, Knoxville', 'affiliation-city': 'Knoxville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114515644', 'afid': '114515644', 'affilname': 'Division of Migratory Bird Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Lakewood', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Haefele M.', 'Loomis J.', 'Merideth R.', 'Lien A.', 'Semmens D.', 'Dubovsky J.', 'Wiederholt R.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'Huang T.', 'McCracken G.', 'Medellin R.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'López-Hoffman L.']","['6507169710', '24590584400', '6603570381', '56814598500', '9234898400', '7004267660', '35932676600', '6602516830', '57201913339', '7201778127', '6604067105', '6602404951', '14063828300']",Bats | Contingent valuation | Habitat | Mexico | United States | Willingness to pay,NSF,DEB-1118975,National Science Foundation,,1518359

Drivers of environmental change in one location can have profound effects on ecosystem services and human well-being in distant locations, often across international borders. The telecoupling provides a conceptual framework for describing these interactions—for example, locations can be defined as sending areas (sources of flows of ecosystem services, energy, or information) or receiving areas (recipients of flows). However, the ability to quantify feedbacks between ecosystem change in one area and societal benefits in other areas requires analytical approaches. We use spatial subsidies—an approach developed to measure the degree to which a migratory species’ ability to provide services in one location depends on habitat in another location—as an example of how telecoupling can be operationalized. Using the cotton pest control and ecotourism services of Mexican free-tailed bats as an example, we determined that of the 16 states in the United States and Mexico where the species resides, three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado) are receiving areas, while the rest of the states are sending areas. In addition, the magnitude of spatial subsidy can be used as an indicator of the degree to which different locations are telecoupled to other locations. In this example, the Mexican free-tailed bat ecosystem services to cotton production and ecotourism in Texas and New Mexico are heavily dependent on winter habitat in four states in central and southern Mexico. In sum, spatial subsidies can be used to operationalize the telecoupling conceptual framework by identifying sending and receiving areas, and by indicating the degree to which locations are telecoupled to other locations.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025659', 'afid': '60025659', 'affilname': 'Grand Valley State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Allendale', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015574', 'afid': '60015574', 'affilname': 'The University of Tennessee, Knoxville', 'affiliation-city': 'Knoxville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['López-Hoffman L.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'Wiederholt R.', 'Bagstad K.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'McCracken G.', 'Medellin R.', 'Russell A.', 'Semmens D.']","['14063828300', '6602404951', '35932676600', '36819113600', '6602516830', '7201778127', '6604067105', '21433284200', '9234898400']",Ecosystem services | Mexican free-tailed bats | Pest control | Spatial subsidies | Telecoupled natural-human systems | Telecoupling | Transborder conservation,NSF,DEB-1118975,National Science Foundation,,1518359

The ability to assess the relative demographic contributions of these different habitats and pathways to the species’ overall population dynamics is critical for understanding the ecology of migratory species, and also has practical applications for management and conservation. Metrics for assessing habitat contributions have been well-developed for metapopulations, but an equivalent metric is not currently available for migratory populations. Here, we develop a framework for estimating the demographic contributions of the discrete habitats and pathways used by migratory species throughout the annual cycle by estimating the per capita contribution of cohorts using these locations. Our framework accounts for seasonal movements between multiple breeding and non-breeding habitats and for both resident and migratory cohorts. We illustrate our framework using a hypothetical migratory network of four habitats, which allows us to better understand how variations in habitat quality affect per capita contributions. Results indicate that per capita contributions for any habitat or pathway are dependent on habitat-specific survival probabilities in all other areas used as part of the migratory circuit, and that contribution metrics are spatially linked (e.g. reduced survival in one habitat also decreases the contribution metric for other habitats). Our framework expands existing theory on the dynamics of spatiotemporally structured populations by developing a generalized approach to estimate the habitat- and pathway-specific contributions of species migrating between multiple breeding and multiple non-breeding habitats for a range of life histories or migratory strategies. Most importantly, it provides a means of prioritizing conservation efforts towards those migratory pathways and habitats that are most critical for the population viability of migratory species.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112453', 'afid': '60112453', 'affilname': 'Emmanuel College', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024895', 'afid': '60024895', 'affilname': 'Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien', 'affiliation-city': 'Vienna', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015881', 'afid': '60015881', 'affilname': 'University of Guelph', 'affiliation-city': 'Guelph', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013518', 'afid': '60013518', 'affilname': 'Capital University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004404', 'afid': '60004404', 'affilname': 'Patuxent Wildlife Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Laurel', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wiederholt R.', 'Mattsson B.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'Runge M.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'Erickson R.', 'Federico P.', 'López-Hoffman L.', 'Fryxell J.', 'Norris D.', 'Sample C.']","['35932676600', '12241300500', '6602516830', '7101940371', '6602404951', '56148423600', '14007725800', '14063828300', '7004203471', '7201567647', '36337127900']",,USGS,Award # 1518359,U.S. Geological Survey,,1518359

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Variation in movement across time and space fundamentally shapes the abundance and distribution of populations. Although a variety of approaches model structured population dynamics, they are limited to specific types of spatially structured populations and lack a unifying framework. Here, we propose a unified network-based framework sufficiently novel in its flexibility to capture a wide variety of spatiotemporal processes including metapopulations and a range of migratory patterns. It can accommodate different kinds of age structures, forms of population growth, dispersal, nomadism and migration, and alternative life-history strategies. Our objective was to link three general elements common to all spatially structured populations (space, time and movement) under a single mathematical framework. To do this, we adopt a network modeling approach. The spatial structure of a population is represented by a weighted and directed network. Each node and each edge has a set of attributes which vary through time. The dynamics of our network-based population is modeled with discrete time steps. Using both theoretical and real-world examples, we show how common elements recur across species with disparate movement strategies and how they can be combined under a unified mathematical framework. We illustrate how metapopulations, various migratory patterns, and nomadism can be represented with this modeling approach. We also apply our network-based framework to four organisms spanning a wide range of life histories, movement patterns, and carrying capacities. General computer code to implement our framework is provided, which can be applied to almost any spatially structured population. This framework contributes to our theoretical understanding of population dynamics and has practical management applications, including understanding the impact of perturbations on population size, distribution, and movement patterns. By working within a common framework, there is less chance that comparative analyses are colored by model details rather than general principles.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112453', 'afid': '60112453', 'affilname': 'Emmanuel College', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031781', 'afid': '60031781', 'affilname': 'University of Redlands', 'affiliation-city': 'Redlands', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025804', 'afid': '60025804', 'affilname': 'CSIRO Land and Water', 'affiliation-city': 'Highett VIC', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024895', 'afid': '60024895', 'affilname': 'Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien', 'affiliation-city': 'Vienna', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016251', 'afid': '60016251', 'affilname': 'Louisiana Tech University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ruston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015881', 'afid': '60015881', 'affilname': 'University of Guelph', 'affiliation-city': 'Guelph', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013518', 'afid': '60013518', 'affilname': 'Capital University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sample C.', 'Fryxell J.', 'Bieri J.', 'Federico P.', 'Earl J.', 'Wiederholt R.', 'Mattsson B.', 'Flockhart D.', 'Nicol S.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'Erickson R.', 'Norris D.']","['36337127900', '7004203471', '36697670100', '14007725800', '26655509700', '35932676600', '12241300500', '15131335400', '35729355400', '6602404951', '6602516830', '56148423600', '7201567647']",connectivity | dispersal | metapopulations | migration | models | networks,NSF,-1300426,National Science Foundation,,1518359

Abstract: Many metrics exist for quantifying the relative value of habitats and pathways used by highly mobile species. Properly selecting and applying such metrics requires substantial background in mathematics and understanding the relevant management arena. To address this multidimensional challenge, we demonstrate and compare three measurements of habitat quality: graph-, occupancy-, and demographic-based metrics. Each metric provides insights into system dynamics, at the expense of increasing amounts and complexity of data and models. Our descriptions and comparisons of diverse habitat-quality metrics provide means for practitioners to overcome the modeling challenges associated with management or conservation of such highly mobile species. Whereas previous guidance for applying habitat-quality metrics has been scattered in diversified tracks of literature, we have brought this information together into an approachable format including accessible descriptions and a modeling case study for a typical example that conservation professionals can adapt for their own decision contexts and focal populations. Considerations for Resource Managers: Management objectives, proposed actions, data availability and quality, and model assumptions are all relevant considerations when applying and interpreting habitat-quality metrics. Graph-based metrics answer questions related to habitat centrality and connectivity, are suitable for populations with any movement pattern, quantify basic spatial and temporal patterns of occupancy and movement, and require the least data. Occupancy-based metrics answer questions about likelihood of persistence or colonization, are suitable for populations that undergo localized extinctions, quantify spatial and temporal patterns of occupancy and movement, and require a moderate amount of data. Demographic-based metrics answer questions about relative or absolute population size, are suitable for populations with any movement pattern, quantify demographic processes and population dynamics, and require the most data. More real-world examples applying occupancy-based, agent-based, and continuous-based metrics to seasonally migratory species are needed to better understand challenges and opportunities for applying these metrics more broadly.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112453', 'afid': '60112453', 'affilname': 'Emmanuel College', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031781', 'afid': '60031781', 'affilname': 'University of Redlands', 'affiliation-city': 'Redlands', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025804', 'afid': '60025804', 'affilname': 'CSIRO Land and Water', 'affiliation-city': 'Highett VIC', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024895', 'afid': '60024895', 'affilname': 'Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien', 'affiliation-city': 'Vienna', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016251', 'afid': '60016251', 'affilname': 'Louisiana Tech University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ruston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015881', 'afid': '60015881', 'affilname': 'University of Guelph', 'affiliation-city': 'Guelph', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013518', 'afid': '60013518', 'affilname': 'Capital University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Bieri J.', 'Sample C.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'Earl J.', 'Erickson R.', 'Federico P.', 'Flockhart D.', 'Nicol S.', 'Semmens D.', 'Skraber T.', 'Wiederholt R.', 'Mattsson B.']","['36697670100', '36337127900', '6602516830', '6602404951', '26655509700', '56148423600', '14007725800', '15131335400', '35729355400', '9234898400', '57200297585', '35932676600', '12241300500']",demographic model | graph | metapopulation | migration | network | occupancy,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518359

A successful program for monitoring population trend hinges on the ability to detect the trend of interest. Power analyses are useful for quantifying the sample size needed for trend detection, given expected variation in the population. Four components of variation (within-year variation at a given site, interannual variation within a site, variation among sites in the interannual variation, and variation among sites in mean abundance or density) are commonly considered in power analyses for population trend, but a fifth is rarely considered: variation among sites in the local trend. Spatial variation in trend is expected to reduce statistical power, but the magnitude of this reduction has not been fully explored. We used computer simulations to evaluate the consequences of ignoring spatial variation in trend under a variety of sampling designs and wide ranges of other components of variation. The effect of spatial variation in trend on power was minor when other input parameters took extreme values that made the trend either very difficult or very easy to detect. However, at moderate values of the other parameters, spatial variation in trend had a strong effect, reducing statistical power by up to 60%. In some cases, ignoring spatial variation in trend resulted in an 80% probability of a type I error (falsely detecting a trend in a stable population). Spatial variation in trend is therefore an important consideration when designing a long-term monitoring program for many species, especially those affected by local conditions at sites that are repeatedly surveyed. If variation in trend is ignored, as in many previous power analyses, the recommended sampling design will likely be insufficient to detect the trend of interest and lead to potentially false conclusions of a stable population.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Weiser E.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'López-Hoffman L.', 'Semmens D.', 'Thogmartin W.']","['36496011200', '6602404951', '14063828300', '9234898400', '6602516830']",long-term monitoring | population trend | power analysis,USGS,undefined,U.S. Geological Survey,,1518359

Here we illustrate a key step in this process by estimating hunting and birding values of the northern pintail (Anas acuta) within primary breeding and wintering habitats used during the species’ annual migratory cycle in North America. We used published information on user expenditures and net economic values (consumer surplus) for recreational viewing and hunting to determine the economic value of pintail-based recreation in three primary breeding areas and two primary wintering areas. Summed expenditures and consumer surplus for northern pintail viewing were annually valued at $70M, and annual sport hunting totaled $31M (2014 USD). Expenditures for viewing ($42M) were more than twice as high than those for hunting ($18M). Estimates of consumer surplus, defined as the amount consumers are willing to pay above their current expenditures, were $15M greater for viewing ($28M) than for hunting ($13M). We discovered substantial annual consumer surplus ($41M) available for pintail conservation from birders and hunters. We also found spatial differences in economic value among the primary regions used by pintails, with viewing generally valued more in breeding regions than in wintering regions and the reverse being true for hunting. The economic value of pintail-based recreation in the Western wintering region ($26M) exceeded that in any other region by at least a factor of three. Our approach of developing regionally explicit economic values can be extended to other taxonomic groups, and is particularly suitable for migratory game birds because of the availability of large amounts of data. When combined with habitat-linked population models, regionally explicit values could inform development of more effective conservation finance and policy mechanisms to enhance environmental management and societal benefits across the geographically dispersed areas used by migratory species.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107274', 'afid': '60107274', 'affilname': 'Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center', 'affiliation-city': 'La Crosse', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024895', 'afid': '60024895', 'affilname': 'Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien', 'affiliation-city': 'Vienna', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017383', 'afid': '60017383', 'affilname': 'Nature Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114515644', 'afid': '114515644', 'affilname': 'Division of Migratory Bird Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Lakewood', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mattsson B.', 'Dubovsky J.', 'Thogmartin W.', 'Bagstad K.', 'Goldstein J.', 'Loomis J.', 'Diffendorfer J.', 'Semmens D.', 'Wiederholt R.', 'López-Hoffman L.']","['12241300500', '7004267660', '6602516830', '36819113600', '14028269100', '24590584400', '6602404951', '9234898400', '35932676600', '14063828300']",Birding | Migratory species conservation | North America | Northern pintail | Recreation economics | Waterfowl hunting,,1518359,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0301479717311246,1518359

The ability to assess the relative demographic contributions of these different habitats and pathways to the species’ overall population dynamics is critical for understanding the ecology of migratory species, and also has practical applications for management and conservation. Metrics for assessing habitat contributions have been well-developed for metapopulations, but an equivalent metric is not currently available for migratory populations. Here, we develop a framework for estimating the demographic contributions of the discrete habitats and pathways used by migratory species throughout the annual cycle by estimating the per capita contribution of cohorts using these locations. Our framework accounts for seasonal movements between multiple breeding and non-breeding habitats and for both resident and migratory cohorts. We illustrate our framework using a hypothetical migratory network of four habitats, which allows us to better understand how variations in habitat quality affect per capita contributions. Results indicate that per capita contributions for any habitat or pathway are dependent on habitat-specific survival probabilities in all other areas used as part of the migratory circuit, and that contribution metrics are spatially linked (e.g. reduced survival in one habitat also decreases the contribution metric for other habitats). Our framework expands existing theory on the dynamics of spatiotemporally structured populations by developing a generalized approach to estimate the habitat- and pathway-specific contributions of species migrating between multiple breeding and multiple non-breeding habitats for a range of life histories or migratory strategies.

By quantifying the economic value of ecosystem services (ESs) provided across a species’ range and ecological data on a species’ habitat dependence, we estimate spatial subsidies—how different regions support ESs provided by a species across its range. We illustrate this method for migratory northern pintail ducks in North America. Pintails support over $101 million USD annually in recreational hunting and viewing and subsistence hunting in the U.S. and Canada. Pintail breeding regions provide nearly $30 million in subsidies to wintering regions, with the “Prairie Pothole” region supplying over $24 million in annual benefits to other regions. This information can be used to inform conservation funding allocation among migratory regions and nations on which the pintail depends. We thus illustrate a transferrable method to quantify migratory species-derived ESs and provide information to aid in their transboundary conservation.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112453', 'afid': '60112453', 'affilname': 'Emmanuel College', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031781', 'afid': '60031781', 'affilname': 'University of Redlands', 'affiliation-city': 'Redlands', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024895', 'afid': '60024895', 'affilname': 'Universitat fur Bodenkultur Wien', 'affiliation-city': 'Vienna', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017383', 'afid': '60017383', 'affilname': 'Nature Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013140', 'afid': '60013140', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey Central Region', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120505063', 'afid': '120505063', 'affilname': 'Institute of Silviculture (WALDBAU)', 'affiliation-city': 'Vienna', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114515644', 'afid': '114515644', 'affilname': 'Division of Migratory Bird Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Lakewood', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106966547', 'afid': '106966547', 'affilname': 'Everglades Foundation', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bagstad K.J.', 'Semmens D.J.', 'Diffendorfer J.E.', 'Mattsson B.J.', 'Dubovsky J.', 'Thogmartin W.E.', 'Wiederholt R.', 'Loomis J.', 'Bieri J.A.', 'Sample C.', 'Goldstein J.', 'López-Hoffman L.']","['36819113600', '9234898400', '6602404951', '12241300500', '7004267660', '6602516830', '35932676600', '24590584400', '36697670100', '36337127900', '14028269100', '14063828300']",Migration | Northern pintail duck | Spatial subsidies | Species conservation | Telecoupling | Transborder conservation,USGS,undefined,U.S. Geological Survey,,1518359

All rights reserved. Time is a valuable but limited resource, and animals' survival depends on their ability to carefully manage the amount of time they allocate to each daily activity. While existing research has examined the ecological factors affecting animals' activity budgets, the impact of anthropogenic factors on urban-dwelling animals' time budgets remains understudied. Here we collected data through focal animal sampling from three groups of rhesus macaques in Northern India to examine whether interactions with humans decrease macaques' resting and social time (time constraints hypothesis), or whether, by contrast, foraging on anthropogenic food, that is potentially high in calories, leads macaques to spend more time resting and in social interactions (free time hypothesis). We found that macaques who interacted more frequently with people spent significantly less time resting and grooming, supporting the time constraints hypothesis. We argue that these time constraints are likely caused by the unpredictability of human behaviour.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103629', 'afid': '60103629', 'affilname': 'Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram', 'affiliation-city': 'Thiruvananthapuram', 'affiliation-country': 'India'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072478', 'afid': '60072478', 'affilname': 'California National Primate Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014168', 'afid': '60014168', 'affilname': 'Uniwersytet im.

Objectives: The impact of anthropogenic environmental changes may impose strong pressures on the behavioral flexibility of free-ranging animals. Here, we examine whether rates of interactions with humans had both a direct and indirect influence on the duration and distribution of social grooming in commensal rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Materials and Methods: Data were collected in two locations in the city of Shimla in northern India: an urban setting and a temple area. We divided these two locations in a series of similar-sized physical blocks (N = 48) with varying rates of human–macaque interactions. We conducted focal observations on three free-ranging rhesus macaque groups, one in the urban area and two in the temple area. Results: Our analysis shows that macaques engaged in shorter grooming bouts and were more vigilant while grooming in focal sessions during which they interacted with people more frequently, suggesting that humans directly affected grooming effort and vigilance behavior. Furthermore, we found that in blocks characterized by higher rates of human–macaque interactions grooming bouts were shorter, more frequently interrupted by vigilance behavior, and were less frequently reciprocated. Discussion: Our work shows that the rates of human–macaque interaction had both a direct and indirect impact on grooming behavior and that macaques flexibly modified their grooming interactions in relation to the rates of human–macaque interaction to which they were exposed. Because grooming has important social and hygienic functions in nonhuman primates, our work suggests that human presence can have important implications for animal health, social relationships and, ultimately, fitness. Our results point to the need of areas away from people even for highly adaptable species where they can engage in social interactions without human disruption.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072478', 'afid': '60072478', 'affilname': 'California National Primate Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007173', 'afid': '60007173', 'affilname': 'University of Wolverhampton', 'affiliation-city': 'Wolverhampton', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108156950', 'afid': '108156950', 'affilname': 'Himachal Pradesh Forest Department', 'affiliation-city': 'Shimla', 'affiliation-country': 'India'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kaburu S.', 'Marty P.', 'Beisner B.', 'Balasubramaniam K.', 'Bliss-Moreau E.', 'Kaur K.', 'Mohan L.', 'McCowan B.']","['55320301600', '56727750600', '25824679500', '52263178300', '6506839563', '57214547232', '57204465155', '55892677300']",behavioral flexibility | grooming reciprocity | habitat preservation | survival analysis | vigilance,NSF,1518555,National Science Foundation,,1518555

Civil conflict is the most prevalent form of armed conflict in the world today, but this significant driver of food and income security has been largely missing from studies of fisheries. Fisheries conflict is an example of complex dynamics operating in social-ecological systems. We theorize and document the existence of such a feedback loop between conflict in Uganda and fisheries in Lake Victoria. Civil war in northern Uganda resulted in mass human population displacement, which corresponded in time with increases in fishing effort in Lake Victoria. Subsequent changes in catch of Nile perch, the dominant commercial fishery, sparked armed conflict in the lake itself, at Migingo Island, between Uganda and Kenya. From this case study, we draw seven main conclusions. First, these correlation-based relationships are illustrative but not conclusive and we call for further empirical investigation. Second, the couplings between conflict and fishing subsystems are spatially asymmetric: conflict effects are diffuse in their links to broad changes in the fishery, whereas fishery effects may produce more localized conflict events. Third, and most relevant to conflict scholars, the drivers of fishing effort and catch may originate in different subsystems, but their changes and effects must be analyzed in concert. Fourth, the complex and path-dependent impacts of conflicts on natural resources in general, and fisheries in particular, highlights the urgent need for targeted surveys and more mechanistic understanding. Fifth, the open access nature of fisheries in Lake Victoria may exacerbate instabilities not present in other systems. Sixth, the diffuse and context-specific effects of conflicts on fisheries means models of fisheries management (e.g., stock assessment) should not incorporate conflict as a driver at this time. Finally, countries and their stakeholders should focus on diversification in employment for short term coping mechanisms during conflict as a means of short-circuiting the conflict-fisheries feedback loop.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030089', 'afid': '60030089', 'affilname': 'Conservation International', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026668', 'afid': '60026668', 'affilname': 'Peterson Institute for International Economics', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015404', 'afid': '60015404', 'affilname': 'University of Denver', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122548369', 'afid': '122548369', 'affilname': 'GIZ', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': None}]",Journal,Article,"['Glaser S.', 'Hendrix C.', 'Franck B.', 'Wedig K.', 'Kaufman L.']","['35966044500', '21233416200', '57189759664', '56861302600', '7201751143']",Fisheries conflict | Food security | Internally displaced persons | Lake Victoria | Social-ecological systems,DOD,1358861,U.S. Department of Defense,,1518532

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has undergone significant urban expansion in a closed basin that once supported a large lacustrine system. While urbanization has been mentioned as a factor in observed meteorological trends, a systematic study of the effects of land use-land cover change (LULCC) on seasonal meteorology is lacking. In this study, we utilize theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) systemto determine the spatiotemporal changes in near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and boundary layer conditions induced by the modern-day urban landscape relative to presettlement conditions. We capture the MCMA extent through an improved Landsat-based multicategory urban classification and therefore account for intraurban spatial heterogeneity and further conduct additional experiments to examine the sensitivity to anthropogenic heating within WRF. We find that accounting for these factors produced the best simulations of thermal conditions, with RMSE values less than 1.5°C at all measurement stations, and an improved diurnal cycle of air temperature and precipitation.We then assessed the impacts of LULCC in the MCMA, finding that thermal changes were largest during daytime hours, with temperature increasing, on average, by more than 4°C. Furthermore, we utilize these simulations to mechanistically link the built environment-induced increase in air temperature to simulated increases in rainfall during the evening hours. To our knowledge, this study provides the first dynamical and thermodynamical evidence to support the rainfall enhancements documented through observations in the MCMA and link it quantitatively to the warming effects associated with urbanization. These results have important implications for understanding the meteorological conditions leading to widespread urban flooding in the MCMA.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161', 'afid': '60027161', 'affilname': 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev', 'affiliation-city': 'Beer Sheba', 'affiliation-country': 'Israel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009043', 'afid': '60009043', 'affilname': 'School of Earth and Space Exploration', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Benson-Lira V.', 'Georgescu M.', 'Kaplan S.', 'Vivoni E.']","['56728897300', '7103081749', '55440326200', '6603256951']",,NSF,EAR-1204774,National Science Foundation,,1414052

Both economic theory and social-ecological systems analysis point to the importance of cross-scalar investments and institutional support in breaking down persistent poverty traps. Using data from twelve focus groups conducted in Mexico City, we illustrate how such cross-scale connectivity is failing as a result of lack of trust and transparency, the difficulty of collective action, and the devolution of some responsibilities for risk management from the public sector to the household level.

Social-ecological organization is a multidimensional phenomenon that combines material and symbolic processes. However, the coupling between social and ecological subsystem is often conceptualized as purely material, thus reducing the symbolic dimension to its behavioral and actionable expressions. In this paper I conceptualize social-ecological systems as doubly coupled. On the one hand, material expressions of socio-cultural processes affect and are affected by ecological dynamics. On the other hand, coupled social-ecological material dynamics are concurrently coupled with subjective dynamics via coding, decoding, personal experience, and human agency. This second coupling operates across two organizationally heterogeneous dimensions: material and symbolic. Although resilience thinking builds on the recognition of organizational asymmetry between living and nonliving systems, it has overlooked the equivalent asymmetry between ecological and socio-cultural subsystems. Three guiding concepts are proposed to formalize double coupling. The first one, social-ecological asymmetry, expands on past seminal work on ecological self-organization to incorporate reflexivity and subjectivity in social-ecological modeling. Organizational asymmetry is based in the distinction between social rules, which are symbolically produced and changed through human agents’ reflexivity and purpose, and biophysical rules, which are determined by functional relations between ecological components. The second guiding concept, conscious power, brings to the fore human agents’ distinctive capacity to produce our own subjective identity and the consequences of this capacity for social-ecological organization.

Here we discuss the burden for households of coping with, and adapting to, adverse water conditions in economically marginal areas of Mexico City. We argue that households’ efforts to adapt in conditions of marginality can come at the expense of households’ investment in other aspects of human welfare, reinforcing poverty traps. Both economic theory and social-ecological systems analysis point to the importance of cross-scalar investments and institutional support in breaking down persistent poverty traps. Using data from twelve focus groups conducted in Mexico City, we illustrate how such cross-scale connectivity is failing as a result of lack of trust and transparency, the difficulty of collective action, and the devolution of some responsibilities for risk management from the public sector to the household level. We conclude our analysis by arguing for greater attention to these tradeoffs in public policy to help ensure that adaptation does not come at the cost of more generic welfare gains among the most vulnerable populations.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Eakin H.', 'Lerner A.', 'Manuel-Navarrete D.', 'Hernández Aguilar B.', 'Martínez-Canedo A.', 'Tellman B.', 'Charli-Joseph L.', 'Fernández Álvarez R.', 'Bojórquez-Tapia L.']","['9132756500', '35322166900', '8711445900', '57191528518', '57191976188', '55305522500', '57190163683', '57191970711', '6603954072']",Adaptive capacity | Flooding | Poverty traps | Water scarcity,NSF,1414052,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1462901116302921,1414052

Social-ecological organization is a multidimensional phenomenon that combines material and symbolic processes. However, the coupling between social and ecological subsystem is often conceptualized as purely material, thus reducing the symbolic dimension to its behavioral and actionable expressions. In this paper I conceptualize social-ecological systems as doubly coupled. On the one hand, material expressions of socio-cultural processes affect and are affected by ecological dynamics. On the other hand, coupled social-ecological material dynamics are concurrently coupled with subjective dynamics via coding, decoding, personal experience, and human agency. This second coupling operates across two organizationally heterogeneous dimensions: material and symbolic. Although resilience thinking builds on the recognition of organizational asymmetry between living and nonliving systems, it has overlooked the equivalent asymmetry between ecological and socio-cultural subsystems. Three guiding concepts are proposed to formalize double coupling. The first one, social-ecological asymmetry, expands on past seminal work on ecological self-organization to incorporate reflexivity and subjectivity in social-ecological modeling. Organizational asymmetry is based in the distinction between social rules, which are symbolically produced and changed through human agents’ reflexivity and purpose, and biophysical rules, which are determined by functional relations between ecological components. The second guiding concept, conscious power, brings to the fore human agents’ distinctive capacity to produce our own subjective identity and the consequences of this capacity for social-ecological organization. The third concept, congruence between subjective and objective dynamics, redefines sustainability as contingent on congruent relations between material and symbolic processes. Social-ecological theories and analyses based on these three guiding concepts would support the integration of current structuralist-functionalist methods, which sufficiently and appropriately characterize ecological organization, with ethnographic and narrative methods exploring human intentionality, reflexivity, and biographical development.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,['Manuel-Navarrete D.'],['8711445900'],Congruence | Conscious power | Coupled nature-human systems | Social-ecological organization | Subjectivity | Sustainability,,undefined,,,1414052

The rapid environmental changes currently underway in many dry regions of the world, and the deep uncertainty about their consequences, underscore a critical challenge for sustainability: how to maintain cooperation that ensures the provision of natural resources when the benefits of cooperating are variable, sometimes uncertain, and often limited. In this work, we present the case of a group of rural communities in a semi-desert region of Chile, where cooperation in the form of labor-sharing has helped maintain higher agriculture yields, group cohesion, and identity. Today, these communities face the challenge of adapting to recurrent droughts, extreme rainfall, and desertification. We formulated an agent-based model to investigate the consequences of regional climate changes on the fate of these labor-exchange institutions. The model, implemented in the framework of prospect theory, simulates the economic decisions of households to engage, or not, in labor-sharing agreements under different scenarios of water supply, water variability, and socio-environmental risk. Results show that the number of fulfilled labor-sharing agreements is reduced by water scarcity and environmental variability. More importantly, defections that involve non-fulfillment of these agreements are more likely to emerge at the intermediate level of environmental variability and water supply stress.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has undergone significant urban expansion in a closed basin that once supported a large lacustrine system. While urbanization has been mentioned as a factor in observed meteorological trends, a systematic study of the effects of land use-land cover change (LULCC) on seasonal meteorology is lacking. In this study, we utilize theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) systemto determine the spatiotemporal changes in near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and boundary layer conditions induced by the modern-day urban landscape relative to presettlement conditions. We capture the MCMA extent through an improved Landsat-based multicategory urban classification and therefore account for intraurban spatial heterogeneity and further conduct additional experiments to examine the sensitivity to anthropogenic heating within WRF. We find that accounting for these factors produced the best simulations of thermal conditions, with RMSE values less than 1.5°C at all measurement stations, and an improved diurnal cycle of air temperature and precipitation.We then assessed the impacts of LULCC in the MCMA, finding that thermal changes were largest during daytime hours, with temperature increasing, on average, by more than 4°C. Furthermore, we utilize these simulations to mechanistically link the built environment-induced increase in air temperature to simulated increases in rainfall during the evening hours. To our knowledge, this study provides the first dynamical and thermodynamical evidence to support the rainfall enhancements documented through observations in the MCMA and link it quantitatively to the warming effects associated with urbanization. These results have important implications for understanding the meteorological conditions leading to widespread urban flooding in the MCMA.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161', 'afid': '60027161', 'affilname': 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev', 'affiliation-city': 'Beer Sheba', 'affiliation-country': 'Israel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009043', 'afid': '60009043', 'affilname': 'School of Earth and Space Exploration', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Benson-Lira V.', 'Georgescu M.', 'Kaplan S.', 'Vivoni E.']","['56728897300', '7103081749', '55440326200', '6603256951']",,NSF,EAR-1204774,National Science Foundation,,1414052

In order to develop pathways for improved sustainability, the disparate factors that create vulnerable conditions and outcomes must be visible to decision-makers. Nevertheless, for such decision-makers to manage vulnerability effectively, they need to define the salient boundaries of the urban SES, and the relevant biophysical, technological, and socio-institutional attributes that play critical roles in vulnerability dynamics. Here we explore the problem of hydrological risk in Mexico City, where vulnerabilities to flooding and water scarcity are interconnected temporally and spatially, yet the formal and informal institutions and actors involved in the production and management of vulnerability are divided into two discrete problem domains: land-use planning and water resource management. We analyze interviews with city officials working in both domains to understand their different perspectives on the dynamics of socio-hydrological risk, including flooding and water scarcity. We find governance gaps within land-use planning and water management that lead to hydro-social risk, stemming from a failure to address informal institutions that exacerbate vulnerability to flooding and water scarcity. Mandates in both sectors are overlapping and confusing, while socio-hydrological risk is externalized to the informal domain, making it ungoverned.

Human Niche Construction theory, however, predicts evolutionary pressures acting over social groups that, this paper contends, tend to favor gray over green infrastructure. This conflict is due to competitive advantages of gray infrastructure, such as their higher capacity to concentrate and intensively use natural resources. Cities need to intentionally override these evolutionary pressures to allow emergence of regimes where green solutions are the normal way of responding to infrastructure-related challenges and development. The override calls for understanding how infrastructure regime dynamics are historically constructed, and cultivating collective intentions capable of harnessing such dynamics. After conceptualizing the roles of evolution versus collective intentionality in infrastructure regime dynamics, we apply Foucauldian genealogical analysis to critically understand how and why the superiority of gray infrastructure became naturalized as truth in Mexico City, Mexico. The analysis explores how gray infrastructure momentum was built over history and the sporadic emergence of collective intentions to break it. Findings show that shifting to a green- infrastructure-dominated regime in Mexico City today would benefit from strategies that simultaneously promote technical, political and subjective changes. Purely technical efforts to promote regime shifts are doomed to fail. Decentralization, democratization, and cultivating certain collective intentions are key factors to override evolutionary pressures.

A participatory modeling project, MEGADAPT, examines hydrological risk as co-constructed by both biophysical and social factors and aims to explore alternative scenarios of governance. Within the model, neighborhoods are represented as agents that take actions to reduce their sensitivity to exposure and risk. These risk management actions (to protect their households against flooding and scarcity) are based upon insights derived from focus group discussions within various neighborhoods. We developed a role-playing game based on the model's rules in order to validate the assumptions we made about residents’ decision-making given that we had translated qualitative information from focus group sessions into a quantitative model algorithm. This enables us to qualitatively validate the perspective and experience of residents in an agent-based model mid-way through the modeling process. Within the context of described hydrological events and the causes of these events, residents took on the role of themselves in the game and were asked to make decisions about how to protect their households against scarcity and flooding.

These responses are, in part, modulated by political relationships under cultural norms that dominate the institutional and collective decisions of public and private actors. The legacy of these decisions, which are often associated with investment in hard and soft infrastructure, has lasting consequences that influence current and future vulnerabilities. Making those decisions visible, and tractable is, therefore, an urgent research and political challenge in vulnerability assessments. In this work, we present a modeling framework to explore scenarios of institutional decision-making and socio-political processes and the resultant effects on spatial patterns of vulnerability. The approach entails using multi-criteria decision analysis, agent-based models, and geographic information simulation. The approach allows for the exploration of uncertainties, spatial patterns, thresholds, and the sensitivities of vulnerability outcomes to different policy scenarios. Here, we present the operationalization of the framework through an intentionally simplified model example of the governance of water in Mexico City.

This study evaluates the May and October 2015 flood prediction skill of a physically based model resembling the U.S. National Water Model (NWM) over the Texas Hill Country. It also investigates hydrometeorological factors that contributed to a record flood along the Blanco River at Wimberley (WMBT2) in May 2015. Using two radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) products-Stage IV and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS)-it is shown that the event precipitation accuracy dominates the prediction skill, where the finer-resolution MRMS QPE mainly benefits basins with small drainage areas. Overall, the model exhibits good performance at gauges with fast flood response from causative rainfall and gauges that are not forecast points in the National Weather Service's Advanced Hydrometeorological Prediction System, showing great promise for forecasts, warnings, and emergency response. However, the model suffers from poor prediction skill over regions without rapid flood response and regions with human-altered flows, suggesting the need to revisit the channel routing algorithm and incorporate modules to represent human alterations. Two contrasting flood events at WMBT2 with similar meteorological characteristics are examined in greater detail, revealing that the location of intense rainfall combined with land physiographic features are key to the flood response differences. Model sensitivity tests further show the record flood peak could be better obtained by tuning the deep-layer soil wetness and the flow velocity field in the river network, which offers hydrometeorological insights into the causes and the complex nature of such a flood and why the model struggles to predict the record flood peak.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023539', 'afid': '60023539', 'affilname': 'Jackson School of Geosciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016211', 'afid': '60016211', 'affilname': 'Institute of Atmospheric Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113784909', 'afid': '113784909', 'affilname': 'NOAA/NWS Austin/San Antonio Weather Forecast Office', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lin P.', 'Hopper L.J.', 'Yang Z.L.', 'Lenz M.', 'Zeitler J.W.']","['56900345700', '35362032500', '7405429767', '57203824105', '6603217981']",Atmosphere | Flood events | Hydrologic models | Hydrometeorology,,undefined,,,1518541

We suggest that speleothems that grow in well-ventilated zones of caves may preserve such high-resolution records. Near-entrance cave environments are characterized by year-round, near-atmospheric CO2 concentrations and are significantly influenced by surface air temperature fluctuations, particularly in temperate latitudes. Previous monitoring studies of a well-ventilated, temperate-latitude cave (Westcave Preserve, central Texas) have documented seasonal variations in the oxygen isotope composition of calcite grown on glass substrates (with winter δ18O maxima and summer δ18O minima) as well as seasonal variations in drip water trace element compositions. Extending this work to a stalagmite (WC-3) from the same drip site, we find that stalagmite δ18O variations are similar in magnitude to the seasonal δ18O variations previously observed for calcite grown on glass substrates, that stalagmite [Mg] variations have a similar seasonal period with winter minima and summer maxima, and that geochemical variations follow stalagmite growth fabric as mm-scale couplets comprising thin, slow-growing, compact sparry calcite laminae (winters) and thicker, fast-growing, porous-elongate columnar calcite laminae (summers). We interpret a high-resolution (weekly to monthly) 52-year record of δ18O, Mg, Sr, and Ba in WC-3, and report new monthly measurements of drip water and associated calcite grown on glass substrates. We find drip water δ18O and [Mg]/[Ca] are essentially invariant and that seasonal variations in WC-3 calcite δ18O and Mg concentration agree well with predicted temperature-dependent fractionation between water and calcite. WC-3 calcite Sr and Ba also vary, but with higher and more variable frequencies compared to δ18O and [Mg]. The annual nature of δ18O and [Mg] cycles is supported by monitoring and 14C bomb-peak chronology. We suggest that stalagmite δ18O and [Mg] vary primarily in response to large seasonal temperature changes in this setting, allowing for unambiguous differentiation between summer and winter calcite growth. From such δ18O- and [Mg]- derived sub-annual chronologies, the timing of enrichments in other geochemical species that are less directly coupled to external cave temperature (e.g., calcite Sr and Ba) can be considered as proxies of other important processes such as water-rock interaction in the epikarst, precipitation events, or subsurface respiration rates. The potential for this kind of multi-proxy, seasonally-resolved dating may add near-entrance stalagmites to the list (ice cores, lake varves, tree rings) of high-resolution terrestrial proxies available for paleoclimate studies.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Carlson P.', 'Miller N.', 'Banner J.', 'Breecker D.', 'Casteel R.']","['57195527769', '56535841300', '7004220101', '22936682300', '55986240900']",Near-entrance speleothem | Oxygen isotopes | Sub-annual chronology | Trace elements,NSF,EAR-1124514,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S001670371830259X,1518541

Global environmental challenges are increasingly complex and interdependent and the sentiment that sustainability requires new approaches to integrating science and policy is ubiquitous. This is the domain of sustainability science. Yet, major gaps exist in our understanding of the relationships between researchers from different disciplines and between science, policy, and management. While scientific research is shifting toward greater collaboration and transdisciplinarity, we need to improve our understanding of the processes and structures that lead to successful scientific collaboration and high-impact, innovative science-policy outcomes. ‘Networks and networking’ offer a powerful strategy for integration in sustainability science, yet empirical research assessing network-based integration is limited. Using social network analysis, we empirically investigate the integration of the Texas Water Research Network (TWRN), which comprises academic and non-academic participants from multiple universities, disciplines and research orientations seeking to address the challenges posed by complex, multilevel water resource issues across the state of Texas. We found that TWRN members were relatively well connected (an average of 3.8 ties per member), but that some research groups (e.g. water science) were way more active and connected than others (e.g. scenario building).

Generally, the estimation and prediction of groundwater levels (GWLs) are an important challenge in the field of water resources management. In this study, for the first time, the groundwater level (GWL) of the Sarab Qanbar well located in the south of Kermanshah, Iran, is approximated using the wavelet–SAELM model. An artificial intelligence method called “self-adaptive extreme learning machine (SAELM)” and the “wavelet transform” method were implemented to develop a predictive model. First, using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), the effective lags in estimating the GWL were detected and evaluated. Then, eight distinctive SAELM and WA–SAELM models were developed using the input combinations selected by the ACF and the PACF as different lags. Later, the values of the observational well were normalized to estimate the GWL. Time series data were divided into two subsamples including 70% to train the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and 30% to test the AI models. Next, the most optimized mother wavelet was chosen for the modeling. By evaluating the results of the SAELM and WA–SAELM models, it was concluded that compared to the SAELM models, the WA–SAELM models estimate values of the objective function with higher accuracy. Then, the superior model was introduced, which was very accurate in forecasting the GWL. In the test mode, for example, the correlation coefficient, mean absolute error and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for the superior model were calculated as 0.995, 0.988 and 0.990, respectively. Furthermore, an uncertainty analysis was conducted for the predictive models, revealing that the superior model has an underestimate performance.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109946', 'afid': '60109946', 'affilname': 'Islamic Azad University, Kermanshah Branch', 'affiliation-city': 'Kermanshah', 'affiliation-country': 'Iran'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yosefvand F.', 'Shabanlou S.']","['54797037600', '36162499100']",Groundwater level | Self-adaptive extreme learning machine (SAELM) | Uncertainty analysis | Wavelet transform,,undefined,,,1518541

Global monitoring of soil moisture and snow is now available through various satellite observations from optical, microwave, and gravitational sensors. However, very few modeling frameworks exist that conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for 2003–2009 to investigate individual contributions from different satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth estimation in most high-latitude regions. Generally, the combination of MODIS, GRACE, and AMSR-E observations with regard to spatial locations holds promise to provide a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation through the multi-sensor land data assimilation system.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122052', 'afid': '60122052', 'affilname': 'Southwest University', 'affiliation-city': 'Chongqing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023539', 'afid': '60023539', 'affilname': 'Jackson School of Geosciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016211', 'afid': '60016211', 'affilname': 'Institute of Atmospheric Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhao L.', 'Yang Z.L.']","['55493586600', '7405429767']",AMSR-E | GRACE | Land data assimilation | MODIS | Snow | Soil moisture,NSFC,91337217,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0034425718303110,1518541

In the Australian subtropics, flying-foxes (family Pteropididae) play a fundamental ecological role as forest pollinators. Flying-foxes are also reservoirs of the fatal zoonosis, Hendra virus. Understanding flying fox foraging ecology, particularly in agricultural areas during winter, is critical to determine their role in transmitting Hendra virus to horses and humans. We developed a spatiotemporal model of flying-fox foraging intensity based on foraging patterns of 37 grey-headed flying-foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) using GPS tracking devices and boosted regression trees. We validated the model with independent population counts and summarized temporal patterns in terms of spatial resource concentration. We found that spatial resource concentration was highest in late-summer and lowest in winter, with lowest values in winter 2011, the same year an unprecedented cluster of spillover events occurred in Queensland and New South Wales. Spatial resource concentration was positively correlated with El Niño Southern Oscillation at 3-8 month time lags. Based on shared foraging traits with the primary reservoir of Hendra virus (Pteropus alecto), we used our results to develop hypotheses on how regional climatic history, eucalypt phenology, and foraging behaviour may contribute to the predominance of winter spillovers, and how these phenomena connote foraging habitat conservation as a public health intervention.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028333', 'afid': '60028333', 'affilname': 'University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Sydney', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025804', 'afid': '60025804', 'affilname': 'CSIRO Land and Water', 'affiliation-city': 'Highett VIC', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006183', 'afid': '60006183', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116607508', 'afid': '116607508', 'affilname': 'CSIRO Health and Biosecurity', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Giles J.', 'Eby P.', 'Parry H.', 'Peel A.', 'Plowright R.', 'Westcott D.', 'McCallum H.']","['57213902819', '6603457180', '15066072600', '35559421700', '15078101700', '7004026136', '7005980838']",,NSF,DEB-1716698,Agrifutures Australia,,1716698

Pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans or domestic animals requires a series of conditions to align with space and time. Comparing these conditions between times and locations where spillover does and does not occur presents opportunities to understand the factors that shape spillover risk. Bovine rabies transmitted by vampire bats was first confirmed in 1911 and has since been detected across the distribution of vampire bats. However, Uruguay is an exception. Uruguay was free of bovine rabies until 2007, despite high-cattle densities, the presence of vampire bats and a strong surveillance system. To explore why Uruguay was free of bovine rabies until recently, we review the historic literature and reconstruct the conditions that would allow rabies invasion into Uruguay. We used available historical records on the abundance of livestock and wildlife, the vampire bat distribution and occurrence of rabies outbreaks, as well as environmental modifications, to propose four alternative hypotheses to explain rabies virus emergence and spillover: bat movement, viral invasion, surveillance failure and environmental changes.

Although pathogen emergence has been linked to anthropogenic land conversion, a general framework to disentangle underlying processes is lacking. We develop a multi-host model for pathogen transmission between species inhabiting intact and converted habitat. Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion. This framework provides insights into the mechanisms driving disease emergence and spillover during land conversion.

Understanding infection dynamics in animal hosts is fundamental to managing spillover and emergence of zoonotic infections. Hendra virus is endemic in Australian pteropodid bat populations and can be lethal to horses and humans. However, we know little about the factors driving Hendra virus prevalence in resevoir bat populations, making spillover difficult to predict. We use Hendra virus prevalence data collected from 13 000 pooled bat urine samples across space and time to determine if pulses of prevalence are periodic and synchronized across sites. We also test whether site-specific precipitation and temperature affect the amplitude of the largest annual prevalence pulses. We found little evidence for a periodic signal in Hendra virus prevalence. Although the largest amplitude pulses tended to occur over winter, pulses could also occur in other seasons. We found that Hendra virus prevalence was weakly synchronized across sites over short distances, suggesting that prevalence is driven by local-scale effects. Finally, we found that drier conditions in previous seasons and the abundance of Pteropus alecto were positively correlated with the peak annual values of Hendra virus prevalence. Our results suggest that in addition to seasonal effects, bat density and local climatic conditions interact to drive Hendra virus infection dynamics.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60091700', 'afid': '60091700', 'affilname': 'EcoHealth Alliance', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003763', 'afid': '60003763', 'affilname': 'NSW Department of Primary Industries', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Páez D.J.', 'Giles J.', 'McCallum H.', 'Field H.', 'Jordan D.', 'Peel A.J.', 'Plowright R.K.']","['14623068500', '57213902819', '7005980838', '7102982727', '57216176324', '35559421700', '15078101700']",Animal pathogens | Ebola virus | Emerging infections | Epidemiology | Infectious disease epidemiology,,undefined,,,1716698

Understanding environmental factors driving spatiotemporal patterns of disease can improve risk mitigation strategies. Hendra virus (HeV), discovered in Australia in 1994, spills over from bats (Pteropus sp.) to horses and thence to humans. Below latitude − 22°, almost all spillover events to horses occur during winter, and above this latitude spillover is aseasonal. We generated a statistical model of environmental drivers of HeV spillover per month. The model reproduced the spatiotemporal pattern of spillover risk between 1994 and 2015. The model was generated with an ensemble of methods for presence–absence data (boosted regression trees, random forests and logistic regression). Presences were the locations of horse cases, and absences per spatial unit (2.7 × 2.7 km pixels without spillover) were sampled with the horse census of Queensland and New South Wales. The most influential factors indicate that spillover is associated with both cold-dry and wet conditions. Bimodal responses to several variables suggest spillover involves two systems: one above and one below a latitudinal area close to − 22°. Northern spillovers are associated with cold-dry and wet conditions, and southern with cold-dry conditions. Biologically, these patterns could be driven by immune or behavioural changes in response to food shortage in bats and horse husbandry. Future research should look for differences in these traits between seasons in the two latitudinal regions. Based on the predicted risk patterns by latitude, we recommend enhanced preventive management for horses from March to November below latitude 22° south.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014975', 'afid': '60014975', 'affilname': 'Australian Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Martin G.', 'Yanez-Arenas C.', 'Plowright R.', 'Chen C.', 'Roberts B.', 'Skerratt L.']","['56416910500', '36020727700', '15078101700', '34972708700', '7402979163', '6701841892']",Emerging diseases | Flying foxes | Hendra virus | Horses | Spatiotemporal risk | Spillover,,undefined,State Library of New South Wales,,1716698

Environmental persistence of zoonotic pathogens is a key trait that influences the probability of zoonotic spillover. Pathogen survival outside of the host determines the window available for contact with the new recipient host species and the dose of pathogen available to that host. The longer a pathogen survives in the environment, the more disconnected the reservoir and recipient hosts can be in space and time, and the more likely that an infective dose will be available to recipient hosts. Therefore, environmental persistence is a key parameter for mechanistic models needed to predict pathogen spillover. Avian influenza can be transmitted from wildlife to poultry and people in part due to its ability to persist in the environment. Considerable work has been done to quantify trends in avian influenza persistence across environmental conditions, often published in separate studies with separate datasets. In this paper, we quantify the trends and variability of avian influenza viral persistence across environmental conditions by collating disjoint experimental data on viral particle persistence in water across many studies and a range of environmental conditions. The collated data represent 120 estimates from three different studies of the decay rates of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (90 estimates from Asia and 30 from Europe) in response to temperature, pH, and salinity. We analyzed these data with a Bayesian model to control for biases with random effects and used experimental replicates and R2 estimates of the publication's regression procedures as statistical weights. We found temperature significantly decreases persistence of H5N1 virus in water, and this effect is stronger than that of salinity alone. Salinity interacts with temperature and probably drives the most contrasting persistence scenarios between cold-saline and warm-saline water bodies, where highest and lowest persistence times could occur respectively. Our work provides needed parameters for models that examine the risk of spillover of avian influenza viruses.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022871', 'afid': '60022871', 'affilname': ""St Mary's Hospital London"", 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Martin G.', 'Becker D.', 'Plowright R.']","['56416910500', '56326134900', '15078101700']",Environmental persistence | H5N1 | Influenza | Meta-analysis | Salinity | Temperature | Zoonotic pathogens,NIGMS,DEB-1716698,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,,1716698

Predicting and simplifying which pathogens may spill over from animals to humans is a major priority in infectious disease biology. Many efforts to determine which viruses are at risk of spillover use a subset of viral traits to find trait-based associations with spillover. We adapt a new method—phylofactorization—to identify not traits but lineages of viruses at risk of spilling over. Phylofactorization is used to partition the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses viral taxonomy based on non-human host range of viruses and whether there exists evidence the viruses have infected humans. We identify clades on a range of taxonomic levels with high or low propensities to spillover, thereby simplifying the classification ofzoonotic potential of mammalian viruses. Phylofactorization by whether a virus is zoonotic yields many disjoint clades of viruses containing few to no representatives that have spilled over to humans. Phylofactorization by non-human host breadth yields several clades with significantly higher host breadth. We connect the phylogenetic factors above with life-histories of clades, revisit trait-based analyses, and illustrate how cladistic coarse-graining of zoonotic potential can refine trait-based analyses by illuminating clade-specific determinants of spillover risk.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60091700', 'afid': '60091700', 'affilname': 'EcoHealth Alliance', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100568079', 'afid': '100568079', 'affilname': 'Natl.

All rights reserved. Disease emergence events, epidemics and pandemics all underscore the need to predict zoonotic pathogen spillover. Because cross-species transmission is inherently hierarchical, involving processes that occur at varying levels of biological organization, such predictive efforts can be complicated by the many scales and vastness of data potentially required for forecasting. A wide range of approaches are currently used to forecast spillover risk (e.g. macroecology, pathogen discovery, surveillance of human populations, among others), each of which is bound within particular phylogenetic, spatial and temporal scales of prediction. Here, we contextualize these diverse approaches within their forecasting goals and resulting scales of prediction to illustrate critical areas of conceptual and pragmatic overlap. Specifically, we focus on an ecological perspective to envision a research pipeline that connects these different scales of data and predictions from the aims of discovery to intervention. Pathogen discovery and predictions focused at the phylogenetic scale can first provide coarse and pattern-based guidance for which reservoirs, vectors and pathogens are likely to be involved in spillover, thereby narrowing surveillance targets and where such efforts should be conducted. Next, these predictions can be followed with ecologically driven spatio-temporal studies of reservoirs and vectors to quantify spatio-temporal fluctuations in infection and to mechanistically understand how pathogens circulate and are transmitted to humans. This approach can also help identify general regions and periods for which spillover is most likely. We illustrate this point by highlighting several case studies where long-term, ecologically focused studies (e.g. Lyme disease in the northeast USA, Hendra virus in eastern Australia, Plasmodium knowlesi in Southeast Asia) have facilitated predicting spillover in space and time and facilitated the design of possible intervention strategies. Such studies can in turn help narrow human surveillance efforts and help refine and improve future large-scale, phylogenetic predictions. We conclude by discussing how greater integration and exchange between data and predictions generated across these varying scales could ultimately help generate more actionable forecasts and interventions.

Within host-parasite communities, viral co-circulation and co-infections of hosts are the norm, yet studies of significant emerging zoonoses tend to focus on a single parasite species within the host. Using a multiplexed paramyxovirus bead-based PCR on urine samples from Australian flying foxes, we show that multi-viral shedding from flying fox populations is common. We detected up to nine bat paramyxoviruses shed synchronously. Multi-viral shedding infrequently coalesced into an extreme, brief and spatially restricted shedding pulse, coinciding with peak spillover of Hendra virus, an emerging fatal zoonotic pathogen of high interest. Such extreme pulses of multi-viral shedding could easily be missed during routine surveillance yet have potentially serious consequences for spillover of novel pathogens to humans and domestic animal hosts. We also detected co-occurrence patterns suggestive of the presence of interactions among viruses, such as facilitation and cross-immunity. We propose that multiple viruses may be interacting, influencing the shedding and spillover of zoonotic pathogens. Understanding these interactions in the context of broader scale drivers, such as habitat loss, may help predict shedding pulses of Hendra virus and other fatal zoonoses.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60091700', 'afid': '60091700', 'affilname': 'EcoHealth Alliance', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022071', 'afid': '60022071', 'affilname': 'CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Geelong', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017161', 'afid': '60017161', 'affilname': 'National University of Singapore', 'affiliation-city': 'Singapore City', 'affiliation-country': 'Singapore'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006183', 'afid': '60006183', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004572', 'afid': '60004572', 'affilname': 'Swansea University', 'affiliation-city': 'Swansea', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122381359', 'afid': '122381359', 'affilname': 'Animal Health Policy Branch', 'affiliation-city': 'Canberra', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Peel A.', 'Wells K.', 'Giles J.', 'Boyd V.', 'Burroughs A.', 'Edson D.', 'Crameri G.', 'Baker M.', 'Field H.', 'Wang L.', 'McCallum H.', 'Plowright R.', 'Clark N.']","['35559421700', '57022276900', '57213902819', '8863044500', '56735656300', '56235729500', '6507575662', '56753420600', '7102982727', '35243718700', '7005980838', '15078101700', '56048761800']",co-occurrence analyses | disease ecology | emerging infectious diseases | Markov Random Fields | multi-viral | Pteropus | viral communities | zoonoses,NIAID,1015891,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,,1716698

We produced two models to estimate areas at potential risk of HeV spillover explained by the climatic suitability for its flying fox reservoir hosts, Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus. We included additional climatic variables that might affect spillover risk through other biological processes (such as bat or horse behaviour, plant phenology and bat foraging habitat). Models were fit with a Poisson point process model and a log-Gaussian Cox process. In response to climate change, risk expanded southwards due to an expansion of P. alecto suitable habitat, which increased the number of horses at risk by 175–260% (110,000–165,000). In the northern limits of the current distribution, spillover risk was highly uncertain because of model extrapolation to novel climatic conditions. The extent of areas at risk of spillover from P. conspicillatus was predicted shrink. Due to a likely expansion of P. alecto into these areas, it could replace P. conspicillatus as the main HeV reservoir. We recommend: (1) HeV monitoring in bats, (2) enhancing HeV prevention in horses in areas predicted to be at risk, (3) investigate and develop mitigation strategies for areas that could experience reservoir host replacements.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150', 'afid': '60015150', 'affilname': 'Imperial College London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014975', 'afid': '60014975', 'affilname': 'Australian Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120428218', 'afid': '120428218', 'affilname': 'Guadalupe Victoria', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Martin G.', 'Yanez-Arenas C.', 'Chen C.', 'Plowright R.', 'Webb R.', 'Skerratt L.']","['56416910500', '36020727700', '34972708700', '15078101700', '16235259200', '6701841892']",climate change | flying foxes | Hendra virus | horses | risk | spillover,RIRDC,undefined,Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation,,1716698

All rights reserved. Predicting pathogen spillover requires counting spillover events and aligning such counts with process-related covariates for each spillover event. How can we connect our analysis of spillover counts to simple, mechanistic models of pathogens jumping from reservoir hosts to recipient hosts? We illustrate how the pathways to pathogen spillover can be represented as a directed graph connecting reservoir hosts and recipient hosts and the number of spillover events modelled as a percolation of infectious units along that graph. Percolation models of pathogen spillover formalize popular intuition and management concepts for pathogen spillover, such as the inextricably multilevel nature of cross-species transmission, the impact of covariance between processes such as pathogen shedding and human susceptibility on spillover risk, and the assumptions under which the effect of a management intervention targeting one process, such as persistence of vectors, will translate to an equal effect on the overall spillover risk. Percolation models also link statistical analysis of spillover event datasets with a mechanistic model of spillover. Linear models, one might construct for process-specific parameters, such as the log-rate of shedding from one of several alternative reservoirs, yield a nonlinear model of the log-rate of spillover. The resulting nonlinearity is approximately piecewise linear with major impacts on statistical inferences of the importance of process-specific covariates such as vector density. We recommend that statistical analysis of spillover datasets use piecewise linear models, such as generalized additive models, regression clustering or ensembles of linear models, to capture the piecewise linearity expected from percolation models. We discuss the implications of our findings for predictions of spillover risk beyond the range of observed covariates, a major challenge of forecasting spillover risk in the Anthropocene.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. Quantifying how the environment shapes host immune defense is important for understanding which wild populations may be more susceptible or resistant to pathogens. Spatial variation in parasite risk, food and predator abundance, and abiotic conditions can each affect immunity, and these factors can also manifest at both local and biogeographic scales. Yet identifying predictors and the spatial scale of their effects is limited by the rarity of studies that measure immunity across many populations of broadly distributed species. We analyzed leukocyte profiles from 39 wild populations of the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) across its wide geographic range throughout the Neotropics. White blood cell differentials varied spatially, with proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes varying up to six-fold across sites. Leukocyte profiles were spatially autocorrelated at small and very large distances, suggesting that local environment and large-scale biogeographic factors influence cellular immunity. Generalized additive models showed that bat populations closer to the northern and southern limits of the species range had more neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils, but fewer lymphocytes and eosinophils, than bats sampled at the core of their distribution. Habitats with access to more livestock also showed similar patterns in leukocyte profiles, but large-scale patterns were partly confounded by time between capture and sampling across sites. Our findings suggest that populations at the edge of their range experience physiologically limiting conditions that predict higher chronic stress and greater investment in cellular innate immunity. High food abundance in livestock-dense habitats may exacerbate such conditions by increasing bat density or diet homogenization, although future spatially and temporally coordinated field studies with common protocols are needed to limit sampling artifacts. Systematically assessing immune function and response over space will elucidate how environmental conditions influence traits relevant to epidemiology and help predict disease risks with anthropogenic disturbance, land conversion, and climate change.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104034', 'afid': '60104034', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Piura', 'affiliation-city': 'Piura', 'affiliation-country': 'Peru'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073311', 'afid': '60073311', 'affilname': 'Leibniz-Institut für Zoo- und Wildtierforschung', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072007', 'afid': '60072007', 'affilname': 'Institut Pasteur de la Guyane', 'affiliation-city': 'Cayenne', 'affiliation-country': 'French Guiana'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071613', 'afid': '60071613', 'affilname': 'Universidad de la Republica Facultad de Medicina', 'affiliation-city': 'Montevideo', 'affiliation-country': 'Uruguay'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030718', 'afid': '60030718', 'affilname': 'Freie Universität Berlin', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851', 'afid': '60026851', 'affilname': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021121', 'afid': '60021121', 'affilname': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliation-city': 'Bloomington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017983', 'afid': '60017983', 'affilname': 'Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agricolas y Pecuarias', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Catarina', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007909', 'afid': '60007909', 'affilname': 'Universidad Veracruzana', 'affiliation-city': 'Xalapa', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563', 'afid': '60001563', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001490', 'afid': '60001490', 'affilname': 'University of Glasgow', 'affiliation-city': 'Glasgow', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120639791', 'afid': '120639791', 'affilname': 'Yunkawasi', 'affiliation-city': 'Lima', 'affiliation-country': 'Peru'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120135822', 'afid': '120135822', 'affilname': 'Association for the Conservation and Development of Natural Resources', 'affiliation-city': 'Lima', 'affiliation-country': 'Peru'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114380751', 'afid': '114380751', 'affilname': 'Programa de Conservación de Murciélagos de Perú (PCMP)', 'affiliation-city': 'Lima', 'affiliation-country': 'Peru'}]",Journal,Conference Paper,"['Becker D.J.', 'Nachtmann C.', 'Argibay H.D.', 'Botto G.', 'Escalera-Zamudio M.', 'Carrera J.E.', 'Tello C.', 'Winiarski E.', 'Greenwood A.D.', 'Méndez-Ojeda M.L.', 'Loza-Rubio E.', 'Lavergne A.', 'De Thoisy B.', 'Czirják G.', 'Plowright R.K.', 'Altizer S.', 'Streicker D.G.']","['56326134900', '57211906518', '55180660100', '57203767613', '35755235200', '57201262110', '57191404899', '57211908237', '7102457657', '56607255700', '8922498000', '57197599747', '55974141000', '36972142300', '15078101700', '6701756957', '57211970355']",,SICB,027/2014,Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB),,1716698

Modelling mechanisms of henipavirus circulation in fruit bat hosts,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,09628436,,14712970,374,1782,,2019-09-30,10.1098/rstb.2019.0021,"© 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Pathogen circulation among reservoir hosts is a precondition for zoonotic spillover. Unlike the acute, high morbidity infections typical in spillover hosts, infected reservoir hosts often exhibit low morbidity and mortality. Although it has been proposed that reservoir host infections may be persistent with recurrent episodes of shedding, direct evidence is often lacking. We construct a generalized SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) framework encompassing 46 sub-models representing the full range of possible transitions among those four states of infection and immunity. We then use likelihood-based methods to fit these models to nine years of longitudinal data on henipavirus serology from a captive colony of Eidolon helvum bats in Ghana. We find that reinfection is necessary to explain observed dynamics; that acute infectious periods may be very short (hours to days); that immunity, if present, lasts about 1-2 years; and that recurring latent infection is likely. Although quantitative inference is sensitive to assumptions about serology, qualitative predictions are robust. Our novel approach helps clarify mechanisms of viral persistence and circulation in wild bats, including estimated ranges for key parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the duration of the infectious period. Our results inform how future field-based and experimental work could differentiate the processes of viral recurrence and reinfection in reservoir hosts.

The 2018 outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala, India, highlights the need for global surveillance of henipaviruses in bats, which are the reservoir hosts for this and other viruses. Nipah virus, an emerging paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus, causes severe disease and stuttering chains of transmission in humans and is considered a potential pandemic threat. In May 2018, an outbreak of Nipah virus began in Kerala, > 1800 km from the sites of previous outbreaks in eastern India in 2001 and 2007. Twenty-three people were infected and 21 people died (16 deaths and 18 cases were laboratory confirmed). Initial surveillance focused on insectivorous bats (Megaderma spasma), whereas follow-up surveys within Kerala found evidence of Nipah virus in fruit bats (Pteropus medius). P. medius is the confirmed host in Bangladesh and is now a confirmed host in India. However, other bat species may also serve as reservoir hosts of henipaviruses. To inform surveillance of Nipah virus in bats, we reviewed and analyzed the published records of Nipah virus surveillance globally. We applied a trait-based machine learning approach to a subset of species that occur in Asia, Australia, and Oceana. In addition to seven species in Kerala that were previously identified as Nipah virus seropositive, we identified at least four bat species that, on the basis of trait similarity with known Nipah virus-seropositive species, have a relatively high likelihood of exposure to Nipah or Nipah-like viruses in India. These machine-learning approaches provide the first step in the sequence of studies required to assess the risk of Nipah virus spillover in India.

Hibernation, a physiological state characterized by depressed metabolism and body temperature, is critical to winter survival and reproduction, and therefore has been extensively quantified and modeled. Hibernation consists of alternating phases of extended periods of torpor (low body temperature, low metabolic rate), and energetically costly periodic arousals to normal body temperature. Arousals consist of multiple phases: warming, euthermia, and cooling. Warming and euthermic costs are regularly included in energetic models, but although cooling to torpid body temperature is an important phase of the torpor-arousal cycle, it is often overlooked in energetic models. When included, cooling cost is assumed to be 67% of warming cost, an assumption originally derived from a single study that measured cooling cost in ground squirrels. Since this study, the same proportional value has been assumed across a variety of hibernating species. However, no additional values have been derived. We derived a model of cooling cost from first principles and validated the model with empirical energetic measurements. We compared the assumed 67% proportional cooling cost with our model-predicted cooling cost for 53 hibernating mammals. Our results indicate that using 67% of warming cost only adequately represents cooling cost in ground squirrel-sized mammals. In smaller species, this value overestimates cooling cost and in larger species, the value underestimates cooling cost. Our model allows for the generalization of energetic costs for multiple species using species-specific physiological and morphometric parameters, and for predictions over variable environmental conditions.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021285', 'afid': '60021285', 'affilname': 'Texas Tech University', 'affiliation-city': 'Lubbock', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008221', 'afid': '60008221', 'affilname': 'Massey University Manawatu', 'affiliation-city': 'Palmerston North', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001012', 'afid': '60001012', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Haase C.', 'Fuller N.', 'Hranac C.', 'Hayman D.', 'Olson S.', 'Plowright R.', 'McGuire L.']","['57057214700', '50161507700', '57206780810', '24376017100', '55574244943', '15078101700', '26867876500']",Bats | Cooling | Energetic model | Hibernation | Torpor | Winter survival,NSF,DEB-1716698,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0306456518303504,1716698

Understanding how variation in immunity drives pathogen transmission among species is especially important for animals that are reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens. Bats, in particular, have a propensity to host serious viral zoonoses without developing clinical disease themselves. The immunological adaptations that allow bats to host viruses without disease may be related to their adaptations for flight (e.g., in metabolism and mediation of oxidative stress). A number of analyses report greater richness of zoonotic pathogens in bats than in other taxa, such as birds (i.e., mostly volant vertebrates) and rodents (i.e., nonvolant small mammals), but immunological comparisonsbetween bats and these other taxa are rare. To examine interspecific differences in bacterial killing ability (BKA), a functional measure of overall constitutive innate immunity, we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to compare how BKA responds to the acute stress of capture and to storage time of frozen samples across the orders Aves and Chiroptera. After adjusting for host phylogeny, sample size, and total microbe colony-forming units, we find preliminary evidence that the constitutive innate immune defense of bats may be more resilient to handling stress and storage time than that of birds. This pattern was also similar when we analyzed the proportion of nonnegative and positive effect sizes per species, using phylogenetic comparative methods. We discuss potential physiological and evolutionary mechanisms by which complement proteins may differ between species orders and suggest future avenues for comparative field studies of immunity between sym-patric bats, birds, and rodents in particular.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073311', 'afid': '60073311', 'affilname': 'Leibniz-Institut für Zoo- und Wildtierforschung', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Becker D.', 'Czirják G.', 'Rynda-Apple A.', 'Plowright R.']","['56326134900', '36972142300', '36841371400', '15078101700']",Acute stress | Bacterial killing ability | Bacterial killing assay | Ecoimmunology | Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 | Innate immunity | Wildlife,NSF,DEB-1716698,National Science Foundation,,1716698

All rights reserved. Bats provide important ecosystem services such as pollination of native forests; they are also a source of zoonotic pathogens for humans and domestic animals. Human-induced changes to native habitats may have created more opportunities for bats to reside in urban settings, thus decreasing pollination services to native forests and increasing opportunities for zoonotic transmission. In Australia, fruit bats (Pteropus spp. flying foxes) are increasingly inhabiting urban areas where they feed on anthropogenic food sources with nutritional characteristics and phenology that differ from native habitats. We use optimal foraging theory to investigate the relationship between bat residence time in a patch, the time it takes to search for a new patch (simulating loss of native habitat) and seasonal resource production. We show that it can be beneficial to reside in a patch, even when food productivity is low, as long as foraging intensity is low and the expected searching time is high. A small increase in the expected patch searching time greatly increases the residence time, suggesting nonlinear associations between patch residence and loss of seasonal native resources. We also found that sudden increases in resource consumption due to an influx of new bats has complex effects on patch departure times that again depend on expected searching times and seasonality. Our results suggest that the increased use of urban landscapes by bats may be a response to new spatial and temporal configurations of foraging opportunities. Given that bats are reservoir hosts of zoonotic diseases, our results provide a framework to study the effects of foraging ecology on disease dynamics.

We found that watersheds with excellent and good availability of excess surface water are primarily in the Sacramento River Basin and northern San Joaquin Valley. STARR is available as a web tool and can guide water managers on where and when excess surface water is available and, with other web tools, help sustainable groundwater agencies develop plans to balance water demand and aquifer recharge.

Journal of Ecology © 2014 British Ecological Society. 1. The vegetation of semi-arid and arid landscapes is often comprised of mixtures of herbaceous and woody vegetation. Since the early 1900s, shifts from herbaceous to woody plant dominance, termed woody plant encroachment and widely regarded as a state change, have occurred world-wide. This shift presents challenges to the conservation of grassland and savanna ecosystems and to animal production in commercial ranching systems and pastoral societies. 2. Dryland management focused on cattle and sheep grazing has historically attempted to reduce the abundance of encroaching woody vegetation (hereafter, 'brush management') with the intent of reversing declines in forage production, stream flow or groundwater recharge. Here, we assess the known and potential consequences of brush management actions, both positive and negative, on a broader suite of ecosystem services, the scientific challenges to quantifying these services and the trade-offs among them. 3. Our synthesis suggests that despite considerable investments accompanying the application of brush management practices, the recovery of key ecosystem services may be short-lived or absent. However, in the absence of such interventions, those and other ecosystem services may be compromised, and the persistence of grassland and savanna ecosystem types and their endemic plants and animals threatened. 4. Addressing the challenges posed by woody plant encroachment will require integrated management systems using diverse theoretical principles to design the type, timing and spatial arrangement of initial management actions and follow-up treatments. These management activities will need to balance cultural traditions and preferences, socio-economic constraints and potentially competing land-use objectives. 5. Synthesis. Our ability to predict ecosystem responses to management aimed at recovering ecosystem services where grasslands and savannas have been invaded by native or exotic woody plants is limited for many attributes (e.g. primary production, land surface-atmosphere interactions, biodiversity conservation) and inconsistent for others (e.g. forage production, herbaceous diversity, water quality/quantity, soil erosion, carbon sequestration). The ecological community is challenged with generating robust information about the response of ecosystem services and their interactions if we are to position land managers and policymakers to make objective, science-based decisions regarding the many trade-offs and competing objectives for the conservation and dynamic management of grasslands and savannas.",49,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Archer S.', 'Predick K.']","['7202456825', '6504186411']",Bush clearing | Drylands | Ecosystem services | Shrub encroachment | State change | Vegetation change | Woody plant encroachment | Woody weeds,NSF,DEB-0816162,National Science Foundation,,1413900

Rangelands in the Southern Great Plains of the United States have been undergoing a rapid transition from herbaceous to woody dominance, primarily owing to encroachment by eastern redcedar, an evergreen juniper species (Juniperus virginiana). Experimental observations at the watershed scale have indicated that conversion of rangelands to eastern redcedar woodlands significantly reduces streamflows. However, whether there are similar effects at larger scales is not known. To address this question, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to simulate changes to the water budget resulting from woody plant encroachment for the lower Cimarron River basin in central Oklahoma. This simulation was based on a hypothetic scenario whereby rangelands in the river basin (51% of the area) were completely replaced by eastern redcedar woodland while other land-use types remained unchanged. The model performed better in simulating the daily streamflow dynamics of the Cimarron River when calibrated with data from the watershed-scale experiments than when calibrated with basin streamflow data. Our results indicate that eastern redcedar encroachment would lead to reduced streamflow throughout the year, with the largest reduction in April and May, due mainly to much smaller surface run-off. The magnitude of streamflow reduction varies along the precipitation gradient. We estimate that under the climate conditions of the period 1988–2009, complete conversion of the rangelands to eastern redcedar woodlands would result in reductions of up to 40% in annual streamflow for the drier, upper portion of the basin, and approximately 20% for the entire basin.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Rainfall partitioning and redistribution by canopies are important ecohydrological processes underlying ecosystem dynamics. We quantified and contrasted spatial and temporal variations of rainfall redistribution for a juniper (Juniperus virginiana, redcedar) woodland and a tallgrass prairie in the south-central Great Plains, USA. Our results showed that redcedar trees had high canopy storage capacity (S) ranging from 2.14 mm for open stands to 3.44 mm for closed stands. The canopy funneling ratios (F) of redcedar trees varied substantially among stand type and tree size. The open stands and smaller trees usually had higher F values and were more efficient in partitioning rainfall into stemflow. Larger trees were more effective in partitioning rainfall into throughfall and no significant changes in the total interception ratios among canopy types and tree size were found. The S values were highly variable for tallgrass prairie, ranging from 0.27 mm at early growing season to 3.86 mm at senescence. As a result, the rainfall interception by tallgrass prairie was characterized by high temporal instability. On an annual basis, our results showed no significant difference in total rainfall loss to canopy interception between redcedar trees and tallgrass prairie. Increasing structural complexity associated with redcedar encroachment into tallgrass prairie changes the rainfall redistribution and partitioning pattern at both the temporal and spatial scales, but does not change the overall canopy interception ratios compared with unburned and ungrazed tallgrass prairie. Our findings support the idea of convergence in interception ratio for different canopy structures under the same precipitation regime. The temporal change in rainfall interception loss from redcedar encroachment is important to understand how juniper encroachment will interact with changing rainfall regime and potentially alter regional streamflow under climate change.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006028', 'afid': '60006028', 'affilname': 'UNESP-Universidade Estadual Paulista', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zou C.B.', 'Caterina G.L.', 'Will R.E.', 'Stebler E.', 'Turton D.']","['23570300900', '55918694000', '7101899361', '6504808804', '7004168590']",,EPSCoR,NSF-1301789,Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research,,1413900

Grassland to woodland conversion, also known as woody plant encroachment (WPE), is a global-scale phenomena caused in large part by changes in social processes that affect rural land use patterns. Woody plant encroachment has raised serious concerns for species conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and viability of rural livelihoods and cultures. We examined the social drivers of WPE using a case study of rangelands in a semi-arid watershed. We employed the life course framework to understand how ranchers have made land ranch management decisions in the context of time, culture, and social change. We interviewed landowners whose families have been on the land for at least two generations to examine (1) the social context influencing a landowner’s decision to increase or decrease their involvement in ranching over their life span, and (2) the historical events that facilitated constrained involvement. We relate these changes in involvement to the expansion of woody plants. Three major turning points were related to changes in ranching involvement: graduating high school, retirement, and infirmity of a parent. We found that changes in ranching involvement were influenced by large-scale shifts in culture, market regulations, and land values throughout the 20th century. These shifts led to three behavioral changes on the land that facilitated WPE: (1) changes in livestock following the collapse of the sheep and goat market, (2) increased popularity of hunting, and (3) decreased labor availability on the ranch. These observations illustrate the complex social and ecological forces at work throughout the 20th century that have led to land transformation in central Texas.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hurst K.', 'Ramsdell C.', 'Sorice M.']","['57193812885', '56845394500', '10440051600']",Grassland conservation | Land use change | Life histories,NIFA,1007271,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1413900

Large tracts of grassland in the Great Plains, USA have been converted to cropland since the early 1900s, and woodlands are rapidly encroaching into many grasslands of the region due to changes in land management practices. Changes in the arrangement and proportion of different land cover types can affect biodiversity. We used bird survey data to identify the effect of land cover change on breeding bird ranges within the Great Plains over a 10-year period. Each species was categorized into one of the following habitat guilds: grassland, shrubland, woodland, wetland and generalist. We calculated the proportion of each land cover (including cropland, grassland, woodland, developed, barren, water bodies and wetlands) within a 1.6 km radius of each bird survey starting point. Within an occupancy modeling framework, we estimated colonization and extinction rates for each species and averaged them to the guild level. We also quantified changes in land cover from grassland to other cover types. Results show that grasslands were mostly converted to cropland and woodland, which were accompanied by positive extinction rates for certain grassland species. Extinction rates at the guild level were unrelated to increases in any land cover type, and observed land cover changes largely favored the shrubland guild. Overall, habitat-guild responses show little influence of woodland or cropland expansion at regional scales, although certain species ranges are predicted to decrease with increases in woodland.

Here, we synthesize the literature reporting effects of brush management on wildlife and make recommendations for applying brush management to accomplish wildlife conservation objectives. Key observations arising from our synthesis are that habitat-related terminology is often misused in brush management literature. Recommending brush management as a “wildlife habitat improvement” tool is a non sequitur because habitat is species specific and brush management has different consequences for different species of wildlife and plants. Communication between resource managers and stakeholders can be improved by making it clear that habitat is species specific and then identifying what constitutes a benefit of brush management. Changes in resources resulting from brush management may not benefit targeted wildlife species unless these changes overcome some limiting factor or factors. Wildlife responses to brush management treatments are too complex to make broad generalizations because they are mediated by environmental factors and depend on the plant community, size and configuration of the area manipulated, type of treatment applied, and time since application. Prescriptions aimed at improving habitat for wildlife generalists may have relatively modest positive effects on that group but have potentially detrimental effects on specialists. Given this potential trade-off, an idea to consider is that it may be best to err on the side of using brush management as a tool to manage habitat for specialists. Brush management plans and recommendations should take into account trade-offs such as benefiting grassland wildlife at the expense of woodland species. Taking a broader “systems” perspective that balances needs of wildlife in conjunction with other ecosystem services affected by woody plant encroachment and brush management should be a goal of natural resource managers.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001989', 'afid': '60001989', 'affilname': 'USDA Agricultural Research Service, Washington DC', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fulbright T.E.', 'Davies K.W.', 'Archer S.R.']","['7003302203', '57203178147', '7202456825']",biodiversity | grassland | habitat | rangeland | savanna | shrubland,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1550742417300702,1413900

Leaf litter interception of water is an integral component of the water budget for some vegetated ecosystems. However, loss of rainfall to litter receives considerably less attention than canopy interception due to lack of suitable sensors to measure changes in litter water content. In this study, a commercially available leaf wetness sensor was calibrated to the gravimetric water content of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) litter and used to estimate litter interception in a subhumid eastern redcedar woodland in north-central Oklahoma. Under controlled laboratory conditions, a strong positive correlation between the leaf wetness sensor output voltage (mV) and measured gravimetric litter water content (ϴg) was determined: ϴg = (.0009 × mV2) − (0.14 × mV) − 11.41 (R2 =.94, p <.0001). This relationship was validated with field sampling and the output voltage (mV) accounted for 48% of the observed variance in the measured water content. The maximum and minimum interception storage capacity ranged between 1.16 and 12.04 and 1.12 and 9.62 mm, respectively. The maximum and minimum amount of intercepted rain was positively correlated to rainfall amount and intensity. The continuous field measurements demonstrated that eastern redcedar litter intercepted approximately 8% of the gross rainfall that fell between December 16, 2014 and May 31, 2015. Therefore, rainfall loss to litter can constitute a substantial component of the annual water budget. Long-term in situ measurement of litter interception loss is necessary to gain a better estimate of water availability for streamflow and recharge. This is critical to manage water resources in the south-central Great Plains, USA where grasslands are rapidly being transformed to woodland or woody dominated savanna.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022149', 'afid': '60022149', 'affilname': 'Tianjin Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tianjin', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Acharya B.S.', 'Stebler E.', 'Zou C.B.']","['55141033800', '6504808804', '23570300900']",gravimetric litter water content | interception storage capacity | Juniperus virginiana | leaf wetness sensor | litter interception | water budget,NSF,2014-67010-216530,National Science Foundation,,1413900

Information on the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture in the vadose zone is important to assess groundwater recharge and solute transport in unconsolidated substrate as influenced by biological processes. Time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was used to monitor soil moisture dynamics to a depth of 9 m in a grassland, a grassland encroached by a juniper species (eastern redcedar, Juniperus virginiana), a juniper woodland and an oak forest in the south-central Great Plains, Oklahoma, USA. A site-specific relationship between moisture content and electrical conductivity data was developed for the soil zone, and a perched water zone was monitored at two of the sites. Results showed that (a) change in soil moisture content was linearly correlated to change in electric conductivity in the soil zone; (b) vegetation cover type induced differences in vertical bulk electrical resistivity (ER) profiles and influenced the temporal evolution of soil moisture profiles; and (c) juniper encroachment lowered the water level in the perched groundwater aquifer. Our results suggest land use and vegetation cover type, as opposed to rock properties, controls deep water drainage for the vegetation transition zone.

Woody cover encroachment/expansion/conversion is a complex phenomenon that has environmental and economic impacts around the world. This research demonstrates the development of highly accurate models for estimating percent woody cover using high spatial resolution image data in combination with multi-seasonal Landsat reflectance products. We use a classification and regression tree (CART) approach to classify woody cover using fine resolution multispectral National Agricultural Imaging Program (NAIP) data. A continuous classification and regression tree (Cubist) ingests the aggregated woody cover classification along with the seasonal Landsat data to create a continuous woody cover model. We applied the models, derived by Cubist, across several Landsat scenes to estimate the percentage of woody plant cover, within each Landsat pixel, over a larger regional extent. We measured an average absolute error of 12.1 percent and a correlation coefficient of 0.78 for the models performed. The method of modelling percent woody cover established in this manuscript outperforms currently available woody cover estimates including Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), on average by 26 percent, andWeb-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) products, on average by 16 percent, for the region of interest.

Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation are projected for most U.S. regions under climate change. There is a high degree of uncertainty, however, in precipitation regime changes across the large precipitation gradient of the Arkansas Red River basin (ARRB). The authors analyzed future precipitation regimes using two statistical downscaling datasets based on the scenarios from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Seasonal precipitation in low-to-high quantiles was calculated and compared for the southern ARRB where the downscaled data were available. The results showed a generally comparable shift in precipitation patterns and amounts between the two datasets. However, some spatial variation of precipitation amount change exists, and the direction of change could be opposite for the summer. Both datasets showed that the top 10% of monthly precipitation amounts could increase for the southern ARRB, mostly ranging from 5-10 mm month-1 for the early part of the century (2010-39) to 15-30 mm month-1 for the midcentury (2040-69) as compared with the historical period (1968-97). The maximum monthly precipitation could increase by up to 150 mm in both datasets by the midcentury. Precipitation was projected to increase regardless of quantile during both winter and spring but tended to decrease during summer and autumn. More-frequent and higher-intensity rainfall events were expected for the eastern part of the basin, and longer and drier dry periods were expected for the western basin. Conservation strategies and sustainable water management should consider the regional differences in the projected changes in precipitation regimes for the basin under climate change.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030931', 'afid': '60030931', 'affilname': 'University of Oklahoma', 'affiliation-city': 'Norman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qiao L.', 'Zou C.B.', 'Gaitán C.F.', 'Hong Y.', 'McPherson R.A.']","['55547281400', '23570300900', '55450455800', '8632797000', '7102811733']",Climate change | Climate variability | Precipitation | Statistical forecasting | Statistical techniques,USGS,OIA-1301789,U.S. Geological Survey,,1413900

The emergence of large-scale fire classifications and products informed by remote sensing data has enabled opportunities to include variability or heterogeneity as part of modern fire regime classifications. Currently, basic fire metrics such as mean fire return intervals are calculated without considering spatial variance in a management context. Fire return intervals are also only applicable at a particular grain size (defined as the spatial unit of interest) even though they are typically applied homogeneously. In this study, we utilized a 29-yr fire occurrence database to show how spatial variance changes with respect to grain as postulated by Wiens () when reporting fire patterns within the Great Plains, USA. We utilized data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database of fire occurrence for the years 1984–2012. We analyzed median numbers of fire along with their variance at four spatial grains ranging from small units (e.g., plots at 3 × 3 km resolution) to large units (e.g., landscapes at 1500 × 2700 km resolution). Median number of fire occurrences was consistently low, irrespective of grain. Despite the consistency in low median numbers of fires across grain, variance in the numbers of fires between units decreased. Variance within units, however, did not change as grain increased indicating fire-pattern-scale inconsistencies. Fire pattern interpretations depended entirely on the scale at which it is calculated. Given that the Great Plains region has a large disparity in fire patterns (i.e., some regions burn often, while others may never burn), fire regime classifications will benefit from including scale-specific variance estimates as a foundation for understanding changes in fire regimes and corresponding social–ecological and policy responses.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016933', 'afid': '60016933', 'affilname': 'US National Park Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015431', 'afid': '60015431', 'affilname': 'USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Sioux Falls', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013771', 'afid': '60013771', 'affilname': 'College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources', 'affiliation-city': 'Lincoln', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Scholtz R.', 'Fuhlendorf S.D.', 'Leis S.A.', 'Picotte J.J.', 'Twidwell D.']","['56237092600', '6701336850', '15728096600', '21735454800', '8763934100']",ecoregions | fire occurrence | mean fire return intervals | prescribed fire | wildfire,NSF,OIA-1301789,National Science Foundation,,1413900

Context: Woodland and agricultural expansion are major causes of grassland fragmentation. Fire and rainfall play important roles in maintaining grasslands, however, fire activity has been reduced in fragmented landscapes. Objectives: Quantify the degree to which basic landscape fragmentation metrics could be used as drivers of woody cover potential. Methods: Woody plant percent cover was calculated between 2004 and 2008 at > 2000 sites. At each site, we calculated these fragmentation metrics for grassland cover type (classified by the National Land Cover Database); # patches, landscape proportion, edge density, largest patch index, effective mesh size and patch cohesion index within 3 circular areas (10 km2, 360 km2 and 3600 km2) surrounding the sampling site. A quantile regression was performed to identify which metrics were useful at predicting the 25th, 50th, 75th or 95th quantile of woody cover distribution. Results: Grassland proportion and edge density were significant predictors of the woody plant potential (75th and 95th quantile). Woody cover potential was positively associated with edge density suggesting that fragmented areas (i.e., areas with high number of edges) maintained higher woody cover, while grassland proportion was negatively associated with woody plant potential. Conclusion: We propose that in addition to a lack of fire, fragmented landscapes may facilitate further woodland expansion by reducing natural land and restricting grasslands to smaller, less connected patches, which can maintain higher woody cover. Given current trends in woodland expansion, special attention should be given to areas that are found within a fragmented landscape and climatically prone to woodland expansion.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Scholtz R.', 'Polo J.A.', 'Tanner E.P.', 'Fuhlendorf S.D.']","['56237092600', '55544602100', '56596335600', '6701336850']",Agriculture | Fire | Landscape connectivity | Patch dynamics | Woody encroachment,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1413900

Absentee landowners, who reside away from their rural property, are a growing segment of this changing social landscape. The implications of absentee ownership are not clearly understood, perhaps because the absentee concept is ambiguously defined and inconsistently specified. We introduce the construct of involvement with one's land to clarify and reframe the absentee landowner concept. We analyzed data from a mail survey of rangeland owners in central Texas to explore the relationship between absentee land ownership and the use of brush management to restore woody-plant invaded grasslands. We employed an information-theoretic approach to compare candidate models using indicators of absenteeism (permanent residence on land and distance of permanent residence from land) and involvement. We measured involvement with one's land as hours per week operating or working one's land. We conducted path analysis to examine the relationship between absenteeism and brush management as a function of involvement. Involvement in land management was the best predictor of brush management behavior. Absenteeism, as measured through presence-absence or as distance from land, had no relationship with brush management unless mediated by the involvement construct. Segmenting landowners based solely on the location of their full-time residence provides little information on brush management behavior because it neglects the relationship that landowners may have with their land, regardless of residency. The absentee landowner concept is central to understanding the dynamics of rangeland management and important to get right. Our analysis suggests that getting it right means knowing more than the location of the residence of the landowner.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sorice M.', 'Rajala K.', 'Kreuter U.']","['10440051600', '57201363434', '6701790538']",absentee landowners | amenity landowners | involvement | woody plant encroachment,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1550742417301768,1413900

Grasslands and open savannas are transitioning to shrub-dominated or tree-dominated landscapes. This phenomenon, often referred to as woody plant encroachment, is occurring globally. The outcomes of interactions among the various drivers of this change differ biogeographically; in semi-arid and subhumid regions they are often related to grazing-induced changes in fire regimes. Two important theoretical and conceptual frameworks are emerging that help us understand the underlying mechanisms of these transformations and inform approaches for maintaining and restoring grasslands and open savannas: alternative stable state theory (ASST) and pyric herbivory. Alternative stable state theory is a way of explaining, understanding, and predicting ecosystem state transitions in dual-life-form systems, and pyric herbivory is built on the notion that reciprocal, spatially distributed interactions between grazing and fire are a key to maintaining grassland and open savanna landscapes. Considered in tandem, ASST provides insights into rates and dynamics of grass–woody vegetation transitions, with pyric herbivory providing a conceptual basis for designing sustainable, site-specific management strategies.

The Tianshan Mountains are known as the “water tower” in the arid region of Central Asia. Change in precipitation amount and pattern can have a profound impact on regional civilization and life supporting ecosystems. For this study, a systematic analysis of long-term precipitation data for the eastern Tianshan Mountains was conducted to investigate the influence of climate teleconnections on annual and intra-annual precipitation using data collected between 1951 and 2014 from 39 meteorological stations. Annual precipitation has increased during the past six decades at an average rate of 6.7 mm/10 years largely due to the increase in precipitation during the intra-annual wet period (May–October). The annual precipitation and its rate of increase were higher in the northwestern region. Annual precipitation was found to be most strongly correlated with index of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), and partially correlated with indices of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Pacific North American Teleconnection Pattern (PNA), Arctic Oscillation (AO), El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). ISM was positively correlated with the precipitation in almost the entire region during the intra-annual wet period, while it showed positive correlations in the northern slope and the alpine region, and negative correlations in the southern slope during the intra-annual dry period (November to April).

Woody plant encroachment has profound impacts on the sustainable management of water resources in water-limited ecosystems. However, our understanding of the effects of this global phenomenon on groundwater recharge at local and regional scales is limited. Here, we reviewed studies related to (i) recharge estimation methods; (ii) mechanisms by which woody plants impact groundwater recharge; (iii) impacts of woody plant on recharge across different soil and geology; (iv) hydrological repercussions of woody plant removal; and (v) research gaps and needs for groundwater studies. We identified six different methods: water balance, water table, isotopes, chloride mass balance, electrical geophysical imaging, and modeling were used to study the impact of woody encroachment on groundwater. Woody plant encroachment could alter soil infiltration rates, soil water storage, transpiration, interception, and subsurface pathways to affect groundwater recharge. The impact is highly variable, with the extent and the magnitude varying across the soil, substrate, plant cover, and topographic locations. Our review revealed mixed effects of woody plant removal on groundwater recharge. Studies of litter interception, root water uptake, soil moisture dynamics, and deep percolation along with the progression of woody plant encroachment are still limited, warranting further experimental studies focusing on groundwater recharge. Overall, information about woody plant encroachment impacts on groundwater resources across a range of scales is essential for long-range planning of water resources.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/124261909', 'afid': '124261909', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University Agricultural Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Franklinton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Acharya B.S.', 'Kharel G.', 'Zou C.B.', 'Wilcox B.P.', 'Halihan T.']","['55141033800', '55441131900', '23570300900', '7101808282', '6507735668']",Central Great Plains | Eastern redcedar | Groundwater recharge | Karst | Sandstone | Woody plant removal,NSF,DEB-1413900,National Science Foundation,,1413900

Landscape change of this magnitude has several impacts perceived as negative on landscape processes, such as influencing fire regimes, habitat for wildlife, and hydrological processes. In southern Great Plains, Juniperus virginiana has been identified as a major contributor to woodland expansion. Adding to the perplexity of this phenomenon is its evidence on numerous landscape types on several continents, documented under varying climates. Our study aimed to quantify a direct treatment to reduce or slow down woodland expansion in an experimental rangeland in central Oklahoma, United States under three treatments: 1) herbicide, 2) fire with herbicide, and 3) control (no fire, no herbicide) within areas classified as “open grassland” in 1979. Thereafter, we identified these same areas in 2010 with remotely sensed imagery (Light Detection And Ranging) to quantify 1) total encroachment and 2) total encroachment by three size classes: a) small 1 − 2.5 m, b) intermediate 2.5 − 4.5 m and c) tall > 4.5 m. Overall, of the total area classified as grassland in 1979 (277.64 ha), 31% had been encroached by 2010. Encroachment was greatest in the control treatments, followed by herbicide-only treatment application and lowest in the fire and herbicide treatment with minor differences in mean plant height (4.11 m ± 0.28). Encroached areas were mostly dominated by tall individuals (45 ± 3.5%), followed by the intermediate-height class (31.53 ± 1.10%) and the least recorded in the smallest-height class (23.46 ± 2.29%), suggesting expansion occurred during the initial phases of treatment application. The costly practice of herbicide application did not provide a feasible solution to control further woodland expansion. However, when using herbicide with fire, woodland expansion was reduced, highlighting the effectiveness of early intervention by fire in reducing encroachment. This further supports landscape-scale studies highlighting the effect of fire to reduce woodland expansion.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Scholtz R.', 'Polo J.A.', 'Fuhlendorf S.D.', 'Engle D.M.', 'Weir J.R.']","['56237092600', '55544602100', '6701336850', '7004793852', '7102577946']",disturbance | encroachment niche | grasslands | juniper expansion | LiDAR | plant dynamics,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1550742417301082,1413900

In drylands, evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant ecohydrologic process. For this reason, partitioning of ET—determining the relative importance of interception (I), soil evaporation (E), and plant transpiration (T)—is critical, but remains a challenge. Recently, however, advances in measurement technologies and data availability have triggered an upsurge in in situ studies focused on quantifying T/ET. We carried out a meta-analysis of 38 datasets drawn from 31 studies done in drylands worldwide. This analysis showed that over the growing season, E and T are roughly equivalent for most natural ecosystems, whereas T/ET is higher in irrigated agro-ecosystems. With respect to factors controlling variations in T/ET, we found (1) no clear correlation for annual precipitation, soil texture, or ecosystem type; (2) leaf area index is a more significant controlling factor than fractional cover; and (3) T/ET varies most during dynamic wetting–drying episodes. We also found that controlling factors are different for E and T. Because these two processes differ in temporal dynamics, the factors controlling ET partitioning vary with temporal scale. Further, when interception and shallow groundwater are substantial, including these factors is essential for accurate T/ET quantification. The isotopic approach, especially using laser spectroscopy, is now indispensable for such studies. However, issues related to sampling protocols and quality assurance still must be resolved. We propose three promising areas for future studies in drylands: (1) isotopic sampling of vadose-zone water vapor using laser spectroscopy; (2) improved definition/identification of diffusive pathways; and (3) robust upscaling from incongruent hydrometric and isotopic measurements.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sun X.', 'Wilcox B.P.', 'Zou C.B.']","['57203716955', '7101808282', '23570300900']",Drylands | Evaporation | Evapotranspiration partitioning | Hydrometric | Interception | Laser isotope spectroscopy | Leaf area index | Scaling | Stable isotope | Transpiration,,DEB-1413900,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022169419305736,1413900

All rights reserved. Grasslands and savannas worldwide have been dramatically altered by woody-plant encroachment (WPE). Maintaining remnant grasslands and restoring degraded grasslands for the people and animals that depend on them will require a new paradigm for WPE, one that views WPE as a complex social-ecological system. Here, we examine WPE in this light, using a conceptual framework designed to bridge the biophysical and social domains. On the basis of this press-pulse WPE framework, we develop a set of integrative hypotheses and identify key knowledge gaps using the Southern Great Plains as a case study. An alternative-and potentially complementary-approach to the press-pulse WPE framework is that of classical dynamic systems modeling, which has been widely adopted in ecology and economics. The explicit coupling of the press-pulse WPE framework with dynamic systems modeling has the potential to yield new insights for understanding the local- to regional-scale processes that drive and constrain changes in grass-woody plant abundances and for predicting the socioeconomic and ecological consequences of these changes.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Wilcox B.P.', 'Birt A.', 'Archer S.R.', 'Fuhlendorf S.D.', 'Kreuter U.P.', 'Sorice M.G.', 'Van Leeuwen W.J.D.', 'Zou C.B.']","['7101808282', '23501128200', '7202456825', '6701336850', '6701790538', '10440051600', '35612340000', '23570300900']",Disturbance ecology | Grasslands | Interdisciplinary science | Range science | Woodland ecology,,undefined,,,1413900

Natural resource agencies are responsible for managing specific aspects of the environment through the development and implementation of policies. Computational advances have emerged in recent years that provide opportunities for simulating the influence that agency structure has on policy outcomes, particularly those stemming from the area of network theory and analysis. However, there remains a need for methods that can measure and visualize the confounding effects that multiple agency characteristics may impose on policy implementation. The complex interactions among these factors require an approach that can evaluate these factors in relation to one another and provide a way to abstract meaningful findings that can be useful for both scientists and agencies to consider for future policy development. In this study, we present a network simulation modeling approach that (1) builds upon existing conceptualizations of bureaucrat decision-making within agency networks, (2) uses network theory to construct idealized natural resource agency networks that can be used to evaluate how agency structure influences policy implementation, and (3) visualizes simulation results to better understand how bureaucrat behaviors and relationships in concert with agency structure influence policy outcomes. Using this approach, we demonstrate how different aspects of decision-making by bureaucrats interact with the spatial constraints of institutional networks to influence policy outcomes.

The concept of resilience has permeated the discourse of many land use and environmental agencies in an attempt to articulate how to develop and implement policies concerned with the social and ecological dimensions of natural disturbances. Several distinct definitions of resilience exist, each with its own concepts, focus and contexts related to land use policy and management. This often makes understanding the inherent objectives of policies and related principles challenging. The United States Forest Service (USFS) is one example where ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding the use of resilience permeates the content of documents in various areas of the agency. The objective of this paper is to investigate how the USFS employs the term resilience as a means to communicate strategies for managing forest lands. We perform a content analysis of 121 USFS documents including budgetary justification reports, research findings (i.e., journal articles, book chapters and technical reports), public releases, and newsletters to analyze both the rise and specific use of the term resilience in the USFS. Our analysis, which is guided by definitions of resilience in the social-ecological systems literature, reveals that the ambiguity surrounding the use of resilience in the academic literature is reflected in the content of USFS documents. However, we also find that often criticized versions of resilience (namely engineering resilience) are minimally employed by the USFS, and instead the agency focuses on the notion of ecological resilience in which natural disturbances are seen as an important component of the landscape. In some cases, the USFS employs notions of social-ecological resilience, however, the extent to which specific components of social-ecological resilience are integrated into management strategies appears minimal. The findings from this study suggest that clarity regarding the type and function of resilience needs to improve in USFS documents, and that the agency should evaluate the existing question in the SES literature of resilience of what to what?",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bone C.', 'Moseley C.', 'Vinyeta K.', 'Bixler R.']","['14013775800', '7005222720', '55734512300', '55387354400']",Communities | Content analysis | Landscapes | Resilience | United States Forest Service,USDA,2011-67023-30695,U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837716000041,1414041

Native bark beetles and wildfire are among the most prominent natural disturbances in the conifer forests of western North America. Using multiple approaches and scales, researchers have sought to understand how each disturbance may, or may not, influence the subsequent likelihood or severity of the other disturbance. Our objectives were to complement existing research on the linkage of mountain pine beetle and wildfire disturbances by combining large-scale spatial data at variable temporal resolutions to characterize the discrepancy between observed and expected overlap areas of fire and beetle disturbances. Multiple time lags, differing by 1-yr intervals, spanning the 30-yr period 1984-2014 in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon were examined for wildfire following bark beetle epidemics and for beetle epidemics following wildfire. We used existing spatial data sets of wildfires and insect pest disturbances to perform overlay analyses to characterize the two relationships. We also compared years of peak vs. non-peak fires, as well as the influence of several individual, large disturbances. We found a clear association of increased bark beetle epidemic shortly after wildfire. The evidence of an association between increased fire extent and severity following bark beetle epidemics was less straightforward, although it suggested that the nature of the observed patterns varied with fire severity. In some cases, individual disturbance seasons or events were highly influential on the overall trends.

Natural resource agencies are responsible for managing specific aspects of the environment through the development and implementation of policies. Computational advances have emerged in recent years that provide opportunities for simulating the influence that agency structure has on policy outcomes, particularly those stemming from the area of network theory and analysis. However, there remains a need for methods that can measure and visualize the confounding effects that multiple agency characteristics may impose on policy implementation. The complex interactions among these factors require an approach that can evaluate these factors in relation to one another and provide a way to abstract meaningful findings that can be useful for both scientists and agencies to consider for future policy development. In this study, we present a network simulation modeling approach that (1) builds upon existing conceptualizations of bureaucrat decision-making within agency networks, (2) uses network theory to construct idealized natural resource agency networks that can be used to evaluate how agency structure influences policy implementation, and (3) visualizes simulation results to better understand how bureaucrat behaviors and relationships in concert with agency structure influence policy outcomes. Using this approach, we demonstrate how different aspects of decision-making by bureaucrats interact with the spatial constraints of institutional networks to influence policy outcomes. The network modeling and visualization methods presented here offer an alternative approach in the policy science toolbox that can help generate new assumptions and questions about the ways in which natural resources are governed.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kenbeek S.', 'Bone C.', 'Moseley C.']","['56374088300', '14013775800', '7005222720']",Natural resource management | Network modeling | Public policy implementation | Social networks,NSF,1414041,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0198971516300114,1414041

The concept of resilience has permeated the discourse of many land use and environmental agencies in an attempt to articulate how to develop and implement policies concerned with the social and ecological dimensions of natural disturbances. Several distinct definitions of resilience exist, each with its own concepts, focus and contexts related to land use policy and management. This often makes understanding the inherent objectives of policies and related principles challenging. The United States Forest Service (USFS) is one example where ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding the use of resilience permeates the content of documents in various areas of the agency. The objective of this paper is to investigate how the USFS employs the term resilience as a means to communicate strategies for managing forest lands. We perform a content analysis of 121 USFS documents including budgetary justification reports, research findings (i.e., journal articles, book chapters and technical reports), public releases, and newsletters to analyze both the rise and specific use of the term resilience in the USFS. Our analysis, which is guided by definitions of resilience in the social-ecological systems literature, reveals that the ambiguity surrounding the use of resilience in the academic literature is reflected in the content of USFS documents. However, we also find that often criticized versions of resilience (namely engineering resilience) are minimally employed by the USFS, and instead the agency focuses on the notion of ecological resilience in which natural disturbances are seen as an important component of the landscape. In some cases, the USFS employs notions of social-ecological resilience, however, the extent to which specific components of social-ecological resilience are integrated into management strategies appears minimal. The findings from this study suggest that clarity regarding the type and function of resilience needs to improve in USFS documents, and that the agency should evaluate the existing question in the SES literature of resilience of what to what?",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bone C.', 'Moseley C.', 'Vinyeta K.', 'Bixler R.']","['14013775800', '7005222720', '55734512300', '55387354400']",Communities | Content analysis | Landscapes | Resilience | United States Forest Service,USDA,2011-67023-30695,U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837716000041,1414041

Landscape-scale forest disturbance events have become increasingly common worldwide under the combined influences of climate change and ecosystem modification. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic that swept through North American forests from the late 1990s through the early 2010s was one of the largest such disturbance events on record and triggered shocks to ecological and economic systems. We analyze the policy and governance responses to this event by focusing on three national forests in the state of Colorado and on the agency responsible for their management, the U.S. Forest Service. We found that the event triggered the formation of new hybrid agency/nonagency organizations that contributed both legitimacy and capacity to address the most immediate threats to human safety and infrastructure. Despite the use of a highly networked governance structure, longstanding U.S. Forest Service institutions continued to heavily influence the scope of the response and the means for implementing management activities. We detected relatively limited institutional response at the level of the agency as a whole, even as regional- and local-scale institutions within Colorado showed greater dynamism. Indeed, the changes to agency institutions that were detected were largely consistent with institutional change trajectories already in place prior to the epidemic. Our study points to the importance of institutional persistence and path dependence in limiting the latitude for adaptation to social and environmental shocks.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003122', 'afid': '60003122', 'affilname': 'University of Victoria', 'affiliation-city': 'Victoria', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Abrams J.B.', 'Huber-Stearns H.R.', 'Bone C.', 'Grummon C.A.', 'Moseley C.']","['15520754500', '55863963000', '14013775800', '57194560741', '7005222720']",Adaptive capacity | Bark beetle | Bureaucracy | Institutional change | U.S. Forest Service,NSF,1414041,National Science Foundation,,1414041

We apply content analysis on government documents containing ecological information relevant to a significant ecological disturbance - mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks in the United States. The intent is to demonstrate a semi-automated approach that applies topic modeling to investigate policy responses to ecological disturbances, using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), and term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) analysis. Results demonstrate how analysts and researchers are better able to understand what topics and focus areas government officials consider in relation to MPB disturbances. In the case study demonstrating the method's utility, documents found from before 1960 and until recent years demonstrate focus on outbreak area, tree mortality, research and services, management, infestation, outbreak control, fire, insect control, outbreak factors, and tree population. Terms such as fire, mortality, treatment, and outbreak reflect more recent U.S. government focus on MPB, while disease and infestation have become less of a focus in recent years. There are also varying differences and interests between how different parts (i.e., federal agencies versus congress) of the U.S. government focus on MPB, where mostly interests and focus are not aligned or do not match temporally. As a term, temperature has become a greater recent government focus, but there is general avoidance of the term climate change. The methods applied demonstrate the utility of topic modeling and tf-idf for understanding discourse and content in policy related to ecological disturbances.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Federal policies related to forestry and forest health (specifically, insects and diseases) have the potential to affect management practices, terms of international and interstate trade, and long-term sustainability and conservation. Our objectives were to review existing federal policies, the role of federal agencies in managing forest health, and guidance for future policy efforts. Since the 1940s, various federal policies relevant to forest health have been established, and several US Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies have been empowered to assist with prevention, quarantine, detection, management, and control of insects and diseases. Overall, our review showed that relatively few national policies directly address forest health as a stand-alone objective, as most of them are embedded within forestry bills. Federal funding for forest health issues and the number of personnel dedicated to such issues have declined dramatically for some agencies. Concomitantly, native species continue to gain pestiferous status while non-native species continue to establish and cause impacts in the US. To enhance our ability and capacity to deal with current and future threats, concerted efforts are needed to advocate for both resources and stand-alone policy tools that take seriously the complexity of emerging sustainability challenges in both private and public forestlands",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009225', 'afid': '60009225', 'affilname': 'Savannah River Ecology Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Aiken', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122725862', 'afid': '122725862', 'affilname': 'Center for Invasive Species Protection', 'affiliation-city': 'Springfield', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gandhi K.', 'Campbell F.', 'Abrams J.']","['7007022283', '56373321200', '15520754500']",Federal policy | Forest disease | Forest insects,NSF,1414041,National Science Foundation,,1414041

We used an agent based cellular model of coupled beetle and host tree populations to investigate the effects on long-term population dynamics of modifying three model components, representing factors that land managers have varying degrees of control over: number of host trees, health of host trees, and number of surviving beetle offspring. Within the parameter space, various behavior types emerged in the simulations: population crashes, regular endemic/epidemic cycles, and sporadic cycles. The largest, recurring epidemics occurred in simulations with dense populations of mostly vigorous trees and moderately high beetle offspring production. The fewest epidemics occurred with low beetle reproduction, and low tree population density. With all other factors held constant, reducing the tree population below a threshold reduced the proportion of cells experiencing beetle population epidemics. These results are consistent with field observations of reduced tree losses to beetle epidemics in thinned forest stands. The long-term simulations used in this study provide novel insights not captured by single-epidemic simulations, such as the fact that it was very difficult to maintain endemic populations for long periods, and that epidemics tended to be more erratic at higher tree densities.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028609', 'afid': '60028609', 'affilname': 'Argonne National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Lemont', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022148', 'afid': '60022148', 'affilname': 'UCL', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003122', 'afid': '60003122', 'affilname': 'University of Victoria', 'affiliation-city': 'Victoria', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Nelson M.', 'Murphy J.', 'Bone C.', 'Altaweel M.']","['56816216600', '55678855600', '14013775800', '15031245100']",Agent-based model | Cellular model | Dendroctonus ponderosae | Mountain pine beetle,NSF,1414041,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1476945X18300126,1414041

Native bark beetles and wildfire are among the most prominent natural disturbances in the conifer forests of western North America. Using multiple approaches and scales, researchers have sought to understand how each disturbance may, or may not, influence the subsequent likelihood or severity of the other disturbance. Our objectives were to complement existing research on the linkage of mountain pine beetle and wildfire disturbances by combining large-scale spatial data at variable temporal resolutions to characterize the discrepancy between observed and expected overlap areas of fire and beetle disturbances. Multiple time lags, differing by 1-yr intervals, spanning the 30-yr period 1984-2014 in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon were examined for wildfire following bark beetle epidemics and for beetle epidemics following wildfire. We used existing spatial data sets of wildfires and insect pest disturbances to perform overlay analyses to characterize the two relationships. We also compared years of peak vs. non-peak fires, as well as the influence of several individual, large disturbances. We found a clear association of increased bark beetle epidemic shortly after wildfire. The evidence of an association between increased fire extent and severity following bark beetle epidemics was less straightforward, although it suggested that the nature of the observed patterns varied with fire severity. In some cases, individual disturbance seasons or events were highly influential on the overall trends. Variability in the results highlights the challenges of quantifying landscape-level relationships among disturbance types and supports the existing calls for further analyses with additional ecological variables.

Nonetheless, after a careful consideration of the study domain and the available hydroclimatic and soil data in the study area, we have concluded that in fact it is reasonable to run the hydraulic model without including rainfall. Existing literature on the Logone Floodplain suggests that much of the early rainfall infiltrates into soils and evaporates quickly. Note that total rainfall over the floodplain is less than one meter per year, whereas annual PET has been estimated as high as three meters per year. Previous studies noted that the soils in the area are clays (this is consistent with the SoilGrids1km described in Hengl et al., 2014) and exhibit surface sealing, but also refer to large cracks in the clays, which would need to fill with water prior to sealing (Naah, 1990). Infiltration and subsequent evaporation from bare soils is not handled in the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model that we used. To the extent that this process is important, we would argue that it is better to simply leave precipitation out of the hydraulic simulations. Consistent with previous studies (e.g. Evans and Loth, 2004) we believe that the main function of rainfall over the floodplain is to allow saturation of the soil a few weeks before the overbank flow, thus facilitating, but not controlling, the water movement on the floodplain. Accounting for this effect in the LISFLOOD-FP model requires knowledge of infiltration rates at high spatial resolution, which is currently infeasible in this region of Cameroon.

Natural floodplains are complex social-ecological systems in which human livelihoods are tightly coupled with flooding dynamics. In this paper, we argue that hydraulic planning in such systems, including to mitigate extreme floods, must consider three key features of adaptive self-organizing systems in floodplains - connectivity, learning feedbacks, and rhythms - to support the resilience of floodplain communities to extreme floods. We illustrate this argument with a case study of the Logone Floodplain, Cameroon. Based on hydrological data, ethnographic research and a series of focus group interviews with floodplain villagers, we analyze the interplay of top-down planning and adaptive self-organization in response to two extreme floods in 2012 and 2015. We show that recent top-down strategies of hydraulic control in the floodplain have led to more hydraulic uncertainty for local populations, and curtailed the conditions for sustainable self-organization in the floodplain.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500', 'afid': '60003500', 'affilname': 'The Ohio State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120280245', 'afid': '120280245', 'affilname': 'Association Camerounaise pour l’Education Environnementale (ACEEN)', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}]",Journal,Article,"['Laborde S.', 'Mahamat A.', 'Moritz M.']","['36342532800', '57190861752', '36054645200']",Central Africa | Ethnography | Floodplain | Planning | Self-organization,NSF,BCS-1211986,National Science Foundation,,1211986

Overlooking the contribution of inland fisheries to poverty prevention and alleviation may undermine the capacity to successfully meet the development goals, especially in rural communities in Low-Income Food-Deficit countries. Inland fisheries are essential for food and economic security as the vast majority are small-scale operations or subsistence, predominantly used by poorer groups. Protecting inland fisheries from diverse threats from other water users and associated sectors requires robust, multi-sectoral, and multinational policies that can be brought about by global initiatives like the SDGs. Without such protection, their vital contribution towards sustainable livelihoods and poverty issues becomes uncertain. Further, integrating inland fisheries into sustainable development frameworks strengthens the likelihood of achieving the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this perspective article, we posit that including inland fisheries in national policy statements and programs can prove beneficial to promoting economic and social growth for the poor, preventing further poverty, and achieving SDG 1 and other SDG targets, especially those related to food security.",31,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030469', 'afid': '60030469', 'affilname': 'University of Hull', 'affiliation-city': 'Hull', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017592', 'afid': '60017592', 'affilname': 'Carleton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ottawa', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007313', 'afid': '60007313', 'affilname': 'Illinois Natural History Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Champaign', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500', 'afid': '60003500', 'affilname': 'The Ohio State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119761595', 'afid': '119761595', 'affilname': 'Secure Fisheries', 'affiliation-city': 'Broomfield', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Short Survey,"['Lynch A.', 'Cowx I.', 'Fluet-Chouinard E.', 'Glaser S.', 'Phang S.', 'Beard T.', 'Bower S.', 'Brooks J.', 'Bunnell D.', 'Claussen J.', 'Cooke S.', 'Kao Y.', 'Lorenzen K.', 'Myers B.', 'Reid A.', 'Taylor J.', 'Youn S.']","['7102636889', '56284380100', '56140555200', '35966044500', '57190860880', '7102133180', '56218122500', '56026525800', '7004363969', '6603886251', '24320083600', '55655833700', '7004676985', '57190120576', '55589415600', '56073964300', '56457612900']",Inland fisheries | Livelihoods | Poverty | Sustainable Development Goals,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0959378017303965,1211986

African floodplains are an excellent example of coupled human–natural systems because they exhibit strong interactions among multiple social, ecological, and hydrological systems. The intra-annual and interannual variations in seasonal flooding have direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and human lives and livelihoods. Coupled human and natural system (CHANS) is a broad conceptual framework that is used to study systems in which human and natural components interact. While there are other conceptual frameworks to study social-ecological systems, the CHANS framework offers a clear way of studying the interactions, called couplings, between human and natural systems. Core features of the framework are the following: human and natural systems are analytically separated; focus is on processes within and couplings between systems; and the goal is to build an integrative, quantitative model of the coupled system. This paper explains the conceptual framework of coupled systems, using the case study of the Logone floodplain in Cameroon. We compare the CHANS framework with other frameworks that have been used to study the same floodplain, and argue for its usefulness in the study of African floodplains.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60120580', 'afid': '60120580', 'affilname': 'Université de Maroua', 'affiliation-city': 'Maroua', 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013997', 'afid': '60013997', 'affilname': 'Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500', 'afid': '60003500', 'affilname': 'The Ohio State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110297083', 'afid': '110297083', 'affilname': 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)', 'affiliation-city': 'Yaounde', 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109657583', 'afid': '109657583', 'affilname': ""Centre d'Appui a la Recherche et au Pastoralisme (CARPA)"", 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}]",Journal,Article,"['Moritz M.', 'Laborde S.', 'Phang S.', 'Ahmadou M.', 'Durand M.', 'Fernandez A.', 'Hamilton I.', 'Kari S.', 'Mark B.', 'Scholte P.', 'Xiao N.', 'Ziebe R.']","['36054645200', '36342532800', '57190860880', '57188559196', '56489758400', '7403494719', '7101859333', '14014550700', '7005209721', '7003277623', '7006517690', '57188565648']",adaptive cycle | conceptual frameworks | ecosystem services | institutional analysis | interdisciplinary research | resilience | social- ecological systems,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1211986

After the publication of this article, we discovered an error in the simulations utilized for the paper. Specifically, a typo in an input file meant that rainfall was not included into the model. Thus, the model simulations in the paper assume no rainfall. We apologize for this involuntary mistake. Nonetheless, after a careful consideration of the study domain and the available hydroclimatic and soil data in the study area, we have concluded that in fact it is reasonable to run the hydraulic model without including rainfall. Existing literature on the Logone Floodplain suggests that much of the early rainfall infiltrates into soils and evaporates quickly. Note that total rainfall over the floodplain is less than one meter per year, whereas annual PET has been estimated as high as three meters per year. Previous studies noted that the soils in the area are clays (this is consistent with the SoilGrids1km described in Hengl et al., 2014) and exhibit surface sealing, but also refer to large cracks in the clays, which would need to fill with water prior to sealing (Naah, 1990). Infiltration and subsequent evaporation from bare soils is not handled in the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model that we used. To the extent that this process is important, we would argue that it is better to simply leave precipitation out of the hydraulic simulations. Consistent with previous studies (e.g. Evans and Loth, 2004) we believe that the main function of rainfall over the floodplain is to allow saturation of the soil a few weeks before the overbank flow, thus facilitating, but not controlling, the water movement on the floodplain. Accounting for this effect in the LISFLOOD-FP model requires knowledge of infiltration rates at high spatial resolution, which is currently infeasible in this region of Cameroon. However, given the hydroclimatic and surface characteristics of the study area, we believe that neglecting the effect of rainfall, evaporation, and infiltration will not have a significant effect on the accuracy of simulated flooding dynamics at the spatial resolutions utilized in the paper. Therefore, the error in the simulation set-up does not affect the main conclusions of our work. The following sections of the paper are impacted by this corrigendum: 1. The inclusion of TRMM time series as input into the model as described in the methods section. The model did not include rainfall.2. The interpretation of the figure describing the mass balance of the floodplain (Fig. 6 in the original paper). Precipitation and evaporation data utilized in this figure were taken from a model output representing P-E. The correct interpretation is that precipitation does not compensate evaporation, thereby making the overbank flow the principal factor controlling flooding dynamics (consistent with Evans and Loth, 2004). See Fig. 1, below.3. All the sentences in section 4.3 that show a detailed analysis of TRMM data to explain spatial discrepancies between model output and Landsat-derived flooding maps.4.

African floodplains are an excellent example of coupled human–natural systems because they exhibit strong interactions among multiple social, ecological, and hydrological systems. The intra-annual and interannual variations in seasonal flooding have direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and human lives and livelihoods. Coupled human and natural system (CHANS) is a broad conceptual framework that is used to study systems in which human and natural components interact. While there are other conceptual frameworks to study social-ecological systems, the CHANS framework offers a clear way of studying the interactions, called couplings, between human and natural systems. Core features of the framework are the following: human and natural systems are analytically separated; focus is on processes within and couplings between systems; and the goal is to build an integrative, quantitative model of the coupled system. This paper explains the conceptual framework of coupled systems, using the case study of the Logone floodplain in Cameroon. We compare the CHANS framework with other frameworks that have been used to study the same floodplain, and argue for its usefulness in the study of African floodplains.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60120580', 'afid': '60120580', 'affilname': 'Université de Maroua', 'affiliation-city': 'Maroua', 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013997', 'afid': '60013997', 'affilname': 'Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500', 'afid': '60003500', 'affilname': 'The Ohio State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbus', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110297083', 'afid': '110297083', 'affilname': 'Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)', 'affiliation-city': 'Yaounde', 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109657583', 'afid': '109657583', 'affilname': ""Centre d'Appui a la Recherche et au Pastoralisme (CARPA)"", 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Cameroon'}]",Journal,Article,"['Moritz M.', 'Laborde S.', 'Phang S.', 'Ahmadou M.', 'Durand M.', 'Fernandez A.', 'Hamilton I.', 'Kari S.', 'Mark B.', 'Scholte P.', 'Xiao N.', 'Ziebe R.']","['36054645200', '36342532800', '57190860880', '57188559196', '56489758400', '7403494719', '7101859333', '14014550700', '7005209721', '7003277623', '7006517690', '57188565648']",adaptive cycle | conceptual frameworks | ecosystem services | institutional analysis | interdisciplinary research | resilience | social- ecological systems,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1211986

Recent research efforts sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and others found that Florida red tide causes both acute and possibly chronic health effects from the toxic aerosols. Florida red tide also demonstrated significant social and economic impacts to both coastal residents and visitors. In conjunction with the research, persistent outreach efforts were conducted over the 11-year period. The goal of this project was to assess potential needs for tailored messaging needed among different red tide information user groups. Survey participants included 303 local residents, both with asthma and without, and 'snowbirds (seasonal residents that reside in the Sarasota area for more than 3 months but less than 6 months/year), also both with asthma and without. The questionnaire assessed Florida red tide knowledge and risk perception regarding Florida red tide using items drawn from two previously published surveys to allow comparison. Our results reveal that overall knowledge of Florida red tide has not changed. We found that knowledge was consistent across our selected groups and also did not vary by age, gender and education level. However, knowledge regarding consumption of seafood during Florida red tide has declined. Risk perception increased significantly for people who have asthma.

K. brevis requires macro-nutrients to grow; although the sources of these nutrients have not been resolved completely, they are thought to originate both naturally and anthropogenically. The latter sources comprise atmospheric depositions, industrial effluents, land runoffs, or submerged groundwater discharges. To date, there has been only limited research on the extent of human health risks and economic impacts due to FRT. We hypothesized that FRT blooms were associated with increases in the numbers of emergency room visits and hospital inpatient admissions for both respiratory and digestive illnesses. We sought to estimate these relationships and to calculate the costs of associated adverse health impacts. We developed environmental exposure-response models to test the effects of FRT blooms on human health, using data from diverse sources. We estimated the FRT bloom-associated illness costs, using extant data and parameters from the literature. When controlling for resident population, a proxy for tourism, and seasonal and annual effects, we found that increases in respiratory and digestive illnesses can be explained by FRT blooms. Specifically, FRT blooms were associated with human health and economic effects in older cohorts (≥. 55. years of age) in six southwest Florida counties. Annual costs of illness ranged from $60,000 to $700,000 annually, but these costs could exceed $1.0. million per year for severe, long-lasting FRT blooms, such as the one that occurred during 2005. Assuming that the average annual illness costs of FRT blooms persist into the future, using a discount rate of 3%, the capitalized costs of future illnesses would range between $2 and 24. million.© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60111707', 'afid': '60111707', 'affilname': 'University of Exeter Medical School', 'affiliation-city': 'Exeter', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029251', 'afid': '60029251', 'affilname': 'University of Miami', 'affiliation-city': 'Coral Gables', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021519', 'afid': '60021519', 'affilname': 'University of Miami Leonard M.

Failing to account for these dynamic links results in intertemporal and spatial externalities, reaping benefits in the present but imposing costs on future and distant people, such as occurs with overgrazing. Recent findings about locust-nutrient dynamics create new opportunities to address spatiodynamic ecosystem externalities and develop new sustainable strategies to understand and manage locust outbreaks. These findings in northeast China demonstrate that excessive livestock grazing promotes locust outbreaks in an unexpected way: by lowering plant nitrogen content due to soil degradation. We use these human-locust-livestock-nutrient interactions in grasslands to illustrate CHANS concepts.

Context: Grasshoppers are a dominant herbivore assemblage globally and play an important role for ecosystem nutrient cycling. Yet, we lack a strong understanding of the relationship between grasshopper diversity and plant community composition at the landscape scale. Objective: Our aim was to test landscape scale relationships between plant and grasshopper communities. Methods: We used a large-scale, replicated experiment at four sites, including grazed and protected pastures across a 350 km transect and 200–400 mm precipitation gradient in the steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed the relationships between plant and grasshopper parameters with ANOVAs and CCA. Results: We collected 17 grasshopper species and 15,000+ individuals. The desert steppe (lowest precipitation) had the lowest grasshopper richness and diversity, but abundance was not different from the other sites. In two dry sites (desert steppe and Stipa steppe), livestock grazing decreased grasshopper diversity and increased abundance of the main pest species. In contrast, at the highest precipitation site (meadow steppe), grasshopper communities did not differ between grazing levels. Across all sites and grazing intensities, grasshopper abundance tended to be lowest and diversity highest in plant communities with intermediate levels of biomass and plant species richness. Conclusion: These results support the concept that appropriate land use management practices would be beneficial for increasing biodiversity, promoting grassland sustainability, and reducing outbreaks of the dominant pest grasshopper in Inner Mongolia.

Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Comparisons of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (P) content of plants and insect herbivores suggests that P limitation and herbivore foraging to balance P intake could be common. However, the lack of synthetic diets for testing the effects of lower ranges of dietary P has been a major impediment to experimental assessment of the ecological importance of, and physiological responses to, P limitation for terrestrial herbivores. We manipulated dietary P content (%P) over its observed range in terrestrial foliage using artificial diets containing near-optimal content of other nutrients for the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. Over much of the ecologically relevant range, when consuming single diets over a lifetime, higher P stimulated growth rates and increased survival, with an optimal dietary %P of 0.25-0.50% when measured throughout development. Excessive dietary P (1%) reduced growth and survival. However, with only short-term (3 day) confinement to single diets, dietary P had no effect on food consumption or growth rates. During these short exposures, fifth (but not third) instar hoppers increased the proportion of P excreted relative to P assimilated as dietary P increased. Target experiments demonstrated that, when given a choice, grasshoppers select among foods to attain a P intake target of 0.6%. These data suggest that P limitation could be common for terrestrial insect herbivores and that they can exhibit ingestive and post-ingestive mechanisms to attain sufficient but not excessive P.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100350453', 'afid': '100350453', 'affilname': 'Orange Coast College', 'affiliation-city': 'Costa Mesa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Cease A.', 'Fay M.', 'Elser J.', 'Harrison J.']","['15122039600', '7102585653', '7006151096', '7402743187']",Diet choice | Ecological stoichiometry | Geometric framework | Grasshopper | Phosphate | Synthetic diet,NSF,IBN-9977047,National Science Foundation,,1313693

For many species, migration evolves to allow organisms to access better resources. However, the proximate factors that trigger these developmental changes, and how and why these vary across species, remain poorly understood. One prominent hypothesis is that poor-quality food promotes development of migratory phenotypes and this has been clearly shown for some polyphenic insects. In other animals, particularly long-distance bird migrants, it is clear that high-quality food is required to prepare animals for a successful migration. We tested the effect of diet quality on the flight behaviour and morphology of the Mongolian locust, Oedaleus asiaticus. Locusts reared at high population density and fed low-N grass (performance-enhancing for this species) had enhanced migratory morphology relative to locusts fed high-N grass. Furthermore, locusts fed synthetic diets with an optimal 1: 2 protein: carbohydrate ratio flew for longer times than locusts fed diets with lower or higher protein: carbohydrate ratios.

Thresholds and tipping points that are characteristic of dynamic multi-stability are increasingly prominent touchstones of the science-policy interface. Prior economic work has shown thresholds arising in convex-concave ecological models that exclude humans may disappear in models of coupled economic-ecological systems when economic agents are included as part of the system. Less well-understood is how this result may depend on the ability of humans to manage complex systems. We examine the role of institutions that condition the available management choices. We find institutional restrictions do not generate non-convexities when the ecological system is well-behaved, but that these restrictions may generate non-convexities when the ecological system is convex-concave. These results are tied to the concept of path controllability, which is when managers have sufficient controls to guide the system across the state space. Path controllability is the dynamic version of the Tinbergen rule, and generally requires separate controls to manage each possible ecological externality. We link the concepts of ecosystem externalities, thresholds, and path controllability to provide new economic insights into problems with the potential for multi-stability, and we illustrate the importance of institutions for managing convex-concave systems.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fenichel E.', 'Horan R.']","['9335127600', '7006830589']",Decouplability | Ecological-economic model | Institutions | Optimal control | Path controllability | Polycentric governance | Skiba point | Socio-ecological system (SES) | Sufficiency conditions,NIFA,2011-67023-30872,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167268116301226,1313693

We worked in two rural farming villages in the Kaffrine region of Senegal. Oedaleus senegalensis was least abundant in groundnut areas where plant N was highest and abundance was negatively correlated with plant N across land use types. Overall, grasshoppers were most numerous in grazing and fallow areas. There was little variation in soil properties across land use types and soil organic matter (SOM) and inorganic soil N content were low throughout. SOM was positively correlated with soil inorganic N concentration, which in turn was positively correlated with plant N content. Of the management practices we surveyed, fallowing fields was important for soil N and SOM replenishment.

It offers a straightforward factor-income approach to calculating payments for ecosystem services (PES) to livestock producers who reduce or suspend grazing for the purpose of grassland restoration. Our approach requires only cross-sectional farm-level accounting data and is thus feasible where policies have either not yet been applied or specialized data is sparse, as is common in many developing regions. We apply and validate this approach with empirical analysis of sheep and goat herders in the Ulanqab prefecture in Inner Mongolia, China where herders currently receive payments in exchange for reduced grazing intensity on vulnerable land. However, observed stocking rates are still commonly higher than recommended. Our results suggest payments are currently insufficient to offset the financial loss incurred by herders who reduce their grazing intensity, a finding consistent with previous studies. Using an approach we refer to as the factor-income method, we estimate and validate new levels of recommended payments. This demonstrates how future payments could be tailored to meet the financial needs of individual herding communities using basic farm-level data.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028205', 'afid': '60028205', 'affilname': 'Neimenggu Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Hohhot', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Byrne A.T.', 'Hadrich J.C.', 'Robinson B.E.', 'Han G.']","['57212215147', '35621988900', '56670451000', '27172263600']",Government subsidy | Grassland policy | Inner Mongolia | Livestock production | Payment for ecosystem services,ACIAR,ADP/2012/107,Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837719301449,1313693

However, several studies have shown that land management practices like grazing heavily influences locust-human linkages. In this review we synthesize published research and reports on connections between locust outbreaks and ranching. For this, we conducted an extensive literature search using Google Scholar on the 19 species of grasshoppers that are currently considered to be locusts or non-model locusts. Species were sorted according to their feeding guilds: (1) forb- and/or tree-feeding locusts; (2) mix-feeding locusts (grasses, forbs, and/or trees); (3) grass-feeding locusts. We review their pest status, ecology, and relationship with grazing. We then discuss the overall data and draw general patterns on how locusts and locust control affect livestock grazing through various mechanisms (competition, nutritional preferences, pesticide use, nutrient cycling). We draw attention to “telecoupling” a process in which land management practices like grazing have ecological feedbacks on locust populations, which in turn affects food security in distant regions due to the migratory capacity of locusts.

Climate change is impacting agro-ecosystems, crops, and farmer livelihoods in communities worldwide. While it is well understood that more frequent and intense climate events in many areas are resulting in a decline in crop yields, the impact on crop quality is less acknowledged, yet it is critical for food systems that benefit both farmers and consumers through high-quality products. This study examines tea (Camellia sinensis; Theaceae), the world's most widely consumed beverage after water, as a study system to measure effects of seasonal precipitation variability on crop functional quality and associated farmer knowledge, preferences, and livelihoods. Sampling was conducted in a major tea producing area of China during an extreme drought through the onset of the East Asian Monsoon in order to capture effects of extreme climate events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change. Compared to the spring drought, tea growth during the monsoon period was up to 50% higher. Concurrently, concentrations of catechin and methylxanthine secondary metabolites, major compounds that determine tea functional quality, were up to 50% lower during the monsoon while total phenolic concentrations and antioxidant activity increased. The inverse relationship between tea growth and concentrations of individual secondary metabolites suggests a dilution effect of precipitation on tea quality. The decrease in concentrations of tea secondary metabolites was accompanied by reduced farmer preference on the basis of sensory characteristics as well as a decline of up to 50% in household income from tea sales. Farmer surveys indicate a high degree of agreement regarding climate patterns and the effects of precipitation on tea yields and quality. Extrapolating findings from this seasonal study to long-term climate scenario projections suggests that farmers and consumers face variable implications with forecasted precipitation scenarios and calls for research on management practices to facilitate climate adaptation for sustainable crop production.",58,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032275', 'afid': '60032275', 'affilname': 'Minzu University of China', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023143', 'afid': '60023143', 'affilname': 'Tufts University', 'affiliation-city': 'Medford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007033', 'afid': '60007033', 'affilname': 'City University of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101724372', 'afid': '101724372', 'affilname': 'University of Gainesville', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ahmed S.', 'Stepp J.R.', 'Orians C.', 'Griffin T.', 'Matyas C.', 'Robbat A.', 'Cash S.', 'Xue D.', 'Long C.', 'Unachukwu U.', 'Buckley S.', 'Small D.', 'Kennelly E.']","['55456818200', '7004256528', '7003982020', '57203071861', '16242031400', '7003716267', '8308208000', '55461823800', '55649597000', '36464335600', '56189205500', '36947163700', '7004641877']",,,undefined,,,1313775

This paper highlights the need for climate studies on specialty crops to focus not only on yields, but also on quality, as well as the ability of agroecological management to buffer climate effects on quality parameters. Crop quality refers to phytonutrient and secondary metabolite profiles and associated health and sensory properties that influence consumer buying decisions. Through two literature reviews, we provide examples of specialty crops that are vulnerable to climate effects on quality and examples of climate-resilient agroecological strategies. A range of specialty crops including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, stimulants, and herbs were identified to respond to climate variables with changes in quality. The review on climate-resilient strategies to mitigate effects on crop quality highlighted a major gap in the literature. However, agricultural diversification emerged as a promising strategy for climate resilience more broadly and highlights the need for future research to assess the potential of diversified agroecosystems to buffer climate effects on crop quality. We integrate the concepts from our literature review within a socio-ecological systems framework that takes into account feedbacks between crop quality, consumer responses, and agroecosystem management. The presented framework is especially useful for two themes in agricultural development and marketing, nutrition-sensitive agriculture and terroir, for informing the design of climate-change resilient specialty crop systems focused on management of quality and other ecosystem services towards promoting environmental and human wellbeing.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ahmed S.', 'Stepp J.']","['55456818200', '7004256528']",,CSC,P20GM103474,China Scholarship Council,,1313775

Undergraduate courses provide valuable opportunities to train and empower students with the knowledge, skills, and motivation to advance society in more sustainable directions. This article emphasizes the value of bridging primary scientific research with undergraduate education through the presentation of an integrated experiential learning and primary research model called Farm-based Authentic Research Modules in Sustainability Sciences (FARMS). FARMS are collaboratively designed with agricultural stakeholders through a community needs assessment on pressing food system issues and opportunities with the objective for faculty and students to jointly identify evidence-based management solutions. We illustrate the implementation of FARMS in an undergraduate course in Ecological Agriculture at Dartmouth College, NH where students assessed various agroecological solutions for managing plant vitality, weeds, soil quality, pests, pollinators, and biodiversity at the Dartmouth Organic Farm. Student reflections indicate that the FARMS course component was beneficial for understanding agroecological theories and concepts while also motivating involvement in sustainability sciences despite the challenges of primary research. Educator reflections noted that the FARMS pedagogical approach facilitated achieving course objectives to develop students’ ability for systems thinking, critical thinking, and interdisciplinarity while fostering students’ collaboration skills and overall motivation for creating change. Adopting the FARMS model should enable faculty in the sustainability sciences to serve as bridges between the learning, practicing, and scientific communities while supporting educational programming at student and community farms. Ultimately, it is expected that the implementation of FARMS will increase student capacity and prepare the next generation of leaders to address complex challenges of the food system using an evidence-based approach.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010756', 'afid': '60010756', 'affilname': 'Dartmouth College', 'affiliation-city': 'Hanover', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ahmed S.', 'Sclafani A.', 'Aquino E.', 'Kala S.', 'Barias L.', 'Eeg J.']","['55456818200', '57205553849', '57205563405', '57202853230', '57205564613', '57205560504']",Agroecology | Experiential learning | Scholarship of teaching | Student farms | Sustainable food systems | Undergraduate primary research,NSF,5P20GM103474-17,National Science Foundation,,1313775

Organic tea production has increased in China over the past decade because of the perceived higher quality of the tea as well as the benefits for environmental and human wellbeing. The present study compared the functional quality components of tea harvested from organic and conventional management systems in adjacent fields within the same farms at six sites in eastern China. Findings demonstrated that water extracts of organic tea had significantly higher concentrations of key catechins linked to tea quality, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epicatechin (EC), compared to that of conventional tea. Concentrations of proline and γ-aminobutyric acid were also statistically higher in organic tea from some sites. However, most of free amino acids, particularly theanine, were lower in organic tea. The findings indicated that the tea in organic systems were under greater environmental stress than the tea in the conventional system, as accumulation of catechins and proline in plants is associated with environmental stress. The lower concentrations of amino acids in organic tea indicated potential nitrogen deficiencies and the need for managing soil nitrogen to increase overall amino acid levels while still managing for high levels of polyphenols. The higher concentrations of antioxidant compounds in organic tea suggested potentially greater health benefits, as these compounds are linked to disease mitigation and health promotion in human consumers. Overall, this study showed improved quality characteristics of organically produced tea whilst also highlighting agro-ecosystem techniques to further enhance the functional quality characteristics of organic tea on the basis of amino acid profiles.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073471', 'afid': '60073471', 'affilname': ""Ministry of Health of People's Republic of China"", 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han W.', 'Wang D.', 'Fu S.', 'Ahmed S.']","['9238329700', '57196349384', '57196330692', '55456818200']",agro-ecosystems | health benefits | Organic tea | polyphenolic catechins | proline,CAAS,CNH BCS-1313775,Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,,1313775

Plants produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with diverse structures and functions, which change in response to environmental stimuli and have important consequences for interactions with other organisms. To understand these changes, in situ sampling is necessary. In contrast to dynamic headspace (DHS), which is the most often employed method, direct contact sampling employing a magnetic stir bar held in place by a magnet eliminates artifacts produced by enclosing plant materials in glass or plastic chambers. Direct-contact sorptive extraction (DCSE) using polydimethylsiloxane coated stir bars (Twisters) coated stir bars is more sensitive than DHS, captures a wider range of compounds, minimizes VOC collection from neighboring plants, and distinguishes the effects of herbivory in controlled and field conditions. Because DCSE is relatively inexpensive and simple to employ, scalability of field trials can be expanded concomitant with increased sample replication. The sensitivity of DCSE combined with the spectral deconvolution data analysis software makes the two ideal for comprehensive, in situ profiling of plant volatiles.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023143', 'afid': '60023143', 'affilname': 'Tufts University', 'affiliation-city': 'Medford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kfoury N.', 'Scott E.', 'Orians C.', 'Robbat A.']","['55260313700', '16437294400', '7003982020', '7003716267']",direct contact sorptive extraction (DCSE) | GC/MS | in situ sampling | metabolomics | plant VOCs,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1313775

Climate change is impacting food and beverage crops around the world with implications for environmental and human well-being. While numerous studies have examined climate change effects on crop yields, relatively few studies have examined effects on crop quality (concentrations of nutrients, minerals, and secondary metabolites). This review article employs a culturally relevant beverage crop, tea (Camelia sinensis), as a lens to examine environmental effects linked to climate change on the directionality of crop quality. Our systematic review identified 86 articles as relevant to the review question. Findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies likely due to confounding factors including variation in tea variety, cultivar, specific environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in research methods. The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress with 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrating a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or first tea harvest to other seasons and seven out of 10 studies (70%) showing an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence on tea quality. Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. The development of evidence-based management strategies and crop breeding programs for resilient cultivars are called for to mitigate climate impacts on crop quality and overall risk in agricultural and food systems.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032275', 'afid': '60032275', 'affilname': 'Minzu University of China', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023143', 'afid': '60023143', 'affilname': 'Tufts University', 'affiliation-city': 'Medford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ahmed S.', 'Griffin T.', 'Kraner D.', 'Schaffner M.', 'Sharma D.', 'Hazel M.', 'Leitch A.', 'Orians C.', 'Han W.', 'Stepp J.', 'Robbat A.', 'Matyas C.', 'Long C.', 'Xue D.', 'Houser R.', 'Cash S.']","['55456818200', '57203071861', '57211147522', '57211147791', '57211144945', '57204046602', '57203201336', '7003982020', '9238329700', '7004256528', '7003716267', '16242031400', '55649597000', '55461823800', '35329897700', '8308208000']",agriculture | climate change | crop quality | food systems | secondary metabolites,NIGMS,NSF RII Track-2 FEC 1632810,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,,1313775

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of their purchases. Prior research has assessed willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental and ethical attributes on foods and beverages such as locally grown, fairly traded, and organically produced. However, few studies have examined WTP for agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, especially in the U.S. and to date, no prior study has examined how knowledge or concerns about climate change motivate WTP for climate-friendly products. The objective of this study was to estimate WTP for agricultural GHG mitigation and examine variability in WTP across consumer characteristics, climate change knowledge and risk perception. A sensory-grounded choice experiment and survey assessing climate change knowledge and risk perception was administrated to specialty food and beverage shoppers in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. Male and lower-income participants, as well as those at the Midwestern study site were willing to pay a higher premium for agricultural GHG mitigation, relative to females, higher income participants, and those in the Northeastern U.S. Knowledge of climate change and level of concerns for the risks it poses were not significantly associated with increased WTP for agricultural GHG mitigation.

Plants often experience multiple sources of stress simultaneously, yet little is known about interactive effects of multiple stressors on plant metabolic responses. Plants are well known to respond to both drought and insect herbivory through the induced production of secondary metabolites. However, severe drought stress limits photosynthesis and may therefore inhibit the production of induced secondary metabolites in response to herbivory due to carbon limitation. On the other hand, drought-stressed plants may be primed to respond more strongly to herbivory due to hormonal crosstalk or redundancy of metabolites that are produced in response to drought and herbivory. We tested the interactive effects of drought and simulated herbivory in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze var. sinensis) grown in the field under varying rainfall interception treatments and then exposed to an exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. We show that severe drought generally inhibits the induction of secondary metabolites by exogenous MeJA (simulated herbivory). However, a few volatile metabolites, including methyl salicylate, are more strongly induced by MeJA in severely drought-stressed plants compared to moderately stressed plants, possibly due to priming by drought stress. Our approach of using multiple levels of drought stress and a targeted/untargeted approach to measuring volatile metabolites was essential to discovering these patterns of induction. In addition to having implications for plant-herbivore interactions in the presence of abiotic stress, these results have important implications for tea quality.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023143', 'afid': '60023143', 'affilname': 'Tufts University', 'affiliation-city': 'Medford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022522', 'afid': '60022522', 'affilname': 'Montana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bozeman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Scott E.', 'Li X.', 'Kfoury N.', 'Morimoto J.', 'Han W.', 'Ahmed S.', 'Cash S.', 'Griffin T.', 'Stepp J.', 'Robbat A.', 'Orians C.']","['16437294400', '43361426200', '55260313700', '57202075156', '9238329700', '55456818200', '8308208000', '57203071861', '7004256528', '7003716267', '7003982020']",Drought stress | Methyl jasmonate | Multiple stressors | Plant volatiles | Plant-Insect interactions | Tea (Camellia sinensis),USDA,BCS-1313775,U.S. Department of Agriculture,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S009884721831030X,1313775

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of non-genetically modified (non-GM) crops are not clear, although they may have significant environmental and agronomic impacts and important policy implications. To understand the dynamics of non-GM crops and to inform the debates among relevant stakeholders, we conducted spatiotemporal analyses of China's major non-GM soybean production region, the Heilongjiang Province. Even though the total soybean planting area decreased from 2005 to 2010, surprisingly, there were hotspots of increase. The results also showed hotspots of loss as well as a large decline in the number and continuity of soybean plots.

Various meta-studies have been conducted, which synthesize deforestation and agricultural land use change processes, while other important changes, such as urbanization, wetland conversion, and grassland dynamics have hardly been addressed. Meta-studies of land use change impacts focus mostly on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, while meta-studies of socioeconomic consequences are rare. Land use change processes and land use change impacts are generally addressed in isolation, while only few studies considered trajectories of drivers through changes to their impacts and their potential feedbacks. We provide a conceptual framework for linking meta-studies of land use change processes and impacts for the analysis of coupled human–environmental systems. Moreover, we provide suggestions for combining meta-studies of different land use change processes to develop a more integrated theory of land use change, and for combining meta-studies of land use change impacts to identify tradeoffs between different impacts.

All rights reserved. With the rapid decline in biodiversity worldwide it is imperative to develop procedures for assessing changes in biodiversity across space. The synoptic view provided by imaging remote sensors constitutes a suitable approach for analyzing biodiversity from local to regional scales. A procedure based on the close relationship between floristic similarity and the similarity in land surface phenology was recently developed and successfully applied to assess diversity patterns using time series imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). However, as it depends on high temporal resolution remotely sensed data (e.g., MODIS), the procedure is constrained by the coarse spatial resolution characterizing these high temporal resolution data. Using an optimized technique for image fusion, we combined high temporal resolution data acquired by the MODIS sensor system with moderate spatial resolution data acquired by the Landsat TM/ETM+ sensor systems. Our results show that the MODIS/Landsat data fusion allows the characterization of land surface phenology at higher spatial resolutions, which better corresponded with information acquired within vegetation survey plots established in temperate montane forests located in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. As such, the procedure is useful for capturing changes in biodiversity induced by disturbances operating at large spatial scales and constitutes a suitable tool for monitoring and managing biodiversity.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100351942', 'afid': '100351942', 'affilname': 'China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Viña A.', 'Liu W.', 'Zhou S.', 'Huang J.', 'Liu J.']","['7003596463', '56436984700', '12781668300', '55881736700', '35491043300']",Biodiversity | Floristic similarity | Image fusion | Landsat | MODIS | Phenologic similarity | Spectral vegetation indices | Visible atmospherically resistant index,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1470160X1600011X,1518518

The global food market makes international players intrinsically connected through the flow of commodities, demand, production, and consumption. Local decisions, such as new economic policies or dietary shifts, can foster changes in coupled human-natural systems across long distances. Understanding the causes and effects of these changes is essential for agricultural-export countries, such as Brazil. Since 2000, Brazil has led the expansion of soybean planted area-19 million hectares, or 47.5% of the world's increase. Soybean is among the major crop commodities traded globally. We use the telecoupling framework to analyze (i) the international trade dynamics between Brazil and China as the cause of the increased production of Brazilian soybean since 2000; (ii) and the cascading effects of the Sino-Brazilian telecoupled soybean system for Brazilian maize production and exports, with attention to consequences on domestic prices, availability, and risks associated with climatic extreme events. Census-based data at state and county levels, policy analysis, and interviews with producers and stakeholders guided our methodological approach. We identified that the Brazilian soybean production decreased maize single crop production and accelerated maize as a second crop following soybean, a practice that makes farmers more vulnerable to precipitation anomalies (e.g., rainfall shortage). In addition, the two-crop system of soybean/maize pressures the Brazilian maize market when unexpected events such as extreme droughts strike and when this results in a failed maize harvest in the second crop, most of which is for domestic consumption rather than export. Our study suggests the need to incorporate the telecoupling framework in land use decision-making and understanding landscape changes.",27,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009625', 'afid': '60009625', 'affilname': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa', 'affiliation-city': 'Brasilia', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['da Silva R.', 'Batistella M.', 'Dou Y.', 'Moran E.', 'Torres S.', 'Liu J.']","['49862903000', '6508328264', '57104527800', '7202641088', '57194467024', '35491043300']",Global trade | Maize | Soybean | Telecoupling,NSF,1518518,National Science Foundation,,1518518

Energy systems, which include energy production, conversion, transportation, distribution and utilization, are key infrastructures in modern society. Interactions among energy systems are generally studied under the framework of energy trade. Although such studies have generated important insights, there are limitations. Many distant interactions (e.g. those due to the Fukushima nuclear crisis) are not in the form of trade, but affect energy sustainability. Even when distant interactions are related to energy trade, they are not systematically analyzed. Environmental impacts of trade are often not integrated with economic analysis of trade. In this paper, to identify and fill important knowledge gaps, we apply an integrated framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances). The framework of telecoupling, which is more comprehensive and cross-disciplinary than the energy trade framework, is a useful theoretical and methodological tool for analyzing distant interactions among coupled human and natural systems (including energy systems). Telecouplings widely exist in energy systems with various forms and link energy sustainability of different countries closely, so we proposed some methods for energy sustainability analysis under the framework of telecoupling. From the aspect of causes, a method is proposed to judge whether the telecoupling driven by economic factors is conducive to energy sustainability. From the aspect of effects, a method is proposed to assess whether an event is conducive to energy sustainability. The telecoupling framework presents opportunities for more profound and comprehensive understanding of energy sustainability.",27,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356', 'afid': '60032356', 'affilname': 'Hunan University', 'affiliation-city': 'Changsha', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015815', 'afid': '60015815', 'affilname': 'Universität Stuttgart', 'affiliation-city': 'Stuttgart', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fang B.', 'Tan Y.', 'Li C.', 'Cao Y.', 'Liu J.', 'Schweizer P.J.', 'Shi H.', 'Zhou B.', 'Chen H.', 'Hu Z.']","['56027484300', '36818188800', '24341224300', '7404523611', '35491043300', '26654459300', '56028379200', '56905089300', '57188828991', '57216088980']",Climate change | Energy market | Energy sustainability | Environmental sustainability | Telecoupling,,2013GK4089,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0360544216302997,1518518

Migratory species are an important component of biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services for humans, but many are threatened and endangered. Numerous studies have been conducted on the biology of migratory species, and there is an increased recognition of the major role of human dimensions in conserving migratory species. However, there is a lack of systematic integration of socioeconomic and environmental factors. Because human activities affect migratory species in multiple places, integrating socioeconomic and environmental factors across space is essential, but challenging. The holistic framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) has the potential to help meet this challenge because it enables researchers to integrate human and natural interactions across multiple distant places. The use of the telecoupling framework may also lead to new conservation strategies and actions. To demonstrate its potential, we apply the framework to Kirtland's warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii), a conservation-reliant migratory songbird. Results show accomplishments from long-term research and recovery efforts on the warbler in the context of the telecoupling framework. The results also show 24 research gaps even though the species has been relatively well-studied compared to many other species. An important gap is a lack of systematic studies on feedbacks among breeding, wintering, and stopover sites, as well as other ""spillover"" systems that may affect and be affected by migration (e.g., via tourism, land use, or climate change). The framework integrated scattered information and provided useful insights about new research topics and flow-centered management approaches that encapsulate the full annual cycle of migration. We also illustrate the similarities and differences between Kirtland's warblers and several other migratory species, indicating the applicability of the telecoupling framework to understanding and managing common complexities associated with migratory species in a globalizing world.",27,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122465', 'afid': '60122465', 'affilname': 'California University of Pennsylvania', 'affiliation-city': 'California', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117779', 'afid': '60117779', 'affilname': 'College of Environmental and Resource Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Hangzhou', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hulina J.', 'Bocetti C.', 'Campa H.', 'Hull V.', 'Yang W.', 'Liu J.']","['57194563112', '6507398409', '6602486231', '24472727900', '55498812300', '35491043300']",Conservation | Coupled human and natural system | Full annual cycle | Governance | Management | Salmon | Sea turtle | Telecoupling | Warbler wildebeest,NIFA,undefined,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1518518

Researchers have studied agricultural land-use changes and related environmental issues across multi-trading countries together, but most studies rely on statistic data without spatial attributes. However, agricultural land-use changes are spatially heterogeneous. Uncovering spatial attributes can reveal more critical information that is of scientific significance and has policy implications for enhancing food security and protecting the environment. Based on an integrated framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances), we studied spatial attributes of soybean land changes within and among trading countries at the same time. Three distant countries – Brazil, China, and the United States – constitute an excellent example of telecoupled systems through the process of soybean trade. Our results presented the spatial distribution of soybean land changes – highlighting the hotspots of soybean gain and soybean loss, and indicated these changes were spatially clustered, different across multi-spatial scales, and varied among the trading countries. Assisted by the results, global challenges like food security and biodiversity loss within and among trading countries can be targeted and managed efficiently.

China currently has the largest population in the world and is currently experiencing rapid economic and urban growth, becoming the world's number one pork and poultry consumer. In order to meet this growing demand for meat, China has increased its demand for soybeans to produce chicken and pork. It has imported soybeans from the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, while keeping its soybean production for direct human consumption stable at home. Brazil has become the largest soybean exporter to China, and, in response specifically to Chinese demand, has become the second largest producer of soybeans in the world. This has changed land use in Brazil, particularly in its central plateau. In this paper, we indicate how these two countries, telecoupled by trade in soybeans, are depending on each other as they try to balance environmental and economic objectives. Brazil, as a sending system, has created pressures on its natural ecosystems, which have led to losses particularly in the Cerrado biome and its ecotones in the Amazon's tropical moist forest biome. China, as a receiving system, has created a land asset important to regenerating its lost natural systems (e.g., forest cover areas). Both countries have different property rights regimes, which have created distinct circumstances in which they are to protect or regenerate their natural ecosystems. Throughout this paper, we analyze how both countries have dealt with the lure offered by the soybean commodity trade.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Torres S.', 'Moran E.', 'da Silva R.']","['57194467024', '7202641088', '49862903000']",Agribusiness | Brazil | China | Property rights | Telecoupling,FAPESP,2015/25892-7,FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo,,1518518

Urban areas such as megacities (those with populations greater than 10 million) are hotspots of global water use and thus face intense water management challenges. Urban areas are influenced by local interactions between human and natural systems and interact with distant systems through flows of water, food, energy, people, information, and capital. However, analyses of water sustainability and the management of water flows in urban areas are often fragmented. There is a strong need to apply integrated frameworks to systematically analyze urban water dynamics and factors that influence these dynamics. We apply the framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) to analyze urban water issues, using Beijing as a demonstration megacity. Beijing exemplifies the global water sustainability challenge for urban settings. Like many other cities, Beijing has experienced drastic reductions in quantity and quality of both surface water and groundwater over the past several decades; it relies on the import of real and virtual water from sending systems to meet its demand for clean water, and releases polluted water to other systems (spillover systems). The integrative framework we present demonstrates the importance of considering socioeconomic and environmental interactions across telecoupled human and natural systems, which include not only Beijing (the water-receiving system) but also water-sending systems and spillover systems. This framework helps integrate important components of local and distant human–nature interactions and incorporates a wide range of local couplings and telecouplings that affect water dynamics, which in turn generate significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, including feedback effects. The application of the framework to Beijing reveals many research gaps and management needs. We also provide a foundation to apply the telecoupling framework to better understand and manage water sustainability in other cities around the world.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105683', 'afid': '60105683', 'affilname': 'Southern University of Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Shenzhen', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014966', 'afid': '60014966', 'affilname': 'Peking University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551', 'afid': '60013551', 'affilname': 'China Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003970', 'afid': '60003970', 'affilname': 'Zhejiang University', 'affiliation-city': 'Hangzhou', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114850409', 'afid': '114850409', 'affilname': 'Beijing Water Science and Technology Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109491169', 'afid': '109491169', 'affilname': 'University of Alabama', 'affiliation-city': 'Montgomery', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yang W.', 'Hyndman D.W.', 'Winkler J.A.', 'Viña A.', 'Deines J.M.', 'Lupi F.', 'Luo L.', 'Li Y.', 'Basso B.', 'Zheng C.', 'Ma D.', 'Li S.', 'Liu X.', 'Zheng H.', 'Cao G.', 'Meng Q.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'Liu J.']","['55498812300', '7005335914', '7202100741', '7003596463', '54782254200', '6701734845', '7402314813', '8940214300', '15764844100', '7401934994', '55618146300', '37860915000', '56984737900', '8253975000', '36514421600', '57216401569', '7006468812', '35491043300']",Environmental governance | Megacity | Spillover effects | Sustainability | Systems approach | Telecoupling | Virtual water | Water management,,undefined,,,1518518

Human-nature interactions are complex and have important implications for achieving sustainable development goals and addressing other global challenges. Although numerous studies have explored human-nature (or human-environment) interactions and generated useful insights, they are largely disintegrated. Because conceptual frameworks are the foundation of quantitative and qualitative integration, many have been proposed but focus mainly on human-nature interactions within a specific system. To reflect human-nature interactions between distant coupled systems, the framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) has been developed. However, no framework has explicitly integrated human-nature interactions between adjacent coupled systems, let alone within a coupled system as well as between adjacent and distant coupled systems simultaneously. To fill such an important gap, in this paper I present an integrated framework of metacoupling: human-nature interactions within a system (intracoupling), between distant systems (telecoupling), and between adjacent systems (pericoupling). A metacoupled system is a set of two or more coupled systems that interact internally as well as nearby and far away, facilitated by agents affected by various causes with various effects. By differentiating and integrating intracoupling, pericoupling, and telecoupling, the metacoupling framework advances a systems perspective on global sustainability and human well-being. The framework can help uncover hidden systemic connections such as spillovers and feedbacks that may not be apparent when focusing on a particular system. To demonstrate the utility of the metacoupling framework, I illustrate its application to human-nature interactions within a global flagship nature reserve as well as between the reserve and the rest of the world. The illustration suggests that the framework has the potential to help holistically understand and integrate human-nature interactions from local to global scales, over time, and among organizational levels. Finally, I offer suggestions for operationalizing the metacoupling framework and discuss the need for new policy, governance, and management for a sustainable future across the metacoupled world.",43,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,['Liu J.'],['35491043300'],Anthropocene | Connection | Conservation | Coupled human and natural systems | Globalization | Human-environment interactions | Human-environmental systems | Human-nature interactions | Intercoupling | Intracoupling | Metacoupled systems | Metacoupling | Metacoupling framework | Paris Agreement | Pericoupling | Social-ecological systems | Sustainability | Sustainable development goals | Telecoupling | Telecoupling framework,,undefined,"AgBioResearch, Michigan State University",,1518518

Soy occupies the largest area of agricultural land in Brazil, spreading from southern states to the Amazon region. Soy is also the most important agricultural commodity among Brazilian exports affecting food security and land use nationally and internationally. Here we pose the question of whether soy expansion affects only economic growth or whether it also boosts socioeconomic development, fostering education and health improvements in Brazilian municipalities where it is planted. To achieve this objective, we divided more than 5000 municipalities into two groups: those with > 300 ha of soy (soy municipalities) and those with < 300 ha of soy (non-soy municipalities). We compared the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Gini coefficient for income for these two groups of municipalities in 1991, 2000, and 2010. We made such comparison at the municipality level for the whole country, but we also grouped the municipalities by major geographical regions and states. We found that the HDI was higher in soy municipalities, especially in the agricultural frontier. That effect was not so clear in more consolidated agricultural regions of the country. Soy municipalities also had a higher Gini coefficient for income than non-soy municipalities. We concluded that soy could be considered a precursor of socioeconomic development under certain conditions; however, it also tends to be associated with an increase in income inequality, especially in the agricultural frontier.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009625', 'afid': '60009625', 'affilname': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa', 'affiliation-city': 'Brasilia', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Martinelli L.', 'Batistella M.', 'da Silva R.', 'Moran E.']","['7102366222', '6508328264', '49862903000', '7202641088']",Brazil | Development | Gini coefficient | HDI | Soy,FAPESP,2015/25892-7,FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo,,1518518

The telecoupling framework is therefore well-positioned to provide new insights to persistent global sustainability challenges. To operationalize the framework, we have developed the Telecoupling GeoApp, a new web-based component of the Telecoupling Toolbox that provides researchers and practitioners with a useful platform to address globally important issues such as international trade, species invasion, biodiversity conservation, and land-use change. The GeoApp features mapping and geospatial analysis tools to visualize and quantify the five major interrelated components of the telecoupling framework (systems, flows, agents, causes, and effects). In this paper, we demonstrate the GeoApp's functionality by applying it to a case study in which distant systems interact across space and time: the Brazil-China soybean telecoupling.

All rights reserved. Protecting the environment and enhancing food security are among the world’s Sustainable Development Goals and greatest challenges. International food trade is an important mechanism to enhance food security worldwide. Nonetheless, it is widely concluded that in international food trade importing countries gain environmental benefits, while exporting countries suffer environmental problems by using land and other resources to produce food for exports. Our study shows that international food trade can also lead to environmental pollution in importing countries. At the global level, our metaanalysis indicates that there was increased nitrogen (N) pollution after much farmland for domestically cultivated N-fixing soybeans in importing countries was converted to grow high N-demanding crops (wheat, corn, rice, and vegetables). The findings were further verified by an intensive study at the regional level in China, the largest soybean-importing country, where the conversion of soybean lands to corn fields and rice paddies has also led to N pollution. Our study provides a sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that only exports contribute substantially to environmental woes.

Land use change driven by diet, globalization, and technology advancement have greatly influenced agricultural production and environment in the mollisols region of China, with a marked impact on the depletion of soil organic matter, a signature property of mollisols. Here we report findings on soil organic carbon (SOC) change in three different cropping systems (soybean, soybean/maize, corn) in Northeast China during a 10-year time span. The results indicated that the decline rate of SOC in recent ten years (0.27 g kg-1 yr-1) has slowed down considerably compared to previous decades (1.12 g kg-1 yr-1). Crop system conversion from soybean monocropping to corn monocropping or break system was the critical factor for SOC change, and the background SOC was the second influence factor. When approaching a SOC turning point, conversion from low carbon input crop system (soybeans monocropping) to high carbon input crop system helped slow down the SOC decline (break crop) or even improve SOC (corn monocropping) in mollisols regions. This result implied that imported soybean has brought benefit for Northeast China.

Telecoupling is a novel interdisciplinary umbrella concept that enables natural and social scientists to understand and generate information for managing how humans and nature can sustainably coexist worldwide. The telecoupling framework gains its distinction by enabling researchers to dive deeply into systemic complexities, even if systems are far away from each other. It is also ambitious in its aim to meet challenges unencumbered by disciplines. To understand the forces affecting sustainability across local to global scales, it is essential to build a comprehensive set of spatially explicit tools for describing and quantifying multiple reciprocal socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances. We introduce the Telecoupling Toolbox, the first set of tools developed to map and identify the five major interrelated components of the telecoupling framework: systems, flows, agents, causes, and effects. The modular design of the toolbox allows the integration of existing tools and software to assess synergies and trade-offs associated with policies and other local to global interventions. We show applications of the toolbox by using two representative telecoupling case studies that address a variety of socioeconomic and environmental issues. The results suggest that the toolbox can systematically map and quantify multiple telecouplings under various contexts while providing users with an easy-to-use interface. It is our hope that the innovative, free, and open-source toolbox can provide a useful platform to address globally important issues, such as land use and land cover change, species invasion, migration, flows of ecosystem services, and trade of goods and products.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Tonini F.', 'Liu J.']","['55192227800', '35491043300']",CHANS | Coupled human-natural systems | Cross-scale interactions | Decision-support tools | Environmental interactions | Human-environment interactions | Socioeconomic interactions | Spatially explicit tools | Telecoupling | Telecoupling framework,NASA,undefined,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,1518518

Since the industrial revolution, human activities have both expanded and intensified across the globe resulting in accelerated land use change. Land use change driven by China’s development has put pressure on the limited arable land resources, which has affected grain production. Competing land use interests are a potential threat to food security in China. Therefore, studying arable land use changes is critical for ensuring future food security and maintaining the sustainable development of arable land. Based on data from several major sources, we analyzed the spatio-temporal differences of arable land among different agricultural regions in China from 2000 to 2010 and identified the drivers of arable land expansion and loss. The results revealed that arable land decreased by 5.92 million ha or 3.31%. Arable land increased in the north and decreased in the south of China. Urbanization and ecological restoration programs were the main drivers of arable land loss, while the reclamation of other land cover types (e.g., forest, grassland, and wetland) was the primary source of the increased arable land. The majority of arable land expansion occurred in the Northwest, but the centroid for grain production moved to northeast, which indicated that new arable land was of poor quality and did not significantly contribute to the grain production capacity.

In addition to yield increase, increasing cropping intensity may provide another promising opportunity to boost global crop production. However, spatially explicit information on the cropping intensity gap (CIG) of current global croplands is lacking. Here, we developed the first spatially explicit approach to measure the global CIG, which represents the difference between the potential and actual cropping intensity. Results indicate that the global average CIG around the year 2010 was 0.48 and 0.17 for the temperature- and temperature/precipitation-limited scenarios, respectively. Surprisingly, global harvest areas can be expanded by another 7.36 million km2 and 2.71 million km2 (37.55% and 13.83% of current global cropland) under the two scenarios, respectively. This will largely compensate the future global cropland loss due to increasing urbanization and industrialization. Latin America has the largest potential to expand its harvest area by closing the CIGs, followed by Asia. Some countries in Africa have a large CIG, meaning that some additional harvests can potentially be achieved. Our analysis suggests that reducing the CIG would provide a potential strategy to increase global food production without cropland expansion, thus also helping achieve other Sustainable Development Goals such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000840', 'afid': '60000840', 'affilname': 'International Food Policy Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wu W.', 'Yu Q.', 'You L.', 'Chen K.', 'Tang H.', 'Liu J.']","['55707483300', '34874249400', '9743314500', '57209628464', '23029494800', '35491043300']",Actual cropping intensity | Cropland | Cropping intensity gap | Harvest area gap | Potential cropping intensity,CAAS,2017YFD0300201,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837717313315,1518518

Around the globe, previously isolated rural areas are increasingly connected with other distant places (e.g., cities) by telecouplings (i.e., environmental and socioeconomic interactions over distances) such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs, labor migration, and tourism. Although many studies have estimated impacts of telecouplings in rural areas, little is known about how these impacts might in turn affect telecouplings themselves through feedbacks. Using household survey data collected in China’s Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), we evaluated an unexpected impact of the telecoupling of the Grain to Green Program (GTGP)—one of the largest PES programs in the world. This impact may trigger a feedback that can strengthen the GTGP in the future. A previous study in Wolong found that afforestation on marginal cropland promoted by the GTGP has significantly intensified crop damage by wildlife on nearby remaining cropland. We evaluated how this change might in turn affect the GTGP by estimating the impact of crop damage induced by the current GTGP on local households’ willingness to participate in possible future GTGP. Our results show that due to the impact of the current GTGP on crop damage, local households may enroll 10.4% more cropland that is close to the afforested lands in future GTGP, which suggests a positive feedback that will strengthen the influences of the GTGP in Wolong and beyond. Our study highlights that local human–nature interactions driven by telecouplings, such as human–wildlife conflicts, may trigger feedbacks that affect telecouplings themselves. With improved understanding of telecouplings’ feedbacks, scientists, policy-makers, and conservation practitioners can better anticipate the complex interactions among different places and design effective conservation strategies for achieving sustainability objectives such as those set by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069743', 'afid': '60069743', 'affilname': 'China West Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanchong', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yang H.', 'Lupi F.', 'Zhang J.', 'Chen X.', 'Liu J.']","['56888146800', '6701734845', '12041725600', '36552055500', '57202270607']",Conservation | Ecosystem services | Feedback | Giant panda | Telecoupling | Wolong,MSU,41571517,Michigan State University,,1518518

One important vehicle for telecoupling is international agricultural trade, which has previously been addressed using multiregional input-output (MRIO) methods. This study advances that work by accounting for market-mediating factors based on the GTAP-BIO model. We apply this framework to analyze the economic and environmental consequences of the Brazilian soybean boom. We decompose the drivers of this telecoupled system into five groups – macroeconomic growth, soybean productivity, other crop productivity, government policies, and pasture and forestry factors – quantifying each socio-economic driver's local and distant contributions to all human and natural changes in this system. We find that China's macroeconomic growth boosted soybean production and exports from Brazil and the US, whereas macroeconomic growth in the latter two regions actually dampened soybean exports over the 2004–2011 period under examination. Brazil's strong soybean productivity growth over this period, allowed that country to become dominant in the global soybean market. It also had strong spillover effects, displacing the US in the Chinese market and reducing overall growth in soybean output in the US.

Diverse conservation efforts have been expanding around the globe, even under the stress of increasing agricultural production. A striking example is the supply-chain agreements put upon the Amazon forest which had reduced deforestation by 80% from the early 2000s (27,772 km2) to 2015 (6207 km2). However, evaluation of these conservation efforts usually focused on the impacts within the Amazon biome only, while the effects that spill over to other areas (e.g., displacement of environmental pressure from one area to another) were rarely considered. Ignoring spillover effects may lead to biased or even wrong conclusions about the effectiveness of these conservation efforts because the hidden cost outside the target area of conservation may offset the achievement within it. It is thus important to assess the spillover effects of these supply-chain agreements. In this study, we used the two supply-chain agreements (i.e., Soy Moratorium and zero-deforestation beef agreement) implemented in the Amazon biome as examples and evaluated their spillover effects to the Cerrado. To achieve a holistic evaluation of the spillover effects, we adopted the telecoupling framework in our analysis. The application of the telecoupling framework includes the interactions between distant systems and extends the analytical boundaries beyond the signatory areas, which fill the gap of previous studies. Our results indicate that the supply-chain agreements have significantly reduced deforestation by half compared to projections within the sending system (i.e., Pará State in the Amazon, which exports soybeans and other agricultural products), but at the cost of increasing deforestation in the spillover system (i.e., a 6.6 time increase in Tocantins State of the Cerrado, where deforestation was affected by interactions between the Amazon and other places). Our study emphasizes that spillover effects should be considered in the evaluation and planning of conservation efforts, for which the telecoupling framework works as a useful tool to do that systematically.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dou Y.', 'da Silva R.', 'Yang H.', 'Liu J.']","['57104527800', '49862903000', '56888146800', '57202270607']",Amazon | Brazil | Cerrado | conservation | deforestation | development | soybean trade | spillover | telecoupling | voluntary agreement,FAPESP,1518518,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,,1518518

Fisheries are coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) across distant places, yet fisheries research has generally focused on better understanding either fisheries ecology or human dimensions in a specific place, rather than their interactions over distances. As economic and ideational globalization accelerate, fisheries are becoming more globally connected via movements of fish products and fisheries finances, information, and stakeholders throughout the world. As such, there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assess these linkages among global fisheries, their effects on ecosystems and food security, and their implications for fisheries science and sustainability. Use of the telecoupling framework is a novel and insightful method to systematically evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions among CHANS. We apply the telecoupling framework to the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery, the world’s largest single-species commercial fishery and a complex CHANS. The anchoveta fishery has diverse and significant telecouplings, socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances, with the rest of the world, including fishmeal and fish oil trade, monetary flow, knowledge transfer, and movement of people. The use of the telecoupling framework reveals complex fishery dynamics such as feedbacks (e.g., profit maximization causing fishery overcapitalization) and surprises (e.g., stock collapse) resulting from local and long-distance ecological and socioeconomic interactions. The Peruvian anchoveta fishery illustrates how the telecoupling framework can be used to systematically assess the magnitude and diversity of local and distant fisheries interactions and thereby advance knowledge derived from traditional monothematic research approaches. Insights from the telecoupling framework provide a foundation from which to develop sustainable fisheries policy and management strategies across local, national, and international levels in a globalized world.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Carlson A.', 'Taylor W.', 'Liu J.', 'Orlic I.']","['56903721600', '7402890793', '35491043300', '57195343416']",Anchoveta | Environmental interactions | Peru | Socioeconomic interactions | Telecoupling framework | Telecouplings,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518518

We address this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing causal attribution in the telecoupling literature (n = 89 studies) and developing a standardized causal terminology and typology for consistent use in telecoupling research. Causes are defined based on six criteria: sector (e.g., environmental, economic), system of origin (i.e., sending, receiving, spillover), agent, distance, response time (i.e., time lapse between cause and effect), and direction (i.e., producing positive or negative effects). Using case studies from the telecoupling literature, we demonstrate the need to enhance the rigor of telecoupling causal attribution by combining qualitative and quantitative methods via process-tracing, counterfactual analysis, and related approaches. Rigorous qualitative-quantitative causal attribution is critical for accurately assessing the social-ecological causes and consequences of telecouplings and thereby identifying leverage points for informed management and governance of telecoupled systems.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60077281', 'afid': '60077281', 'affilname': 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)', 'affiliation-city': 'Bonn', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071539', 'afid': '60071539', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Rio Piedras', 'affiliation-city': 'San Juan', 'affiliation-country': 'Puerto Rico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020486', 'afid': '60020486', 'affilname': 'University of Bern', 'affiliation-city': 'Bern', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014059', 'afid': '60014059', 'affilname': 'Martin-Universität Halle-Wittenberg', 'affiliation-city': 'Halle', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004518', 'afid': '60004518', 'affilname': 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108441639', 'afid': '108441639', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Tierra del Fuego', 'affiliation-city': 'Ushuaia', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Review,"['Carlson A.K.', 'Zaehringer J.G.', 'Garrett R.D.', 'Silva R.F.B.', 'Furumo P.R.', 'Rey A.N.R.', 'Torres A.', 'Chung M.G.', 'Li Y.', 'Liu J.']","['56903721600', '56784239400', '37661304800', '49862903000', '57193676999', '7202860877', '57204313950', '55810581800', '57189034471', '57202270607']",Causality | Cause | Coupled human and natural systems | Effect | Telecoupling,FAPESP,14/50628-9,FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo,,1518518

Over the past two decades, the demands of nature-based tourism have been rapidly growing worldwide, yet it is not clear how tourist demands for water, food, and infrastructure influence the ecosystem services (ES), which are often the bedrock of an area's economic, cultural, and natural wealth. With a general conceptual model that applies the telecoupling framework, this study identifies complex interrelationships between the demand for nature-based tourism, which is a type of cultural ES, ES supply, and the economy simultaneously, using China's Qinghai Province as a demonstration site. The province is the origin of three rivers, making it crucial for water retention and prime for tourism. The results indicate that there is a strong spatial interaction between the number of tourism attractions and water retention. The southern Qinghai region's natural resources are protected by the Sanjiangyuan (three rivers headwater) National Park. From 2010-2014, tourists in the Sanjiangyuan region spent more money than those in the northern Qinghai region, which has accelerated the development of tourism infrastructures. The Sanjiangyuan region may face the unexpected degradation of its natural habitats due to rapid tourism development. Our findings suggest that new management plans are needed to minimize the negative impacts from the demands of distant tourists, and preserve the region that supports both the environment and the economy.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031150', 'afid': '60031150', 'affilname': 'Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363', 'afid': '60027363', 'affilname': 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/107975397', 'afid': '107975397', 'affilname': 'Guangdong Urban and Rural Planning and Design Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Guangzhou', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chung M.', 'Pan T.', 'Zou X.', 'Liu J.']","['55810581800', '57205164959', '57194167611', '57202270607']",Demand | Ecosystem services | Nature-based tourism | Protected areas | Supply | Telecoupling | Tourist consumption,NASA,41671037,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,1518518

The relationships between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services (ES) are widely debated. However, it is still not clear how biodiversity conservation and ES interact with different strategies in and surrounding protected areas (PAs), the cornerstone for biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results on the interplay between biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism (a cultural ES), while controlling for environmental and socioeconomic factors in and surrounding terrestrial PAs worldwide. Results indicate that nature-based tourism is more frequent in PAs that are of higher biodiversity, older, larger, more accessible from urban areas and at higher elevation. High population density surrounding PAs and national income levels are also major socioeconomic factors related to nature-based tourism. Furthermore, PAs managed mainly for biodiversity conservation have nearly 35% more visitors than those managed for mixed use. Strict management for biodiversity is also associated with increased biodiversity. These results show the importance of biodiversity in addressing nature-based tourism and suggest this interrelationship could be altered by different management strategies used by PAs.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chung M.', 'Dietz T.', 'Liu J.']","['55810581800', '7006695029', '57202270607']",Biodiversity conservation | Coupled human and natural systems | Ecosystem services | Nature-based tourism | Protected areas | Telecoupling,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2212041617307623,1518518

Telecoupling refers to socioeconomic and environmental interactions between distant coupled human and natural systems, and has become more extensive and intensive in the globalized era. The integrated framework of telecoupling examines flows of information, energy, matter, people, organisms, and other things such as financial capital and goods and products around the globe. It pinpoints causes and effects arising from engagement of diverse agents in the global sphere. This first special feature on telecoupling includes 16 articles that explore diverse telecouplings including trade, migration, tourism, information exchange, and transnational product certification schemes. Here we synthesize the articles by describing eight overarching lessons learned. These include the impact of physical, social, and institutional distance on telecouplings, key roles of agents and their inter-relationships, and the important function of telecoupling in enhancing information signals over long distances. Several lessons directly apply to global sustainability challenges, such as the importance of recognizing trade-offs between local and global sustainability and the need for multi-level management and governance solutions. We also suggest five areas of future research to help propel this nascent field forward and further cement its applicability to addressing global sustainability challenges.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Editorial,"['Hull V.', 'Liu J.']","['24472727900', '57202270607']",Coupled human and natural systems | Feedbacks | Globalization | Spillover | Telecoupling,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518518

Many global challenges, though interconnected, have been addressed singly, at times reducing one problem while exacerbating others. Nexus approaches simultaneously examine interactions among multiple sectors. Recent quantitative studies have revealed that nexus approaches can uncover synergies and detect trade-offs among sectors. If well implemented, nexus approaches have the potential to reduce negative surprises and promote integrated planning, management and governance. However, application and implementation of nexus approaches are in their infancy. No studies have explicitly quantified the contributions of nexus approaches to progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. To further implement nexus approaches and realize their potential, we propose a systematic procedure and provide perspectives on future directions. These include expanding nexus frameworks that consider interactions among more sectors, across scales, between adjacent and distant places, and linkages with Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating overlooked drivers and regions; diversifying nexus toolboxes; and making these strategies central in policy-making and governance for integrated Sustainable Development Goal implementation.",64,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851', 'afid': '60026851', 'affilname': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025182', 'afid': '60025182', 'affilname': 'Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung', 'affiliation-city': 'Potsdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015157', 'afid': '60015157', 'affilname': 'Stockholm Environment Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009731', 'afid': '60009731', 'affilname': 'Universität Osnabrück', 'affiliation-city': 'Osnabruck', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100416372', 'afid': '100416372', 'affilname': 'Pacific Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Oakland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Liu J.', 'Hull V.', 'Godfray H.C.J.', 'Tilman D.', 'Gleick P.', 'Hoff H.', 'Pahl-Wostl C.', 'Xu Z.', 'Chung M.G.', 'Sun J.', 'Li S.']","['57202270607', '24472727900', '7006467388', '7005020351', '57207607639', '7102907897', '6701479303', '56815847700', '55810581800', '55555282300', '37860915000']",,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518518

Such growth has generated many environmental challenges with enormous ecological, socioeconomic, and health consequences in China and beyond. Although the overall quality of air and water is starting to improve, both are still below national and international standards. Water shortages are widespread. Biodiversity continues to decline. China is the world's top CO 2 emitter, although per capita emissions are much lower than those of developed counties. On the positive side, large national conservation programs have been implemented, including the Natural Forest Conservation Program, the Grain-to-Green Program, Ecosystem Functional Conservation Areas, and Ecological Protection Redlines. More than 2,750 nature reserves have been established and a new national park system is being constructed. Some endangered and threatened species, such as the giant panda, are showing signs of recovery, and forest cover and some ecosystem services have increased. These mixed environmental outcomes result from human-nature interactions within China as well as between China and adjacent and distant countries. These include increasing rapid economic growth, resource consumption, land use change, trade and investment, and conservation and development policies.

The metacoupling framework provides grounds for characterizing interactions within and between coupled human and natural systems, yet few studies quantify the nuances of these systems. Network analysis is a powerful and flexible tool that has been used to quantify social, economic, and ecological systems. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of network analysis for quantifying metacoupled systems by assessing global soybean trade among 217 countries from 1986 to 2013. We identified and quantified sending and receiving systems, subnetworks and flow pathways, changes over time and across scales, feedbacks, and associations between trade and tropical deforestation. Although a total of 165 distinct cliques were identified within the network, a few key players were disproportionately influential in the 2872 partnerships, including Brazil (37.5%), China (48.6%), and the USA (72.3%). Total network density increased five-fold over the study period with an increasingly smaller set of countries heavily engaged in trade, posing sustainability and food security concerns. We found evidence of a positive feedback where countries with established trade partnerships were more likely to expand trade relationships over the study period. Trade patterns were not explained by regional or continental geography, highlighting limitations of neighborhood analyses commonly used in ecology. We also found evidence of a link between soybean trade and tropical deforestation; in pantropical countries participating in soybean trade, cumulative soybean exports for the period 2000–2012 were strongly associated with remotely sensed estimates of forest loss by country (Rsq = 0.35, p < 0.0001). We demonstrated that network analyses can be used to quantitatively assess relationships between metacoupled social-ecological systems. Increased data access and platforms for integrating diverse data sources using multidisciplinary tools will be key to pushing the boundaries of quantitative metacoupled systems research.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032280', 'afid': '60032280', 'affilname': 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031826', 'afid': '60031826', 'affilname': 'Southern Utah University', 'affiliation-city': 'Cedar City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017383', 'afid': '60017383', 'affilname': 'Nature Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015573', 'afid': '60015573', 'affilname': 'The University of Tulsa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tulsa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002316', 'afid': '60002316', 'affilname': 'Victoria University of Wellington', 'affiliation-city': 'Wellington', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001456', 'afid': '60001456', 'affilname': 'Boise State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boise', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Schaffer-Smith D.', 'Tomscha S.A.', 'Jarvis K.J.', 'Maguire D.Y.', 'Treglia M.L.', 'Liu J.']","['56744729600', '56431223700', '8642605400', '55909314900', '56780033000', '57202270607']",Agriculture | Brazil | China | Connectivity | Coupled human and natural systems | Export | Graph theory | Import | Social-ecological systems | Telecoupling | USA,DOD,NNX13AQ15H,U.S. Department of Defense,,1518518

We found that the volumes of all these flows, except for land flow, increased over time. Financial capital flows increased most (188.9%), followed by flows of CO2 (59.3%), energy (58.1%), water (50.7%) and nitrogen (10.5%), while land transfer decreased by 8.8%. Volumes of virtual material flows among distant countries were much higher than those among adjacent countries. The top five countries accounted for a surprisingly large proportion (47% to 80%) of total flow volumes. Different kinds of virtual material flows tended to enhance each other through synergistic effects, and CO2 and nitrogen flows tended to have stronger positive synergetic impacts on the other virtual material flows.

Land-use changes across distant places are increasingly affected by international agricultural trade, but most of the impacts and feedback remain unknown. The telecoupling framework–an analytical tool for examining socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances–can be used to conceptualize the impacts of agricultural trade on land-use change and feedbacks across borders of importing and exporting countries and across spatio-temporal scales of land systems.

The international trade of forestry and agricultural commodities leads distant regions across the globe to become connected through flows of products, information and capital. To deal with the sustainability and socioeconomic challenges of these interconnections, the ‘telecoupling’ conceptual framework has emerged. The telecoupling framework takes a coupled human-natural system approach to understand connections between different systems, classifying them as ‘sending’, ‘receiving’ and ‘spillover’ systems. This paper uses the telecoupling framework to investigate how distant systems are connected through flows of eco-certified forestry products and demonstrates how these connections drive environmental law compliance at the rural property level. We identify rural properties with eucalyptus plantations in Paraíba Valley, São Paulo State, Brazil as a sending system, and trace the outgoing flows of cellulose pulp to receiving systems. China and the European Union are the receiving systems, having been the major importers over the last 10 years. Using a multitemporal and spatial approach, we found that between 1995 and 2005 rural properties containing eucalyptus plantations with FSC certification had higher rates of native forest cover regeneration than properties without FSC certification. Native forest conservation and regrowth in rural properties in Paraíba Valley is an effect of the telecoupled system based on the international demand of eco-certified cellulose pulp from elsewhere. Additionally, we find that the telecoupled system also results in impacts on surrounding areas in the Atlantic forest landscapes, which we identify as an adjacent spillover system.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011520', 'afid': '60011520', 'affilname': ""King's College London"", 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009625', 'afid': '60009625', 'affilname': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa', 'affiliation-city': 'Brasilia', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118839997', 'afid': '118839997', 'affilname': 'Imaflora', 'affiliation-city': 'Piracicaba', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['da Silva R.', 'Batistella M.', 'Palmieri R.', 'Dou Y.', 'Millington J.']","['49862903000', '6508328264', '57208760739', '57104527800', '8248988800']",Agri-commodity supply chains | Public environmental policies | Spillover system | Telecoupling | Voluntary agreements,FAPESP,14/50628-9,FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1389934118305707,1518518

In an increasingly interconnected world, human-environment interactions involving flows of people, organisms, goods, information, and energy are expanding in magnitude and extent, often over long distances. As a universal paradigm for examining these interactions, the telecoupling framework (published in 2013) has been broadly implemented across the world by researchers from diverse disciplines. We conducted a systematic review of the first five years of telecoupling research to evaluate the state of telecoupling science and identify strengths, areas to be improved, and promising avenues for future study. We identified 89 studies using any derivation of the term telecoupling. These works emphasize trade flows, information transfer, and species dispersal at international, national, and regional scales involving one or a few countries, with China, Brazil, and the United States being the most frequently studied countries. Our review showed a rising trend in publications and citations on telecoupling, with 63% of identified telecoupling studies using the framework's specific language (e.g., ""flows"", ""agents""). This result suggests that future telecoupling studies could apply the standardized telecoupling language and terminology to better coordinate, synthesize, and operationalize interdisciplinary research. Compelling topics for future research include operationalization of the telecoupling framework, commonalities among telecouplings, telecoupling mechanisms and causality, and telecoupled systems governance. Overall, the first five years of telecoupling research have improved our understanding of human-environment interactions, laying a promising foundation for future social-ecological research in a telecoupled world.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071539', 'afid': '60071539', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Rio Piedras', 'affiliation-city': 'San Juan', 'affiliation-country': 'Puerto Rico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570', 'afid': '60029570', 'affilname': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas', 'affiliation-city': 'Campinas', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022355', 'afid': '60022355', 'affilname': 'University of Montana', 'affiliation-city': 'Missoula', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547', 'afid': '60020547', 'affilname': 'Texas A&amp;M University', 'affiliation-city': 'College Station', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020486', 'afid': '60020486', 'affilname': 'University of Bern', 'affiliation-city': 'Bern', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014966', 'afid': '60014966', 'affilname': 'Peking University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014059', 'afid': '60014059', 'affilname': 'Martin-Universität Halle-Wittenberg', 'affiliation-city': 'Halle', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008042', 'afid': '60008042', 'affilname': 'Universität Leipzig', 'affiliation-city': 'Leipzig', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}]",Journal,Review,"['Kapsar K.E.', 'Hovis C.L.', 'da Silva R.F.B.', 'Buchholtz E.K.', 'Carlson A.K.', 'Dou Y.', 'Du Y.', 'Furumo P.R.', 'Li Y.', 'Torres A.', 'Yang D.', 'Wan H.Y.', 'Zaehringer J.G.', 'Liu J.']","['57206263047', '57197783515', '49862903000', '57206276201', '56903721600', '57104527800', '56267645600', '57193676999', '57189034471', '57204313950', '57192425769', '56197059600', '56784239400', '57202270607']",Coupled human and natural systems | Globalization | Human-environment interactions | Interdisciplinary research | Social-ecological systems | Systems integration | Telecoupling,MSU,1518518,Michigan State University,,1518518

All rights reserved. The global demand for palm oil has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010365', 'afid': '60010365', 'affilname': 'The University of British Columbia', 'affiliation-city': 'Vancouver', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254', 'afid': '60009254', 'affilname': 'Purdue University', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Taheripour F.', 'Hertel T.W.', 'Ramankutty N.']","['24385808500', '7006465820', '6701824742']",Deforestation | Economic impacts | Malaysia and Indonesia | Market-mediated responses | Palm oil restriction,NIFA,IND01053G2,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1518518

Technology, transportation and global appetites have transformed trade relationships between near and distant countries. The impact of distant food demand on local agricultural production and trade has attracted considerable scientific scrutiny, yet little is known about how distant trade affects trade relationships and production between adjacent countries. In this paper, we explore this important issue by examining international food trade and agriculture production, which represent how distant places are connected through trade networks. By analyzing patterns of soybean, corn and wheat trading between 1991-2016 under the framework of metacoupling (human-nature interactions within, as well as between adjacent and distant systems), this study provides new insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of trade flows. Results reveal that telecoupled (between distant countries) trade interacts with the geo-political landscape to enhance or offset intracoupled (within country) production and pericoupled (between neighboring countries) trade. Evidence from the literature and the results of autoregressive integrated moving average models indicate that when restrictions are placed on distant export routes, pericoupled trade increased. The extent to which the telecoupled food trade affected the pericoupled trade and intracoupled processes holds implications for the true extent of production driven by distant demands.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Herzberger A.', 'Chung M.', 'Kapsar K.', 'Frank K.', 'Liu J.']","['56464253500', '55810581800', '57206263047', '7202165895', '57202270607']",ARIMA | International trade | Intracoupling | Metacoupling | Pericoupling | Soybeans | Telecoupling | Trade barriers,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1518518

Most geographical regions are, however, not closed systems but are open and telecoupled with other regions, such that the use of ES in one location is dependent on ecosystem processes and ecological management in other locations. Interregional ES flows often affect national economies and may trigger issues of national security and global equity. To date, however, methodologies for assessing interregional flows of ES have been published in dispersed literature. This paper provides a three-step guidance for how to assess four different types of interregional ES flows (traded goods, passive biophysical flows, species migration and dispersal as well as information flows). This guidance is intended to complement national and regional ecosystem assessments. The three steps are to (i)define the goal and scope of interregional ES flow assessments, (ii)quantify the interregional ES flows using a tiered approach and (iii)interpret results in terms of uncertainties, consequences and governance options. We compile different indicators for assessing interregional ES flows and evaluate their suitability for national and regional ES assessments. Finally, to assess the implications of interregional ES flows for environmental sustainability and human well-being, we relate our flow indicators to the Sustainable Development Goals.

Nest boxes for predators in agricultural regions are an easily implemented tool to improve local habitat quality with potential benefits for both conservation and agriculture. The potential for nest boxes to increase raptor populations in agricultural regions is of particular interest given their positions as top predators. This study examined the effects of cherry orchard nest boxes on the local breeding population of a declining species, the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), in a fruit-growing region of Michigan. During the 2013–2016 study, we added a total of 23 new nest boxes in addition to 24 intact boxes installed previously; kestrels used up to 100% of our new boxes each season. We conducted temporally-replicated surveys along four roadside transects divided into 1.6 km × 500 m sites. We developed a multi-season occupancy model under a Bayesian framework and found that nest boxes had strong positive effects on first-year site occupancy, site colonization, and site persistence probabilities. The estimated number of occupied sites increased between 2013 and 2016, which correlated with the increase in number of sites with boxes. Kestrel detections decreased with survey date but were not affected by time of day or activity at the boxes themselves. These results indicate that nest boxes determined the presence of kestrels at our study sites and support the conclusion that the local kestrel population is likely limited by nest site availability. Furthermore, our results are highly relevant to the farmers on whose properties the boxes were installed, for we can conclude that installing a nest box in an orchard resulted in a high probability of kestrels occupying that orchard or the areas adjacent to it.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shave M.', 'Lindell C.']","['57193682275', '6701323594']",,NIFA,MICL05052,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1518366

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society Suppression of pest species via a native predator is a regulating ecosystem service that has the potential to limit crop damage and produce economic benefits. American kestrels Falco sparverius are widespread, highly mobile, generalist predators that hunt in human-dominated habitats and have the potential to provide previously undocumented ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. We hypothesized that kestrel activity associated with nest boxes and artificial perches acts to increase perceived predation risk that, in combination with direct predation, can reduce fruit-eating bird abundances in orchards. We used counts and observations of fruit-eating birds from fixed-width transect surveys to investigate variation in bird abundances and to estimate sweet cherry loss in cherry orchards with and without active kestrel boxes. We also conducted a benefit–cost analysis of nest box installation and used regional economic modelling to estimate macroeconomic impacts of increased sweet cherry production in Michigan, an important US fruit production region. Fruit-eating bird counts were significantly lower at orchards with active kestrel boxes. Although kestrels used the perches in young orchard blocks and may benefit from them, the presence of perches did not have a significant effect on bird counts. Benefit–cost ratios for kestrel nest boxes indicated that for every dollar spent on nest boxes, $84 to $357 of sweet cherries would be saved from fruit-eating birds. Regional economic modelling predicted that increased sweet cherry production from reduced bird damage would result in 46–50 jobs created and $2.2 million to $2.4 million in increased income for the state of Michigan over a 5-year period. Synthesis and applications. Kestrel nest boxes in sweet cherry orchards provide a highly cost-effective ecosystem service with potential reverberating benefits for a regional economy. Box occupancy rates will undoubtedly vary across landscapes and regions. However, costs to install and maintain boxes are small and, even if box occupancy rates are low, boxes can direct kestrel activity to particular places in agricultural landscapes where they can deter pest birds. Thus, the potential benefits for fruit crops greatly outweigh the costs of this pest management strategy.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032434', 'afid': '60032434', 'affilname': 'USDA APHIS National Wildlife Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shave M.', 'Shwiff S.', 'Elser J.', 'Lindell C.']","['57193682275', '6603400315', '56367571300', '6701323594']",agriculture | artificial perches | benefit–cost ratio | ecosystem services | integrated pest management | kestrel | nest box | regional economic modelling,,GNC15-211,,,1518366

Crop pests are a constant challenge for farmers. Recent investigations demonstrate that vertebrates consume numerous crop pests and that this consumption often reduces crop damage, a key ecosystem service. Pest-consuming vertebrates can be attracted to agricultural areas through several strategies that we refer to as landscape enhancements: 1) providing critical structures and materials like nest boxes and roosts, 2) managing habitat/landscape complexity, 3) reintroducing native species, and 4) reducing invasive species’ impacts on target species. In addition to the potential for lower crop damage, attracting pest-consuming vertebrate to agricultural areas could: reduce use of pesticides, aid in the conservation of declining species, provide cultural ecosystem services like wildlife watching, and respond to consumer preferences regarding food production. Some of these benefits provide potential economic advantages to food producers. Our search of past research indicated that relatively few systematic studies have investigated vertebrate effects on crop pests and even fewer have studied how enhancements may increase trophic effects resulting in lower crop damage. Birds are the most studied vertebrate with regard to effects on crop pests, arthropods are the most studied pest group, and a plurality of studies have taken place in coffee and cacao. We lack information about key ecological and social questions related to enhancements including the contexts in which vertebrate predators are most likely to be attracted to enhancements and reduce crop pests, the potential economic benefits of enhancements, and how to marshal the human resources to install, maintain, and monitor enhancements. Addressing these questions will increase understanding of the interactions of vertebrate predators and their prey, the ways in which these interactions provide ecosystem services, and the roles of humans in protecting and encouraging these interactions.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005286', 'afid': '60005286', 'affilname': 'Rice University', 'affiliation-city': 'Houston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Lindell C.', 'Eaton R.', 'Howard P.', 'Roels S.', 'Shave M.']","['6701323594', '55560892800', '20733927700', '55782551200', '57193682275']",agroecosystem | ecosystem service | enhancement | pest | vertebrate,,2014-38640-22156,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167880918300501,1518366

Infrastructure functions akin to an ecosystem, having dynamic relationships and interdependencies. However, with age, urban infrastructure can deteriorate and stop functioning. Additional pressures on infrastructure include urbanizing populations and a changing climate that exposes vulnerabilities. To manage the urban infrastructure ecosystem in a modernizing world, urban planners need to integrate a coordinated management plan for these co-located and dependent infrastructure features. To implement such a management practice, an improved method for communicating how these infrastructure features interact is needed. This study aims to define urban infrastructure as a system, identify the systematic barriers preventing implementation of a more coordinated management model, and develop a virtual reality tool to provide visualization of the spatial system dynamics of urban infrastructure. Data was collected from a stakeholder workshop that highlighted a lack of appreciation for the system dynamics of urban infrastructure.

Agent-based models (ABMs) are powerful for handling such complexity in CHANS models, facilitating in-depth understanding of CHANS dynamics. ABMs have been employed mostly on a site-specific basis, however. Little of this work provides a common infrastructure with which CHANS researchers (especially nonmodeling experts) can comprehend, compare, and envision CHANS processes and dynamics. We advance the science of CHANS by developing a CHANS-oriented protocol based on the overview, design concepts, and details (ODD) framework to help CHANS modelers and other researchers build, document, and compare CHANS-oriented ABMs. Using this approach, we show how complex demographic decisions, environmental processes, and human-environment interaction in CHANS can be represented and simulated in a relatively straightforward, standard way with ABMs by focusing on a comparison of two world-renowned CHANS: the Wolong Nature Reserve in China and the Chitwan National Park in Nepal. The four key lessons we learn from this cross-site comparison in relation to CHANS models include how to represent agents and the landscape, the need for standardized modules for CHANS ABMs, the impacts of scheduling on model outcomes, and precautions in interpreting ""surprises"" in CHANS model outcomes.

Furthermore, with the increasing availability of longitudinal land-change data, evidence is needed on the relative performance of these two different methods in situations with differing levels of data abundance. To fill this gap, we generated a pseudo land-change data set using an agent-based model of residential development in a virtual landscape. This agent-based model simulated the decisions of homebuyers in choosing residential locations based on the values of several spatial variables. Pseudo land-change maps, generated by the agent-based model with different weights on these spatial variables, were exposed to statistical analysis under the logistic and survival approaches. We evaluated how well the two approaches could reveal the spatial variables that were used in the agent-based model and compared the performance of the two methods when land-change data were collected under different sampling frequencies. Our results suggest that survival analysis outperforms logistic regression in detecting the variables that were included in agent decisions, largely because it takes into account time-dependent variables. Also, this research suggests that various properties of land-change processes (like amount of developed area and access of agents to information) affect the relative performance of these statistical approaches aimed at uncovering land-change predictor variables. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wang N.', 'Brown D.G.', 'An L.', 'Yang S.', 'Ligmann-Zielinska A.']","['55488609000', '56975641800', '7102775296', '57216099559', '16242023100']",agent-based model | land-change science | logistic regression | pseudo data set | space-time analysis | survival analysis,NSF,DEB-1212183,National Science Foundation,,1212183

The effectiveness of conservation investments in PES may differ under alternative policy scenarios and may not be sustainable because of uncertainties in human responses to policies and dynamic human-nature interactions. To assess the impacts of these interactions on the effectiveness of PES programs, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model: human and natural interactions under policies (HANIP). We used HANIP to study the effectiveness of China's Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and alternative policy scenarios in a coupled human-nature system, China's Wolong Nature Reserve, where indigenous people's use of fuelwood affects forests. We estimated the effects of the current NFCP, which provides a cash payment, and an alternative payment scenario that provides an electricity payment by comparing forest dynamics under these policies to forest dynamics under a scenario in which no payment is provided. In 2007, there were 337 km2 of forests in the study area of 515 km2. Under the baseline projection in which no payment is provided, the forest area is expected to be 234 km2 in 2030. Under the current NFCP, there are likely to be 379 km2 of forests in 2030, or an increase of 145 km2 of forests to the baseline projection. If the cash payment is replaced with an electricity payment, there are likely to be 435 km2 of forests in 2030, or an increase of 201 km2 of forests to the baseline projection. However, the effectiveness of the NFCP may be threatened by the behavior of newly formed households if they are not included in the payment scheme. In addition, the effects of socio-demographic factors on forests will also differ under different policy scenarios. Human and natural interactions under policies (HANIP) and its modeling framework may also be used to assess the effectiveness of many other PES programs around the world. © 2014 by the author(s).",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chen X.', 'Viña A.', 'Shortridge A.', 'An L.', 'Liu J.']","['36552055500', '7003596463', '6507648010', '7102775296', '35491043300']",Agent-based modeling | Conservation investments | Coupled human-nature systems | Fuelwood | Natural Forest Conservation Program | Payments for ecosystem services,,undefined,,,1212183

AThis letter explores factors affecting the quantification and mapping of forest canopy fractional cover (CFC), and explores causes of CFC change. CFC was quantified using a simple linear mixture model based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) derived from Landsat TM surface reflectance data of Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China. Different soil and vegetation endmembers were tested to analyse the sensitivity of the mixture model. Illumination effects due to topographical variability are found to influence MSAVI and therefore CFC estimates.

Using the space-time data collected at county level for the whole United States through webpage search on the keyword “climate change,” we show that LTMs, when combined with eigenvector filtering of spatial dependence in data, are very useful in unveiling temporal trends hidden in such data: the webpage-data derived popularity measure for climate change has been increasing from December 2011 to March 2013, but the increase rate has been slowing down. In addition, LTMs help reveal potential mechanisms behind observed space-time trajectories through linking the webpage-data derived popularity measure about climate change to a set of socio-demographic covariates. Our analysis shows that controlling for population density, greater drought exposure, higher percent of people who are 16 years old or above, and higher household income are positively predictive of the trajectory slopes. Higher percentages of Republicans and number of hot days in summer are negatively related to the trajectory slopes.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Introduction: As challenges to biodiversity mount, land-use policies have been implemented to balance human needs and the integrity of ecological systems. One such program, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), incentivizes resource users to protect ecosystem services and has been implemented around the world to reduce soil erosion, create or improve wildlife habitats, and improve water quality and other environmental goals. The PES policy, at its core, is a concept that aims to capture the reciprocal relationships between human systems and ecological function and process. As such, PES epistemologically embodies a coupled human and natural systems approach. Outcomes: Yet, despite this conceptual alignment, the on-the-ground implementation or evaluation of PES typically does not adopt this coupled approach and PES programs have little integration between socioeconomic, sociocultural, human demographic, and ecological elements. To advance the evolution of PES, we consider what and how socioeconomic and ecological factors have been incorporated into PES program implementation and evaluation. We also present a conceptual model to articulate how PES research can capture the reciprocal relationships among socioeconomics, demography, and ecology and discuss the quantitative modeling approaches that can support this conceptual development, i.e., structural equation and agent-based modeling, and latent trajectory models. Conclusions: By strengthening the conceptual framework for PES within a coupled human and natural systems approach and identifyinganalytical approaches that can be used to quantify and characterize these complex cross-disciplinary relationships, we aim to support the evolution and advancement of PES, in service of more meaningful and positive outcomes for human well-being and ecological sustainability.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lewison R.', 'An L.', 'Chen X.']","['6603135119', '7102775296', '36552055500']",Agent-based modeling | disciplinary integration | ecological responses | human socioeconomics | latent trajectory models | structural equation modeling,NSF,DEB-1212183,National Science Foundation,,1212183

AThis letter explores factors affecting the quantification and mapping of forest canopy fractional cover (CFC), and explores causes of CFC change. CFC was quantified using a simple linear mixture model based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) derived from Landsat TM surface reflectance data of Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China. Different soil and vegetation endmembers were tested to analyse the sensitivity of the mixture model. Illumination effects due to topographical variability are found to influence MSAVI and therefore CFC estimates. Implementing an illumination stratification that selects different closed canopy endmembers for different topographic-related illumination strata generally minimizes these effects. The spatial distribution and possible causes of CFC change were examined.

Drylands support pastoralist social-ecological systems around the world. Ecological function in these water-limited environments frequently depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear interactions between water, soil, vegetation, and herbivores. Numerous complexity-based approaches have modeled localized ecohydrological feedbacks to yield insights into dryland landscape organization and emergent dynamics. The relevance of these models to management and sustainability continues to increase as researchers incorporate ecological processes at multiple scales and social-ecological variables like herding practices. However, many processes vary in their importance depending on ecological context, so there is a continuing need to construct models tailored to different contexts. We developed a model for semi-arid rangelands that experience highly variable rainfall, substantial Hortonian runoff during rain events, patchy vegetation structure, and grazing-influenced patch transitions. The model couples an existing, mechanistic cellular automata model of hillslope water balance with a dynamic vegetation model in which probabilistic transitions between bare, annual grass, perennial grass patches depend on soil moisture and grazing intensity. The model was parameterized based on a field site in Kenya, from which we had empirical hydrological measurements and several years of patch-to-hillslope scale measurements of vegetation structure. The model domain is a 100 × 100 grid of 2 × 2 m cells, it simulates seasonal cycles of growing seasons followed by dry seasons, and it computes daily soil moisture based on stochastic rainfall forcings. Patch type transitions can occur twice during each seasonal cycle: at the end of the growing season, with probabilities based on average growing-season soil moisture availability; and at the end of the dry season, with probabilities based on grazing intensity and antecedent growing-season soil moisture. By parameterizing grazing intensity as a per-patch impact, it can be interpreted as the degree of forage depletion at which a herder decides to leave the area. We conducted a series of simulation experiments, principally altering runoff channelization and grazing intensity. The model generated plausible vegetation dynamics across the range of grazing intensities simulated. Vegetation cover fluctuated seasonally, but never collapsed completely, even at the highest grazing intensity. At low to intermediate grazing, we observed multi-decadal switches in fractional perennial cover, triggered by periods of below- or above-average rainfall. At low to intermediate grazing intensities, we noted emergent spatial patterning in the form of a step-like increase in vegetation density in the lower half of the domain. With a vegetation patch transitions governed by mechanistic water balance dynamics as well as grazing intensities that represent herder decision-making, the model holds great potential for further explorations of how land use, climate, and spatial heterogeneity affect the functioning of a dryland pastoralist social-ecological system.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026306', 'afid': '60026306', 'affilname': 'University of Nebraska–Lincoln', 'affiliation-city': 'Lincoln', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['King E.', 'Franz T.']","['23569892800', '35268331200']",Cellular automata | Ecohydrology | Grazing | Runoff | Semi-arid | Transition,GoK,1313659,Government of the Republic of Kenya,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304380016300485,1313659

The dynamics of customary land rights and displacement among east African pastoralists have been the subject of extensive scholarly inquiry. Displacement to make way for other land uses, government-led privatization schemes, endogenous subdivision to defend land against outsiders, and progressive enclosure of private land in the context of the recent ‘land rush’ are some of the documented trajectories of land tenure change. Less explored is how exogenous authority systems gain traction within common property regimes to re-shape the contours of property. Laikipia, Kenya presents an ideal context for this research given the uniquely ambitious effort to conserve globally significant wildlife on private land. We focus on a group ranch owned collectively by Maa-speaking pastoralists for whom formal title was secured with the support of outside actors vested in conservation, and coupled with efforts to provide financial incentives for conservation. Findings suggest the new governance structure established in the context of land titling has become a pathway through which outside authority gains traction–with consequences for property, sovereignty and the traction of green agendas. Findings deepen understanding of how shifting authority shapes processes of alienation and legitimation, and contribute to ongoing debates about land grabs, tenure formalization and neoliberal approaches to conservation.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['German L.', 'Unks R.', 'King E.']","['14007981500', '56491379600', '23569892800']",authority | green grabs | land titling | Maasai | neoliberal conservation | pastoralism | property,,undefined,,,1313659

A rich literature on the dynamics of subsequent subdivision of these “Group Ranches” elucidates a complex interplay of exogenous and endogenous drivers. This paper, on the contrary, explores the dynamic tensions between individualization and collectivization of land and related benefit flows in a group ranch that has thus far not undergone formal subdivision. Research was conducted in Koija Group Ranch, one of 13 group ranches located in Mukogodo Division, on the Laikipia plateau. Drawing on key informant interviews and focus group discussions with those differentially positioned relative to the benefits of de facto processes of rangeland exclosure, and household surveys to document trends in participation and perception, we explore how these processes are perceived and governed.

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. Predictions of warmer droughts causing increasing forest mortality are becoming abundant, yet few studies have investigated the mechanisms of forest persistence. To examine the resistance of forests to warmer droughts, we used a five-year precipitation reduction (∼45% removal), heat (+4 °C above ambient) and combined drought and heat experiment in an isolated stand of mature Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma. Despite severe experimental drought and heating, no trees died, and we observed only minor evidence of hydraulic failure or carbon starvation. Two mechanisms promoting survival were supported. First, access to bedrock water, or 'hydraulic refugia' aided trees in their resistance to the experimental conditions. Second, the isolation of this stand amongst a landscape of dead trees precluded ingress by Ips confusus, frequently the ultimate biotic mortality agent of piñon. These combined abiotic and biotic landscape-scale processes can moderate the impacts of future droughts on tree mortality by enabling tree avoidance of hydraulic failure, carbon starvation, and exposure to attacking abiotic agents.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105337', 'afid': '60105337', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Panamá', 'affiliation-city': 'Panama City', 'affiliation-country': 'Panama'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033021', 'afid': '60033021', 'affilname': 'The University of New Mexico', 'affiliation-city': 'Albuquerque', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032083', 'afid': '60032083', 'affilname': 'University at Buffalo, The State University of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'Buffalo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031148', 'afid': '60031148', 'affilname': 'Northern Forestry Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Edmonton', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023517', 'afid': '60023517', 'affilname': 'Northern Arizona University', 'affiliation-city': 'Flagstaff', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023471', 'afid': '60023471', 'affilname': 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Richland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010844', 'afid': '60010844', 'affilname': ""Universitat d'Alacant"", 'affiliation-city': 'Alicante', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008588', 'afid': '60008588', 'affilname': 'Eidgenössische Forschungsanstalt fur Wald, Schnee Und Landschaft Eth-Bereichs', 'affiliation-city': 'Birmensdorf', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006514', 'afid': '60006514', 'affilname': 'Oklahoma State University - Stillwater', 'affiliation-city': 'Stillwater', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006164', 'afid': '60006164', 'affilname': 'Los Alamos National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Alamos', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['McDowell N.G.', 'Grossiord C.', 'Adams H.D.', 'Pinzón-Navarro S.', 'Mackay D.S.', 'Breshears D.D.', 'Allen C.D.', 'Borrego I.', 'Dickman L.T.', 'Collins A.', 'Gaylord M.', 'McBranch N.', 'Pockman W.T.', 'Vilagrosa A.', 'Aukema B.', 'Goodsman D.', 'Xu C.']","['7004051964', '55004223400', '7202474945', '36244251800', '7402243803', '6701807556', '7402266526', '57194615963', '36457498500', '13410002300', '15029750400', '57191504733', '6602877476', '6506368946', '6701756758', '36473521600', '7404182103']",die-off | drought | precipitation | refugia | warming,,undefined,,,1824796

We present two highly resolved intertidal and nearshore food webs for the Sanak Archipelago in the eastern Aleutian Islands and use them to compare trophic roles of prehistoric humans to other species. We find that the native Aleut people played distinctive roles as super-generalist and highly-omnivorous consumers closely connected to other species. Although the human population was positioned to have strong effects, arrival and presence of Aleut people in the Sanak Archipelago does not appear associated with long-term extinctions. We simulated food web dynamics to explore to what degree introducing a species with trophic roles like those of an Aleut forager, and allowing for variable strong feeding to reflect use of hunting technology, is likely to trigger extinctions. Potential extinctions decreased when an invading omnivorous super-generalist consumer focused strong feeding on decreasing fractions of its possible resources. This study presents the first assessment of the structural roles of humans as consumers within complex ecological networks, and potential impacts of those roles and feeding behavior on associated extinctions.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117139', 'afid': '60117139', 'affilname': ""Musée canadien de l'histoire"", 'affiliation-city': 'Gatineau', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031706', 'afid': '60031706', 'affilname': 'Utah State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Logan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115241081', 'afid': '115241081', 'affilname': 'Vibrant Data Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'San Francisco', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113990116', 'afid': '113990116', 'affilname': 'Sandhill Institute for Complexity and Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dunne J.A.', 'Maschner H.', 'Betts M.W.', 'Huntly N.', 'Russell R.', 'Williams R.J.', 'Wood S.A.']","['7101823067', '6603112504', '8979372900', '6602548796', '55465342800', '57201236669', '15137355000']",,ISU,DBI-0850373,Idaho State University,,1642894

This study asks whether the spatial scale of sampling alters structural properties of food webs and whether any differences are attributable to changes in species richness and connectance with scale. Understanding how different aspects of sampling effort affect ecological network structure is important for both fundamental ecological knowledge and the application of network analysis in conservation and management. Using a highly resolved food web for the marine intertidal ecosystem of the Sanak Archipelago in the Eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska, we assess how commonly studied properties of network structure differ for 281 versions of the food web sampled at five levels of spatial scale representing six orders of magnitude in area spread across the archipelago. Species (S) and link (L) richness both increased by approximately one order of magnitude across the five spatial scales. Links per species (L/S) more than doubled, while connectance (C) decreased by approximately two-thirds. Fourteen commonly studied properties of network structure varied systematically with spatial scale of sampling, some increasing and others decreasing. While ecological network properties varied systematically with sampling extent, analyses using the niche model and a power-law scaling relationship indicate that for many properties, this apparent sensitivity is attributable to the increasing S and decreasing C of webs with increasing spatial scale. As long as effects of S and C are accounted for, areal sampling bias does not have a special impact on our understanding of many aspects of network structure. However, attention does need be paid to some properties such as the fraction of species in loops, which increases more than expected with greater spatial scales of sampling. This study investigates whether commonly studied properties of network structure vary with spatial scale, using highly resolved empirical food webs for the marine intertidal of the Sanak Archipelago in the Eastern Aleutian Islands. We find through analyses using niche and power-law scaling models that although raw structural properties of networks vary systematically with sampling extent, across six orders of magnitude, many of these apparent sensitivities are attributable to the increasing richness and decreasing connectance of larger-scale food webs.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wood S.', 'Russell R.', 'Hanson D.', 'Williams R.', 'Dunne J.']","['15137355000', '55465342800', '55322206600', '57201236669', '7101823067']",Complexity | Diet | Diversity | Predation | Sampling area | Scale dependence | Trophic interactions,,undefined,,,1642894

Yet ethnohistoric documents and the Tahitian lexicon suggest a broader role for Ma'ohi (indigenous Tahitian) ceremonial architecture as the foci of individual and corporate ceremonies of a religious, economic and political nature. Utilising a spatio-Temporal perspective, I investigate the function of feasting at terraces attached to a range of community and familial level temples, in addition to communal spaces within residential sites in the Society Islands. My goal is to explore the ways that Ma'ohi household leaders, chiefs and priests may have utilised feasting to materialise their economic authority, while at the same time facilitating the formation of communal identities. I utilise archaeological data to identify feasting at monumental architectural sites of varying scale and complexity and house sites of differing status. I then turn to ethnographic analogy and social theory to suggest differing functions of feasting at different site types. As I argue, feasting serves as a highly visible social act, representing not only a political leader's generosity, but delineating boundaries of particular social groups and control over resources. In the Society Island chiefdoms, at both the household and community scales, feasting is strongly correlated, but not uniquely associated with, ceremonial sites and served varied secular and sacred functions. I conclude that feasting actively solidified local and community level leader's economic, socio-political and ideological power in varied ceremonial contexts of the late prehistoric Society Island chiefdoms.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,['Kahn J.'],['16301610500'],Ceremonial architecture | Communal identity | Feasting | Society islands | Socio-political strategies | Spatio-Temporal analyses,,undefined,,,1642894

All rights reserved. A classic measure of ecological stability describes the tendency of a community to return to equilibrium after small perturbations. While many advances show how the network architecture of these communities severely constrains such tendencies, one of the most fundamental properties of network structure, i.e. degree heterogeneity - the variability of the number of links associated with each species, deserves further study. Here we show that the effects of degree heterogeneity on stability vary with different types of interspecific interactions. Degree heterogeneity consistently destabilizes ecological networks with both competitive and mutualistic interactions, while its effects on networks of predator-prey interactions such as food webs depend on prey contiguity, i.e. the extent to which the species consume an unbroken sequence of prey in community niche space. Increasing degree heterogeneity tends to stabilize food webs except those with the highest prey contiguity. These findings help explain why food webs are highly but not completely interval and, more broadly, deepen our understanding of the stability of complex ecological networks.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073652', 'afid': '60073652', 'affilname': 'Tongji University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014334', 'afid': '60014334', 'affilname': 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002746', 'afid': '60002746', 'affilname': 'Harvard Medical School', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yan G.', 'Martinez N.', 'Liu Y.']","['36665489700', '7102372533', '52563770900']",Degree heterogeneity | Ecological networks | Stability,,undefined,,,1642894

Given limited theoretical and empirical understanding of ecological robustness to such perturbations, we simulated invasions of complex ecological networks by integrating the ‘niche model’ of food web structure and a nonlinear bioenergetic model of population dynamics. Overall, 7958 successful invasions by 100 different invaders in 150 food webs with 15–29 original species (mean 20) and 5–38% connectance (mean 16%) showed that most (61%) communities were robust to invasion in that they experienced no species loss. The distribution of robustness in terms of the fraction of native species that persisted (mean 94%) was skewed with a long tail reaching to values as low as 20%. Loss of a single species occurred less frequently (14% of cases) than ‘extinction cascades’ involving the loss of two or more species (25% of cases). These cascades were often caused by invaders with many prey species and few predator species. While low-connectance webs and webs invaded by omnivores were most likely to lose at least one additional species, high-connectance webs experiencing extinction cascades lost the most species, especially when invaded by secondary consumers. These and earlier simulation results suggest how the structure of invaded communities and the properties of invaders involve trade-offs among robustness and resistance to invasion. For example, high-connectance communities are highly resistant and robust to invasion overall but lose the most species in the relatively few cases when extinctions occur. Low-connectance webs are the least resistant and more often lack robustness but lose the fewest species in the relatively many cases when extinctions occur. Broadly speaking, these findings suggest that high connectance makes food webs rigidly resistant to invasion but more brittle once such rigidity is breached. Low-connectance webs are less rigid while more flexibly suffering fewer extinctions when extinctions occur.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015913', 'afid': '60015913', 'affilname': 'Dalhousie University', 'affiliation-city': 'Halifax', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113670134', 'afid': '113670134', 'affilname': 'Pacific Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology Lab', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Book Series,Chapter,"['Romanuk T.', 'Zhou Y.', 'Valdovinos F.', 'Martinez N.']","['6602927096', '55718523700', '24598355900', '7102372533']",Biodiversity loss | Complexity | Connectance | Dynamic | Food web | Invasive species | Network | Nonlinear | Trophic,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0065250416300599,1642894

The results demonstrate that, at around the 17th century AD, at least three zones of the lowland coastal band had been successfully modeled into a productive and varied horticultural landscape. At this time, native forests and coastal woodlands surrounding the sites under investigation had been transformed into culturally significant and economically productive treescapes. These complex manipulations of the vegetation likely started during the early phases of human settlement, with current datasets indicating the presence of a specific coastal vegetation including socially important and/or cultivated taxa associated with the first known occupation of the island, dated to the 13th-14th century AD. The records further provide direct archaeobotanical evidence for the early presence of planted trees such as Artocarpus altilis, Aleurites moluccana, Ficus and Casuarina equisetifolia, the prehistoric association of Ficus trees to marae structures and elite occupation, and the late appearance of Inocarpus fagifer in East Polynesia. The archaeological contexts of the assemblages demonstrate differential access to woody resources and use of vegetation units, depending on social rank and site function. Finally, our case studies confirm the profound anthropogenic transformation of Maupiti's vegetation during prehistoric times, but likewise reveal the complex nature of this phenomenon.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031806', 'afid': '60031806', 'affilname': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008950', 'afid': '60008950', 'affilname': 'Australian National University', 'affiliation-city': 'Canberra', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dotte-Sarout E.', 'Kahn J.']","['55961106300', '16301610500']",Anthracology | Arboriculture | East Polynesia | Forests | Trees,NSF,CNH #1313830,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1040618216305560,1642894

The location of the immediate eastern Polynesian origin for the settlement of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), remains unclear with conflicting archeological and linguistic evidence. Previous genetic commensal research using the Pacific rat, Rattus exulans; a species transported by humans across Remote Oceania and throughout the Polynesian Triangle, has identified broad interaction spheres across the region. However, there has been limited success in distinguishing finer-scale movements between Remote Oceanic islands as the same mitochondrial control region haplotype has been identified in the majority of ancient rat specimens. To improve molecular resolution and identify a pattern of prehistoric dispersal to Easter Island, we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes from ancient Pacific rat specimens obtained from early archeological contexts across West and East Polynesia. Ancient Polynesian rat haplotypes are closely related and reflect the widely supported scenario of a central East Polynesian homeland region from which eastern expansion occurred. An Easter Island and Tubuai (Austral Islands) grouping of related haplotypes suggests that both islands were established by the same colonization wave, proposed to have originated in the central homeland region before dispersing through the south-eastern corridor of East Polynesia.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031226', 'afid': '60031226', 'affilname': 'Curtin University', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491', 'afid': '60018491', 'affilname': 'Simon Fraser University', 'affiliation-city': 'Burnaby', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017311', 'afid': '60017311', 'affilname': 'University of Otago', 'affiliation-city': 'Dunedin', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['West K.', 'Collins C.', 'Kardailsky O.', 'Kahn J.', 'Hunt T.L.', 'Burley D.V.', 'Matisoo-Smith E.']","['57215562490', '36633862400', '15754163200', '16301610500', '8273146900', '7004232335', '6602155766']",Ancient DNA | Easter Island | Mitochondrial haplotypes | Polynesia | Prehistoric dispersal | Rattus exulans,,undefined,,,1642894

Nonmarine mollusks recovered during archaeological excavations on the island of Mo'orea, Society Islands, French Polynesia, were analyzed as part of a multidisciplinary study of anthropogenic environmental change. Records of now-extinct taxa in dated archaeological contexts were combined with historic collection data from the 1830s to the present to determine the chronology of extinction of the 10 species of land snails of the family Endodontidae that formerly inhabited the island. One species known only from a stratum antedating human settlement on the island and three known only archaeologically but from imprecisely dated strata were certainly extinct by the late nineteenth century but may have disappeared earlier. One species collected in 1838 was extinct by the late nineteenth century, and all of the described endodontid species present in the mid- to late nineteenth century are undoubtedly now extinct because none was collected by the 1934 Mangarevan Expedition or by subsequent collectors. Only a single unidentified living endodontid has been observed on Mo'orea since the nineteenth century. Additional extinctions or extirpations have occurred among the Helicarionidae, terrestrial Assimineidae, and probably also in the Helicinidae. Four new species of Endodontidae are described: Libera kondoi, Minidonta opunohua, Nesodiscus nummus, and N. cookei. Libera jacquinoti, described in 1850 from poorly localized material and until now not collected subsequently, is shown to have inhabited Mo'orea.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003575', 'afid': '60003575', 'affilname': 'Bishop Museum', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Christensen C.', 'Kahn J.', 'Kirch P.']","['7201582665', '16301610500', '6603913279']",,NSF,BCS-1029765,National Science Foundation,,1642894

This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108626', 'afid': '60108626', 'affilname': 'The Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research', 'affiliation-city': 'As', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103673', 'afid': '60103673', 'affilname': 'Itä-Suomen yliopisto', 'affiliation-city': 'Kuopio', 'affiliation-country': 'Finland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072277', 'afid': '60072277', 'affilname': 'Senckenberg Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum', 'affiliation-city': 'Frankfurt am Main', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027152', 'afid': '60027152', 'affilname': 'Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Uppsala', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020585', 'afid': '60020585', 'affilname': 'University of Canterbury', 'affiliation-city': 'Christchurch', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150', 'afid': '60015150', 'affilname': 'Imperial College London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011832', 'afid': '60011832', 'affilname': 'Université de Sherbrooke', 'affiliation-city': 'Sherbrooke', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009507', 'afid': '60009507', 'affilname': 'University of Montreal', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gravel D.', 'Baiser B.', 'Dunne J.', 'Kopelke J.', 'Martinez N.', 'Nyman T.', 'Poisot T.', 'Stouffer D.', 'Tylianakis J.', 'Wood S.', 'Roslin T.']","['12796736600', '23970250900', '7101823067', '8744419300', '7102372533', '7005847675', '35225250000', '8395488800', '8514120500', '15137355000', '6603524750']",co-occurrence | networks | spatial ecology,,PHY-1240192,National Science Foundation,,1642894

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Although most conservation efforts address the direct, local causes of biodiversity loss, effective long-term conservation will require complementary efforts to reduce the upstream economic pressures, such as demands for food and forest products, which ultimately drive these downstream losses. Here, we present a wildlife footprint analysis that links global losses of wild birds to consumer purchases across 57 economic sectors in 129 regions. The United States, India, China, and Brazil have the largest regional wildlife footprints, while per-person footprints are highest in Mongolia, Australia, Botswana, and the United Arab Emirates. A US$100 purchase of bovine meat or rice products occupies approximately 0.1 km2 of wild bird ranges, displacing 1–2 individual birds, for 1 year. Globally significant importer regions, including Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and France, have large footprints that drive wildlife losses elsewhere in the world and represent important targets for consumption-focused conservation attention.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121458', 'afid': '60121458', 'affilname': 'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121456', 'afid': '60121456', 'affilname': 'Energy &amp; Resources Group', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019660', 'afid': '60019660', 'affilname': 'Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt', 'affiliation-city': 'Klagenfurt', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007174', 'afid': '60007174', 'affilname': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001319', 'afid': '60001319', 'affilname': 'Missouri Botanical Garden', 'affiliation-city': 'St. Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115241081', 'afid': '115241081', 'affilname': 'Vibrant Data Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'San Francisco', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100450309', 'afid': '100450309', 'affilname': 'Global Footprint Network', 'affiliation-city': 'Oakland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100389551', 'afid': '100389551', 'affilname': 'Pacific Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology Lab', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Kitzes J.', 'Berlow E.', 'Conlisk E.', 'Erb K.', 'Iha K.', 'Martinez N.', 'Newman E.A.', 'Plutzar C.', 'Smith A.B.', 'Harte J.']","['12801961000', '6602671674', '8358289400', '7007026767', '55347689800', '7102372533', '55573751500', '6506917545', '55556139400', '7005624196']",Biodiversity | consumption | economics | footprint | GIS | human ecology | input output | land use | life cycle | spatial,FWF,P20812-G11,Austrian Science Fund,,1642894

Despite such influence, ecologists have typically ignored the effect of abiotic stochasticity on the structure and dynamics of ecological networks. Here we help to fill that gap by advancing the theory of how abiotic stochasticity, in the form of environmental noise, affects the population dynamics of species within food webs. We do this by analysing an allometric trophic network model of Lake Constance subjected to positive (red), negative (blue), and non-autocorrelated (white) abiotic temporal variability (noise) introduced into the carrying capacity of basal species. We found that, irrespective of the colour of the introduced noise, the temporal variability of the species biomass within the network both reddens (i.e. its positive autocorrelation increases) and dampens (i.e. the magnitude of variation decreases) as the environmental noise is propagated through the food web by its feeding interactions from the bottom to the top. The reddening reflects a buffering of the noise-induced population variability by complex food web dynamics such that non-autocorrelated oscillations of noise-free deterministic dynamics become positively autocorrelated. Our research helps explain frequently observed red variability of natural populations by suggesting that ecological processing of environmental noise through food webs with a range of species’ body sizes reddens population variability in nature.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032398', 'afid': '60032398', 'affilname': 'University of Jyvaskyla', 'affiliation-city': 'Jyvaskyla', 'affiliation-country': 'Finland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kuparinen A.', 'Perälä T.', 'Martinez N.', 'Valdovinos F.']","['16029152600', '56982894700', '7102372533', '24598355900']",coloured noise | ecosystem dynamics | environmental stochasticity,USDOE,ICER-1313830,U.S. Department of Energy,,1642894

Aim: To investigate the association between hummingbird-plant network structure and species richness, phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern, insularity and historical and current climate. Location: Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39°N-32°S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes. Methods: We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant-hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity). Results: Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R2=0.18-0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R2=0.20-0.44 and R2=0.32-0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability. Main conclusions: Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant-bird mutualistic systems.",48,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url':

Numerous exceptions have, however, been noted including complete pyramidal inversions. Elevated levels of biomass top-heaviness (i.e. high consumer/resource biomass ratios) have been reported from Arctic tundra communities to Brazilian phytotelmata, and in species assemblages as diverse as those dominated by sharks and ants. We highlight two major pathways for creating top-heaviness, via: (1) endogenous channels that enhance energy transfer across trophic boundaries within a community and (2) exogenous pathways that transfer energy into communities from across spatial and temporal boundaries. Consumer–resource models and allometric trophic network models combined with niche models reveal the nature of core mechanisms for promoting top-heaviness. Outputs from these models suggest that top-heavy communities can be stable, but they also reveal sources of instability.

Guided by ecological theory, we use data from multiple arthropod lineages across the Hawaiian archipelago to explore the interplay between ecological (population dynamics, dispersal, trophic interactions) and evolutionary (genetic structuring, adaptation, speciation, extinction) processes. Our goal is to show how communities develop from the dynamic feedbacks that operate at different temporal and spatial scales. Location: The Hawaiian islands (19–22° N, 155–160° W). Methods: We synthesize genetic data from selected arthropods across the Hawaiian archipelago to determine the relative role of dispersal and in situ differentiation across the island chronosequence. From four sites on three high islands with geological ages ranging from < 1 Ma to 5 Ma, we also generate ecological metrics on plant–herbivore bipartite networks drawn from the literature. We compare the structure of these networks with predictions derived from the principle of maximum information entropy. Results: From the perspective of the island chronosequence we show that species at lower trophic levels develop population genetic structure at smaller temporal and spatial scales than species at higher trophic levels. Network nestedness decreases while modularity increases with habitat age. Single-island endemics exhibit more specialization than broadly distributed species, but both show the least specialization in communities on middle-aged substrates. Plant–herbivore networks also show the least deviation from theoretical predictions in middle-aged communities. Main conclusions: The application of ecological theory to island chronosequences can illuminate feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes in community assembly. We show how patterns of population genetic structure, decreasing network nestedness, increasing network modularity and increased specialization shift from early assembly driven by immigration, to in situ diversification after > 1 Myr. Herbivore–plant communities only transiently achieve statistical steady state during assembly, presumably due to incomplete assembly from dispersal in the early stages, and the increasing influence of island ontogeny on older islands.",27,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121458', 'afid': '60121458', 'affilname': 'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025352', 'afid': '60025352', 'affilname': 'The Natural History Museum, London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025093', 'afid': '60025093', 'affilname': 'California Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'San Francisco', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016280', 'afid': '60016280', 'affilname': 'East Carolina University', 'affiliation-city': 'Greenville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014837', 'afid': '60014837', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaii at Hilo', 'affiliation-city': 'Hilo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100389551', 'afid': '100389551', 'affilname': 'Pacific Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology Lab', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rominger A.J.', 'Goodman K.R.', 'Lim J.Y.', 'Armstrong E.E.', 'Becking L.E.', 'Bennett G.M.', 'Brewer M.S.', 'Cotoras D.D.', 'Ewing C.P.', 'Harte J.', 'Martinez N.D.', ""O'Grady P.M."", 'Percy D.M.', 'Price D.K.', 'Roderick G.K.', 'Shaw K.L.', 'Valdovinos F.S.', 'Gruner D.S.', 'Gillespie R.G.']","['27968098300', '25630206000', '56420946300', '57193069252', '8889063800', '16835819500', '36766882300', '57195592927', '57189758982', '7005624196', '7102372533', '57207896656', '7006754700', '7403719576', '7004185518', '57203075382', '24598355900', '6602292645', '7102158431']",Arthropods | chronosequence | Hawaii | maximum entropy | networks | population genetics,,undefined,,,1642894

Species invasions constitute a major and poorly understood threat to plant-pollinator systems. General theory predicting which factors drive species invasion success and subsequent effects on native ecosystems is particularly lacking. We address this problem using a consumer-resource model of adaptive behavior and population dynamics to evaluate the invasion success of alien pollinators into plant-pollinator networks and their impact on native species. We introduce pollinator species with different foraging traits into network models with different levels of species richness, connectance, and nestedness. Among 31 factors tested, including network and alien properties, we find that aliens with high foraging efficiency are the most successful invaders. Networks exhibiting high alien-native diet overlap, fraction of alien-visited plant species, most-generalist plant connectivity, and number of specialist pollinator species are the most impacted by invaders. Our results mimic several disparate observations conducted in the field and potentially elucidate the mechanisms responsible for their variability.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033181', 'afid': '60033181', 'affilname': 'Instituto Argentino de Investigaciones de Zonas Aridas', 'affiliation-city': 'Mendoza', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023520', 'afid': '60023520', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso', 'affiliation-city': 'Valparaiso', 'affiliation-country': 'Chile'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022684', 'afid': '60022684', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Cuyo', 'affiliation-city': 'Mendoza', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012464', 'afid': '60012464', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Chile', 'affiliation-city': 'Santiago', 'affiliation-country': 'Chile'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005881', 'afid': '60005881', 'affilname': 'Universidad Mayor', 'affiliation-city': 'Providencia', 'affiliation-country': 'Chile'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118234852', 'afid': '118234852', 'affilname': 'Instituto de Dinámica Celular y Biotecnología', 'affiliation-city': 'Santiago', 'affiliation-country': 'Chile'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115241081', 'afid': '115241081', 'affilname': 'Vibrant Data Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'San Francisco', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Valdovinos F.', 'Berlow E.', 'Moisset De Espanés P.', 'Ramos-Jiliberto R.', 'Vázquez D.', 'Martinez N.']","['24598355900', '6602671674', '23978296000', '6603081714', '7102066323', '7102372533']",,FONDECYT,1120958,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico, TecnolÃ³gico y de InnovaciÃ³n TecnolÃ³gica",,1642894

All rights reserved. A classic measure of ecological stability describes the tendency of a community to return to equilibrium after small perturbations. While many advances show how the network architecture of these communities severely constrains such tendencies, one of the most fundamental properties of network structure, i.e. degree heterogeneity - the variability of the number of links associated with each species, deserves further study. Here we show that the effects of degree heterogeneity on stability vary with different types of interspecific interactions. Degree heterogeneity consistently destabilizes ecological networks with both competitive and mutualistic interactions, while its effects on networks of predator-prey interactions such as food webs depend on prey contiguity, i.e. the extent to which the species consume an unbroken sequence of prey in community niche space. Increasing degree heterogeneity tends to stabilize food webs except those with the highest prey contiguity. These findings help explain why food webs are highly but not completely interval and, more broadly, deepen our understanding of the stability of complex ecological networks.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073652', 'afid': '60073652', 'affilname': 'Tongji University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014334', 'afid': '60014334', 'affilname': 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002746', 'afid': '60002746', 'affilname': 'Harvard Medical School', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yan G.', 'Martinez N.', 'Liu Y.']","['36665489700', '7102372533', '52563770900']",Degree heterogeneity | Ecological networks | Stability,,undefined,,,1642894

The goal was to conduct a first set of anthracological analyses on the island to reconstruct pre-European contact vegetation composition, histories of vegetation change and differential anthropogenic uses of woody resources according to various site functions. The results demonstrate that, at around the 17th century AD, at least three zones of the lowland coastal band had been successfully modeled into a productive and varied horticultural landscape. At this time, native forests and coastal woodlands surrounding the sites under investigation had been transformed into culturally significant and economically productive treescapes. These complex manipulations of the vegetation likely started during the early phases of human settlement, with current datasets indicating the presence of a specific coastal vegetation including socially important and/or cultivated taxa associated with the first known occupation of the island, dated to the 13th-14th century AD. The records further provide direct archaeobotanical evidence for the early presence of planted trees such as Artocarpus altilis, Aleurites moluccana, Ficus and Casuarina equisetifolia, the prehistoric association of Ficus trees to marae structures and elite occupation, and the late appearance of Inocarpus fagifer in East Polynesia. The archaeological contexts of the assemblages demonstrate differential access to woody resources and use of vegetation units, depending on social rank and site function. Finally, our case studies confirm the profound anthropogenic transformation of Maupiti's vegetation during prehistoric times, but likewise reveal the complex nature of this phenomenon.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031806', 'afid': '60031806', 'affilname': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008950', 'afid': '60008950', 'affilname': 'Australian National University', 'affiliation-city': 'Canberra', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dotte-Sarout E.', 'Kahn J.']","['55961106300', '16301610500']",Anthracology | Arboriculture | East Polynesia | Forests | Trees,NSF,CNH #1313830,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1040618216305560,1642894

All rights reserved. The Society Islands are critical to chronology building in East Polynesia, as the archipelago served as a potential first landfall for voyagers moving out of the West Polynesia homeland. Yet determining the particulars of migration sequences and settlement chronology in the Society Islands, like the rest of East Polynesia, has been challenging. Here, we report on a dating and re-dating program of four coastal sites on the island of Moorea, Windward Society Islands, aimed at refining the archipelago’s cultural chronology and its place within larger settlement trends for East Polynesia. We begin with a brief discussion of 1960s archaeological research in the Society Islands and the archipelago’s role in the East Polynesian colonisation debate before turning to a discussion of the newly dated and re-dated Mo‘orea coastal sites. Our new corpus of 14C dates provides evidence for two well-studied Mo‘orea Island sites dating to the Colonisation Phase (GS-1 and ScMf-5). The earliest dated occupation of the ScMf-5 site contained an earth oven, diverse artefacts and dense faunal remains indicative of a permanent, and perhaps large, settlement along the North shore of Moorea. Results point to established Society Island populations from the 11th to 13th centuries AD, supporting both the Conservative Model of East Polynesian settlement and more inclusive synthetic models. Developmental Phase dates from ScMf-2 illustrate that new parts of the Moorea North shore were inhabited at this time, while other earlier coastal sites continued to be occupied, tentatively suggesting population increase. The re-dated M5 site, with its elaborate temples of the ‘Oro cult style, fits well into accepted dates for the Classic Phase. Our re-dating program has not only allowed us to refine the Society Islands cultural sequence, but has permitted precise identification or confirmation of two sites dating to the Colonisation Phase.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003575', 'afid': '60003575', 'affilname': 'Bishop Museum', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Kahn J.', 'Sinoto Y.']","['16301610500', '6508220517']",Central east polynesia | Chronology building | Colonisation | Mo‘orea island | Settlement | Society islands,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1642894

The location of the immediate eastern Polynesian origin for the settlement of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), remains unclear with conflicting archeological and linguistic evidence. Previous genetic commensal research using the Pacific rat, Rattus exulans; a species transported by humans across Remote Oceania and throughout the Polynesian Triangle, has identified broad interaction spheres across the region. However, there has been limited success in distinguishing finer-scale movements between Remote Oceanic islands as the same mitochondrial control region haplotype has been identified in the majority of ancient rat specimens. To improve molecular resolution and identify a pattern of prehistoric dispersal to Easter Island, we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes from ancient Pacific rat specimens obtained from early archeological contexts across West and East Polynesia. Ancient Polynesian rat haplotypes are closely related and reflect the widely supported scenario of a central East Polynesian homeland region from which eastern expansion occurred. An Easter Island and Tubuai (Austral Islands) grouping of related haplotypes suggests that both islands were established by the same colonization wave, proposed to have originated in the central homeland region before dispersing through the south-eastern corridor of East Polynesia.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031226', 'afid': '60031226', 'affilname': 'Curtin University', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491', 'afid': '60018491', 'affilname': 'Simon Fraser University', 'affiliation-city': 'Burnaby', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017311', 'afid': '60017311', 'affilname': 'University of Otago', 'affiliation-city': 'Dunedin', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114', 'afid': '60016114', 'affilname': 'The College of William and Mary', 'affiliation-city': 'Williamsburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['West K.', 'Collins C.', 'Kardailsky O.', 'Kahn J.', 'Hunt T.L.', 'Burley D.V.', 'Matisoo-Smith E.']","['57215562490', '36633862400', '15754163200', '16301610500', '8273146900', '7004232335', '6602155766']",Ancient DNA | Easter Island | Mitochondrial haplotypes | Polynesia | Prehistoric dispersal | Rattus exulans,,undefined,,,1642894

However, prevailing resource-management strategies are not effectively conserving pools and other small natural features on private lands. Solutions are complicated by tensions between private property and societal rights, uncertainties over resource location and function, diverse stakeholders, and fragmented regulatory authority. The development and testing of new conservation approaches that link scientific knowledge, stakeholder decision-making, and conservation outcomes are important responses to this conservation dilemma. Drawing from a 15-y history of vernal pool conservation efforts in Maine, we describe the coevolution of pool conservation and research approaches, focusing on how research-based knowledge was produced and used in support of management decisions. As management shifted from reactive, top-down approaches to proactive and flexible approaches, research shifted from an ecology-focused program to an interdisciplinary program based on social-ecological systems. The most effective strategies for linking scientific knowledge with action changed as the decision-makers, knowledge needs, and context for vernal pool management advanced. Interactions among stakeholders increased the extent to which knowledge was coproduced and shifted the objective of stakeholder engagement from outreach to research collaboration and development of innovative conservation approaches. New conservation strategies were possible because of the flexible, solutions-oriented collaborations and trust between scientists and decision-makers (fostered over 15 y) and interdisciplinary, engaged research.

Migrations of animals can transfer energy and nutrients through and among terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Pool-breeding amphibians, such as the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), make annual breeding migrations to ephemeral wetlands in forest habitats in the eastern and midwestern United States and Canada. To model the influence of wood frogs on nutrient transport and transformation through time, we coupled long-term population monitoring data (1985-2005) from a wood frog population with estimates of the elemental composition of wood frog egg masses and emerging juveniles. Over the 21-year study period, 8.8 kg carbon (C), 2.0 kg nitrogen (N) and 0.20 kg phosphorus (P) were transported from the terrestrial to the aquatic habitat and approximately 21 kg C, 5.5 kg N and 1.2 kg P were exported to the surrounding terrestrial habitat by wood frogs. During the study period, the average net flux of C, N and P was from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, but the magnitude and direction of the net flux was element dependent. Thus, the net flux of C, N and P did not always flow in the same direction. Predicting long-term trends in nutrient and energy flux by organisms with biphasic life cycles should rely on long-term population data to account for temporal variability. This is especially true for organisms that are sensitive to long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, such as amphibians that breed in ephemeral pools.",39,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011873', 'afid': '60011873', 'affilname': 'Oakland University', 'affiliation-city': 'Rochester', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Capps K.', 'Berven K.', 'Tiegs S.']","['24472828200', '6603378812', '16029978600']",Animal migrations | Nutrient dynamics | Resource subsidies | Vernal pool | Wood frog,,undefined,,,1313627

Applied evolutionary biology provides a suite of strategies to address these global challenges that threaten human health, food security, and biodiversity.

The impacts of unmanaged evolution are pervasive, but approaches to address them have received little attention. We review the evolutionary challenges of managing populations in the Anthropocene and introduce the concept of prescriptive evolution, which considers how evolutionary processes may be leveraged to proactively promote wise management. We advocate the planned management of evolutionary processes and explore the advantages of evolutionary interventions to preserve and sustain biodiversity.

GIWs constitute most of the wetlands in many North American landscapes, provide a disproportionately large fraction of wetland edges where many functions are enhanced, and form complexes with other water bodies to create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the timing, flow paths, and magnitude of network connectivity. These attributes signal a critical role for GIWs in sustaining a portfolio of landscape functions, but legal protections remain weak despite preferential loss from many landscapes. GIWs lack persistent surface water connections, but this condition does not imply the absence of hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological exchanges with nearby and downstream waters. Although hydrological and biogeochemical connectivity is often episodic or slow (e.g., via groundwater), hydrologic continuity and limited evaporative solute enrichment suggest both flow generation and solute and sediment retention. Similarly, whereas biological connectivity usually requires overland dispersal, numerous organisms, including many rare or threatened species, use both GIWs and downstream waters at different times or life stages, suggesting that GIWs are critical elements of landscape habitat mosaics. Indeed, weaker hydrologic connectivity with downstream waters and constrained biological connectivity with other landscape elements are precisely what enhances some GIW functions and enables others. Based on analysis of wetland geography and synthesis of wetland functions, we argue that sustaining landscape functions requires conserving the entire continuum of wetland connectivity, including GIWs.",129,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60097412', 'afid': '60097412', 'affilname': 'CDM Smith Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032890', 'afid': '60032890', 'affilname': 'US EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Research Triangle Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032270', 'afid': '60032270', 'affilname': 'North Dakota State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fargo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021121', 'afid': '60021121', 'affilname': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliation-city': 'Bloomington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171', 'afid': '60014171', 'affilname': 'University of Waterloo', 'affiliation-city': 'Waterloo', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010884', 'afid': '60010884', 'affilname': 'Western University', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010526', 'afid': '60010526', 'affilname': 'Dynamac Corporation', 'affiliation-city': 'Rockville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007460', 'afid': '60007460', 'affilname': 'Joseph W.

We explore the category “geographically isolated wetlands” (GIWs; i.e., wetlands completely surrounded by uplands at the local scale) as used in the wetland sciences. As currently used, the GIW category (1) hampers scientific efforts by obscuring important hydrological and ecological differences among multiple wetland functional types, (2) aggregates wetlands in a manner not reflective of regulatory and management information needs, (3) implies wetlands so described are in some way “isolated,” an often incorrect implication, (4) is inconsistent with more broadly used and accepted concepts of “geographic isolation,” and (5) has injected unnecessary confusion into scientific investigations and discussions. Instead, we suggest other wetland classification systems offer more informative alternatives. For example, hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes based on well-established scientific definitions account for wetland functional diversity thereby facilitating explorations into questions of connectivity without an a priori designation of “isolation.” Additionally, an HGM-type approach could be used in combination with terms reflective of current regulatory or policymaking needs. For those rare cases in which the condition of being surrounded by uplands is the relevant distinguishing characteristic, use of terminology that does not unnecessarily imply isolation (e.g., “upland embedded wetlands”) would help alleviate much confusion caused by the “geographically isolated wetlands” misnomer.",57,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032270', 'afid': '60032270', 'affilname': 'North Dakota State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fargo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mushet D.', 'Calhoun A.', 'Alexander L.', 'Cohen M.', 'DeKeyser E.', 'Fowler L.', 'Lane C.', 'Lang M.', 'Rains M.', 'Walls S.']","['6505761128', '7003355466', '8045261900', '26642983100', '6506052180', '23988774300', '8985530800', '23469523100', '6603453482', '7003554955']",Adjacency | Connectivity gradients | HGM | Hydrogeomorphic classification | Rapanos | SWANCC | Wetland classification | Wetland connectivity,,undefined,,,1313627

Natural systems harbor complex interactions that are fundamental parts of ecology and evolution. These interactions challenge our inclinations and training to seek the simplest explanations of patterns in nature. Not least is the likelihood that some complex processes might be missed when their patterns look similar to predictions for simpler mechanisms. Along these lines, theory and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that environmental, ecological, phenotypic, and genetic processes can be tightly intertwined, resulting in complex and sometimes surprising eco-evolutionary dynamics. The goal of this review is to temper inclinations to unquestioningly seek the simplest explanations in ecology and evolution, by recognizing that some eco-evolutionary outcomes may appear very similar to purely ecological, purely evolutionary, or even null expectations, and thus be cryptic. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for observational biases and mechanisms that might operate among the various links in eco-evolutionary feedbacks to produce cryptic patterns. Recognition that cryptic dynamics can be associated with outcomes like stability, resilience, recovery, or coexistence in a dynamically changing world provides added impetus for finding ways to study them.",28,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Book Series,Article,"['Kinnison M.', 'Hairston N.', 'Hendry A.']","['7004032143', '7004905390', '7101656570']",Coevolution | Community genetics | Eco-evolutionary feedback | Evolutionary rescue | Rapid or contemporary evolution | Stabilizing selection,,undefined,,,1313627

We evaluated the current literature, coupled with our collective research expertise, on surface-water connectivity of wetlands considered to be “geographically isolated” (sensu Tiner Wetlands 23:494–516, 2003a) to critically assess the scientific foundation of grouping wetlands based on the singular condition of being surrounded by uplands. The most recent research on wetlands considered to be “geographically isolated” shows the difficulties in grouping an ecological resource that does not reliably indicate lack of surface water connectivity in order to meet legal, regulatory, or scientific needs. Additionally, the practice of identifying “geographically isolated wetlands” based on distance from a stream can result in gross overestimates of the number of wetlands lacking ecologically important surface-water connections. Our findings do not support use of the overly simplistic label of “geographically isolated wetlands”. Wetlands surrounded by uplands vary in function and surface-water connections based on wetland landscape setting, context, climate, and geographic region and should be evaluated as such. We found that the “geographically isolated” grouping does not reflect our understanding of the hydrologic variability of these wetlands and hence does not benefit conservation of the Nation’s diverse wetland resources. Therefore, we strongly discourage use of categorizations that provide overly simplistic views of surface-water connectivity of wetlands fully embedded in upland landscapes.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032270', 'afid': '60032270', 'affilname': 'North Dakota State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fargo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017470', 'afid': '60017470', 'affilname': 'Eastern Kentucky University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118159692', 'afid': '118159692', 'affilname': 'National Wetland Inventory', 'affiliation-city': 'Falls Church', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Calhoun A.', 'Mushet D.', 'Alexander L.', 'DeKeyser E.', 'Fowler L.', 'Lane C.', 'Lang M.', 'Rains M.', 'Richter S.', 'Walls S.']","['7003355466', '6505761128', '8045261900', '6506052180', '23988774300', '8985530800', '23469523100', '6603453482', '7201953553', '7003554955']",Clean Water Act | Connectivity | Geographic isolation | Hydrology | Streams | Upland embedded wetlands | Waters of the U.S,,undefined,,,1313627

GIWs constitute most of the wetlands in many North American landscapes, provide a disproportionately large fraction of wetland edges where many functions are enhanced, and form complexes with other water bodies to create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the timing, flow paths, and magnitude of network connectivity. These attributes signal a critical role for GIWs in sustaining a portfolio of landscape functions, but legal protections remain weak despite preferential loss from many landscapes. GIWs lack persistent surface water connections, but this condition does not imply the absence of hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological exchanges with nearby and downstream waters. Although hydrological and biogeochemical connectivity is often episodic or slow (e.g., via groundwater), hydrologic continuity and limited evaporative solute enrichment suggest both flow generation and solute and sediment retention. Similarly, whereas biological connectivity usually requires overland dispersal, numerous organisms, including many rare or threatened species, use both GIWs and downstream waters at different times or life stages, suggesting that GIWs are critical elements of landscape habitat mosaics. Indeed, weaker hydrologic connectivity with downstream waters and constrained biological connectivity with other landscape elements are precisely what enhances some GIW functions and enables others. Based on analysis of wetland geography and synthesis of wetland functions, we argue that sustaining landscape functions requires conserving the entire continuum of wetland connectivity, including GIWs.",129,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60097412', 'afid': '60097412', 'affilname': 'CDM Smith Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032890', 'afid': '60032890', 'affilname': 'US EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Research Triangle Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032270', 'afid': '60032270', 'affilname': 'North Dakota State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fargo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021121', 'afid': '60021121', 'affilname': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliation-city': 'Bloomington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171', 'afid': '60014171', 'affilname': 'University of Waterloo', 'affiliation-city': 'Waterloo', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010884', 'afid': '60010884', 'affilname': 'Western University', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010526', 'afid': '60010526', 'affilname': 'Dynamac Corporation', 'affiliation-city': 'Rockville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007740', 'afid': '60007740', 'affilname': 'University of South Florida, Tampa', 'affiliation-city': 'Tampa', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007460', 'afid': '60007460', 'affilname': 'Joseph W.

We radio-tracked 71 frogs in Maine during 2011–2013 and evaluated spring migration, foraging activity center (FAC), and within-FAC habitat selection. Telemetered frogs spent the greatest percentage of each field season in hibernacula (≥54.4%), followed by FACs (≥25.5%), migration habitat (≥16.9%), and breeding sites (≥4.5%). FACs ranged 49 – 1 335 m2 (568.0 ± 493.4 m2) and annual home ranges spanned 1 413 – 32 165 m2 (11 780.6 ± 12 506.1 m2). During spring migration, Wood Frogs exhibited different movement patterns (e.g., turn angles), selected different habitat features, and selected habitat features less consistently than while occupying FACs, indicating that the migration and foraging periods are ecologically distinct.

However, temporary streams and rivers are being degraded at alarming rates owing to development, hydromorphological alteration, and disposal of waste water, among other stressors, and pressure will likely increase under global change. Here we propose that it is key to manage temporary streams and rivers as a unique ecohydrological type and not as a permanent waterway or a terrestrial ecosystem. Nevertheless, two challenges hinder this goal. First, data availability on intermittent low regimes and associated biotas is currently scarce. As a consequence, flow-ecology relationships in temporary waterways are largely unknown, and appropriate metrics to define and monitor their ecological status are missing. Second, the ecological and social values of temporary streams and rivers are often underestimated, being regarded as secondary ecosystems relative to permanent waterways. To conserve temporary streams and rivers, ecologists need to define them as unique ecosystems and conservation targets, and practitioners need to systematically collect biological and hydrological data in these ecosystems. Innovative approaches at the intersection of ecology, citizen science, and management, can also contribute to their management and conservation by: i) mapping them, ii) informing people about their ecological values, iii) safeguarding them from further human threats, iv) preserving their flow regime when managing reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants, and water abstraction activities, and v) restoring physically-degraded temporary reaches (e.g. due to gravel mining and off-road use) or reaches that have lost historical flows due to increasing drought severity, diversions, and groundwater overuse.",44,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60151531', 'afid': '60151531', 'affilname': 'National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)', 'affiliation-city': 'Annapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110375', 'afid': '60110375', 'affilname': 'Catalan Institute for Water Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Girona', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Acuña V.', 'Hunter M.', 'Ruhí A.']","['23670461000', '35262167600', '57207900208']",Ecosystem management | Ecosystem services | Flow intermittency | Freshwater biodiversity conservation,NSF,2014 SGR 291,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320716311053,1313627

However, their size and perceived lack of significance also makes them more vulnerable to threats and destruction. We examine the management of SNFs and conservation of the associated ecosystem services they generate from an economics perspective. Using the economic concept of market failure, we identify three key themes that explain prevailing threats to SNFs and characterize impediments to and opportunities for SNF management: (1) the degree to which benefits derived from the feature spillover, beyond the feature itself (spatially and temporally); (2) the availability and quality of information about the feature and those who most directly influence its management; and (3) the existence and enforcement of property rights and legal standing of the feature. We argue that the efficacy of alternative SNF management approaches is highly case dependent and relies on four key components: (1) the specific ecosystem services of interest; (2) the amount of redundancy of the SNF on the landscape and the level of connectivity required by the SNF in order to provide ecosystem services; (3) the particular market failures that need correcting and their scope and extent; and (4) the magnitude and distribution of management costs.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026910', 'afid': '60026910', 'affilname': 'Clark University', 'affiliation-city': 'Worcester', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000144', 'afid': '60000144', 'affilname': 'Bowdoin College', 'affiliation-city': 'Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bauer D.', 'Bell K.', 'Nelson E.', 'Calhoun A.']","['7202230874', '7401917152', '56238505800', '7003355466']",Biodiversity | Conservation | Ecosystem services | Land use | Policy | Small natural feature,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320717300046,1313627

Thus the recognition and management of SNFs can be an efficient way to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. In particular, while the size of SNFs can engender threats (e.g., they are often overlooked and are relatively vulnerable to complete destruction), small size also leads to special conservation opportunities (e.g., integration with resource uses such as forestry or fisheries). Commonly, SNF conservation begins with education and inventory to form a foundation for appropriate, targeted protection and/or sustainable management. However, in cases of severe degradation or loss, more intensive activities such as restoration or creation may be required. Diverse approaches to conservation action are possible. For example, sometimes SNF conservation is undertaken incidentally to other efforts or on a voluntary basis; sometimes it involves substantial economic incentives or restrictive regulations. In general, the required investment for SNF conservation is likely to be smaller than that for larger areas, with disproportionate benefits given the substantial spatio-temporal influence of these features. In practice, conservation of SNFs should be complementary to traditional, larger-scale, forms of conservation by fostering creative, constructive efforts to conserve some seemingly minor features; features that have previously unknown or unappreciated roles critical to their broader ecosystems and to biodiversity.",39,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110375', 'afid': '60110375', 'affilname': 'Catalan Institute for Water Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Girona', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082291', 'afid': '60082291', 'affilname': 'The Fenner School of Environment &amp; Society', 'affiliation-city': 'Canberra', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030807', 'afid': '60030807', 'affilname': 'Universität Regensburg', 'affiliation-city': 'Regensburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027245', 'afid': '60027245', 'affilname': 'Universite Paul Sabatier Toulouse III', 'affiliation-city': 'Toulouse', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026910', 'afid': '60026910', 'affilname': 'Clark University', 'affiliation-city': 'Worcester', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024594', 'afid': '60024594', 'affilname': 'National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand', 'affiliation-city': 'Auckland', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020486', 'afid': '60020486', 'affilname': 'University of Bern', 'affiliation-city': 'Bern', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018805', 'afid': '60018805', 'affilname': 'Deakin University', 'affiliation-city': 'Geelong', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017383', 'afid': '60017383', 'affilname': 'Nature Conservancy', 'affiliation-city': 'Arlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015404', 'afid': '60015404', 'affilname': 'University of Denver', 'affiliation-city': 'Denver', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005686', 'afid': '60005686', 'affilname': 'University of Auckland', 'affiliation-city': 'Auckland', 'affiliation-country': 'New Zealand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000144', 'afid': '60000144', 'affilname': 'Bowdoin College', 'affiliation-city': 'Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hunter M.L.', 'Acuña V.', 'Bauer D.M.', 'Bell K.P.', 'Calhoun A.J.K.', 'Felipe-Lucia M.R.', 'Fitzsimons J.A.', 'González E.', 'Kinnison M.', 'Lindenmayer D.', 'Lundquist C.J.', 'Medellin R.A.', 'Nelson E.J.', 'Poschlod P.']","['35262167600', '23670461000', '7202230874', '7401917152', '7003355466', '55773643400', '7005451824', '7402466870', '7004032143', '35510108300', '7003846946', '6604067105', '56238505800', '6701449154']",Biodiversity | Ecosystem services | Keystone | Keystone species | Meso-filter,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320716310850,1313627

Vernal pools in the northeastern US are of conservation concern primarily because of their role as habitat for specialized pool-breeding amphibians, but their use by birds and mammals may also be of interest, especially from the perspective of the impact of urbanization. We describe camera-trapped wildlife (CTW) at 38 vernal pools along an urban development gradient in greater Bangor, Maine, USA. We detected 20 mammal and 39 bird taxa (29 contacted pool water; 39 detected at >1 site). Land cover type within 1000 m (%), within-pool vegetation (%), and amphibian egg mass numbers explained a substantial portion of the variance (40.8%) in CTW assemblage composition. Submerged vegetation within pools and cover by water and impervious surfaces within 1000 m of pools were key site characteristics defining assemblages. We scored the urban-affiliation of taxa and modeled the relationship between weighted assemblage scores for each site and impervious cover. Impervious cover within 1000 m of pools was positively (p < 0.01) related to site urban-affiliation scores. Use probability for red fox increased and snowshoe hare decreased with impervious cover at 1000 m. These results indicate that within-pool vegetation and land cover types at 1000 m influenced bird and mammal assemblages that used study pools and greater impervious cover at 100 and 1000 m was correlated with a shift in assemblages from being dominated by urban-avoider to urban-adapted species. We encourage land use planners and managers to consider the influence of land use practices within 1000 m of vernal pools on birds and mammals, especially near amphibian breeding pools.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Eakin C.', 'Hunter M.', 'Calhoun A.']","['57076207400', '35262167600', '7003355466']",Camera trap | Subsidized wildlife | Urban gradient | Urban wetlands | Urban wildlife | Vernal pool,NIFA,021705,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1313627

Sustainability science uses a transdisciplinary research process in which academic and non-academic partners collaborate to identify a common problem and co-produce knowledge to develop more sustainable solutions. Sustainability scientists have advanced the theory and practice of facilitating collaborative efforts such that the knowledge created is usable. There has been less emphasis, however, on the last step of the transdisciplinary process: enacting solutions. We analyzed a case study of a transdisciplinary research effort in which co-produced policy simulation information shaped the creation of a new policy mechanism. More specifically, by studying the development of a mechanism for conserving vernal pool ecosystems, we found that four factors helped overcome common challenges to acting upon new information: creating a culture of learning, co-producing policy simulations that acted as boundary objects, integrating research into solution development, and employing an adaptive management approach. With an increased focus on these four factors that enable action, we can better develop the same level of nuanced theoretical concepts currently characterizing the earlier phases of transdisciplinary research, and the practical advice for deliberately designing these efforts.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Levesque V.', 'Calhoun A.', 'Bell K.']","['55627782100', '7003355466', '7401917152']",Co-production | Collaboration | Knowledge to action | Land use policy | Transdisciplinary | Vernal pool,NIFA,ME0-031802,University of Maine,,1313627

Vernal pools are small, seasonal wetlands that are a common landscape feature contributing to biodiversity in northeastern North American forests. Basic information about their biogeochemical functions, such as carbon cycling, is limited. Concentrations of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and other water chemistry parameters were monitored weekly at the bottom and surface of four vernal pools in central and eastern Maine, USA, from April to August 2016. The vernal pools were supersaturated with respect to CH4 and CO2 at all sampling dates and locations. Concentrations of dissolved CH4 and CO2 ranged from 0.4 to 210 μmol L−1 and 72–2300 μmol L−1, respectively. Diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 into the atmosphere ranged from 0.2 to 73 mmol m−2 d−1, and 30–590 mmol m−2 d−1, respectively. During the study period, the four vernal pools emitted 0.1–5.8 kg C m−2 and 9.6–120 kg C m−2 as CH4 and CO2, respectively. The production fluxes (production rates normalized to surface area) of CH4 and CO2 ranged from − 0.02 to 0.66 and 0.40–4.6 g C m−2 d−1, respectively, and increased significantly over the season. Methane concentrations were best predicted by alkalinity, ortho-phosphate and depth, while CO2 concentrations were best predicted with only alkalinity. Alkalinity as a predictor variable highlights the importance of anaerobic respiration in production of both gases.

The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses.

Study conducted to know the nutritional composition, in vitro degradation and the potential fermentation of tree leaves species grazed by ruminants in secondary vegetation of a deciduous forest. Tree leaves were selected from 18 tree species that were subjected to in vitro fermentation. Fermentation variables were analyzed with a designed block repeated over time. The content of CP, NDF and ADF fluctuated among species, from 109 to 262, 391 to 641 and 322 to 579 g kg-1 of DM, respectively. The concentrations of condensed tannins (CT) presented a wide variation among species and ranged from 1.73 to 233.45 g kg-1 DM. The significant differences (P <0.05) observed among species in fermentation and digestibility. G. floribundum, M. lindeniana, V. gaumeri, H. barvensis, T. amygdalifolia and C. gaumeri had the highest gas volume (155 to 293.88 mL g-1), total fermentation (379.45 to 677.39 mg g-1), fermentation rate (0.031 to 0.038 h-1), and soluble fraction (178.3 to 265 g kg of DM-1). In addition, they had highest values of the rapid fermentation fractions (123.58 a 214.88 mg g-1), medium fermentation (37.07 to 217.87 mg g-1), and slow fermentation fractions (162.33 to 244.64 mg g-1), and the highest IVDMD values (39.71 to 54.93%) and IVOMD (47.96 to 66.50%).

Poorly planned, large-scale ecological restoration projects may displace agricultural activities and potentially lead to the clearance of native vegetation elsewhere, with associated impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet few studies have considered these risks and the ways in which restoration can increase competition for land. Here, we address this issue by examining whether large-scale restoration of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could displace cattle production, as a result of land shortages. Although the risks of displacement are indeed high when reforestation is planned in areas with high cattle productivity, we discuss how these risks can be minimized through a combination of productivity increases, a regional restoration planning framework, and the prioritization of marginal agricultural land for restoration. We also consider how restoration can, in some circumstances, be made more economically sustainable by incorporating income-generating activities such as exploitation of timber and non-timber forest products, certification, and payments for ecosystem services.",68,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032361', 'afid': '60032361', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008916', 'afid': '60008916', 'affilname': 'Politechnika Opolska', 'affiliation-city': 'Opole', 'affiliation-country': 'Poland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000112', 'afid': '60000112', 'affilname': 'University of East Anglia', 'affiliation-city': 'Norwich', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114344278', 'afid': '114344278', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100808118', 'afid': '100808118', 'affilname': 'Stockholm Heart Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Latawiec A.', 'Strassburg B.', 'Brancalion P.', 'Rodrigues R.', 'Gardner T.']","['23667962400', '35612631400', '21740850700', '7103188195', '8266898800']",,,2013-1571,Swedish Research Council Formas,,1313788

Restoration Ecology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Ecological Restoration. Tropical reforestation (TR) has been highlighted as an important intervention for climate change mitigation because of its carbon storage potential. TR can also play other frequently overlooked, but significant, roles in helping society and ecosystems adapt to climate variability and change. For example, reforestation can ameliorate climate-associated impacts of altered hydrological cycles in watersheds, protect coastal areas from increased storms, and provide habitat to reduce the probability of species' extinctions under a changing climate. Consequently, reforestation should be managed with both adaptation and mitigation objectives in mind, so as to maximize synergies among these diverse roles, and to avoid trade-offs in which the achievement of one goal is detrimental to another. Management of increased forest cover must also incorporate measures for reducing the direct and indirect impacts of changing climate on reforestation itself. Here we advocate a focus on ""climate-smart reforestation,"" defined as reforesting for climate change mitigation and adaptation, while ensuring that the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on reforestation are anticipated and minimized.",55,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119114', 'afid': '60119114', 'affilname': 'Center for International Forestry Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Lima', 'affiliation-country': 'Peru'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071928', 'afid': '60071928', 'affilname': 'CATIE - Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza', 'affiliation-city': 'Turrialba', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030162', 'afid': '60030162', 'affilname': 'Columbia University in the City of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026164', 'afid': '60026164', 'affilname': 'CIRAD Centre de Recherche de Montpellier', 'affiliation-city': 'Montpellier', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115436851', 'afid': '115436851', 'affilname': 'ICRAF', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Banos', 'affiliation-country': 'Philippines'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115436835', 'afid': '115436835', 'affilname': 'Mercer Environment Associates', 'affiliation-city': 'Sleaford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101745963', 'afid': '101745963', 'affilname': 'IUCN', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Locatelli B.', 'Catterall C.P.', 'Imbach P.', 'Kumar C.', 'Lasco R.', 'Marín-Spiotta E.', 'Mercer B.', 'Powers J.S.', 'Schwartz N.', 'Uriarte M.']","['8611587300', '7003414327', '35487814900', '57037968400', '6602686739', '23389637500', '57193113207', '7402498640', '56594470600', '7003676202']",Climate-smart | Ecosystem service | Forest | Impact | Livelihood | Resilience | Vulnerability | Water,,undefined,,,1313788

All rights reserved. Although forest succession has traditionally been approached as a deterministic process, successional trajectories of vegetation change vary widely, even among nearby stands with similar environmental conditions and disturbance histories. Here, we provide the first attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify predictability and uncertainty during succession based on the most extensive long-term datasets ever assembled for Neotropical forests. We develop a novel approach that integrates deterministic and stochastic components into different candidate models describing the dynamical interactions among three widely used and interrelated forest attributes - stem density, basal area, and species density. Within each of the seven study sites, successional trajectories were highly idiosyncratic, even when controlling for prior land use, environment, and initial conditions in these attributes. Plot factors were far more important than stand age in explaining successional trajectories. For each site, the best-fit model was able to capture the complete set of time series in certain attributes only when both the deterministic and stochastic components were set to similar magnitudes. Surprisingly, predictability of stem density, basal area, and species density did not show consistent trends across attributes, study sites, or land use history, and was independent of plot size and time series length. The model developed here represents the best approach, to date, for characterizing autogenic successional dynamics and demonstrates the low predictability of successional trajectories. These high levels of uncertainty suggest that the impacts of allogenic factors on rates of change during tropical forest succession are far more pervasive than previously thought, challenging the way ecologists view and investigate forest regeneration.",131,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071928', 'afid': '60071928', 'affilname': 'CATIE - Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza', 'affiliation-city': 'Turrialba', 'affiliation-country': 'Costa Rica'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033545', 'afid': '60033545', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidad Javeriana', 'affiliation-city': 'Bogota', 'affiliation-country': 'Colombia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030522', 'afid': '60030522', 'affilname': 'Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029159', 'afid': '60029159', 'affilname': 'Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Da Amazonia', 'affiliation-city': 'Manaus', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023020', 'afid': '60023020', 'affilname': 'Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona', 'affiliation-city': 'Barcelona', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017161', 'afid': '60017161', 'affilname': 'National University of Singapore', 'affiliation-city': 'Singapore City', 'affiliation-country': 'Singapore'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007566', 'afid': '60007566', 'affilname': 'Louisiana State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baton Rouge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115209656', 'afid': '115209656', 'affilname': 'Fundación Cedrela', 'affiliation-city': 'Bogota', 'affiliation-country': 'Colombia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Norden N.', 'Angarita H.A.', 'Bongers F.', 'Martínez-Ramos M.', 'Cerda I.G.D.L.', 'Van Breugel M.', 'Lebrija-Trejos E.', 'Meave J.A.', 'Vandermeer J.', 'Williamson G.B.', 'Finegan B.', 'Mesquita R.', 'Chazdon R.L.']","['24451229200', '56736802100', '7003843226', '56013675200', '56736558100', '15045862000', '26221848900', '6602394131', '7005181045', '55664060800', '7006935009', '7005556630', '6603743015']",Dynamical models | Predictability | Succession | Tropical secondary forests | Uncertainty,CONACYT,2002-C01-0597,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,,1313788

During the past century, humans converted extensive areas of tropical forest into cultivated lands. Three distinct processes, each predominant during a different historical period, have driven the destruction of the forests. This review describes each of these deforestation dynamics: natural resource degrading poverty traps that predominated during the colonial era, new land settlement schemes that prevailed for two decades after decolonization, and finally, financialized, large enterprise dynamics that have predominated during the past quarter century. Each dynamic has, over time, given rise to different opportunities for conservation. Peasants emigrated from the sites of the poverty traps, and regrowth began to cover these degraded landscapes. Smallholders in the new land settlement areas became better acquainted with tropical tree species and allowed some trees to recolonize their fields, creating silvopastoral and agroforested landscapes. The heads of large enterprises relied on credit to clear land, so government regulators found that they could curb corporate-led deforestation by restricting access to credit when landowners failed to comply with laws against forest clearing. These links between deforestation's dynamics during past eras and conservation policies during the present era illustrate how a historical understanding of tropical deforestation can provide the basis for effective conservation policies.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029503', 'afid': '60029503', 'affilname': 'School of Environmental and Biological Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,['Rudel T.'],['35280524100'],Colonization projects | Conservation policy | Financialization | Poverty traps | Tropical deforestation,,undefined,,,1313788

Yet forest recovery through succession has led to an expansion of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes (HMTLs). Secondary forests thus emerge as a potential repository for tropical biodiversity, and also as a source of essential ecosystem functions and services in HMTLs. Such critical roles are controversial, however, as they depend on successional, landscape and socio-economic dynamics, which can vary widely within and across landscapes and regions. Understanding the main drivers of successional pathways of disturbed tropical forests is critically needed for improving management, conservation, and restoration strategies. Here, we combine emerging knowledge from tropical forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to identify the main driving forces shaping successional pathways at different spatial scales. We also explore causal connections between land-use dynamics and the level of predictability of successional pathways, and examine potential implications of such connections to determine the importance of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation in HMTLs. We show that secondary succession (SS) in tropical landscapes is a multifactorial phenomenon affected by a myriad of forces operating at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SS is relatively fast and more predictable in recently modified landscapes and where well-preserved biodiversity-rich native forests are still present in the landscape. Yet the increasing variation in landscape spatial configuration and matrix heterogeneity in landscapes with intermediate levels of disturbance increases the uncertainty of successional pathways. In landscapes that have suffered extensive and intensive human disturbances, however, succession can be slow or arrested, with impoverished assemblages and reduced potential to deliver ecosystem functions and services. We conclude that: (i) succession must be examined using more comprehensive explanatory models, providing information about the forces affecting not only the presence but also the persistence of species and ecological groups, particularly of those taxa expected to be extirpated from HMTLs; (ii) SS research should integrate new aspects from forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to address accurately the potential of secondary forests to serve as biodiversity repositories; and (iii) secondary forest stands, as a dynamic component of HMTLs, must be incorporated as key elements of conservation planning; i.e. secondary forest stands must be actively managed (e.g. using assisted forest restoration) according to conservation goals at broad spatial scales.",159,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031482', 'afid': '60031482', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco', 'affiliation-city': 'Recife', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011324', 'afid': '60011324', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal da Paraiba', 'affiliation-city': 'Joao Pessoa', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115209656', 'afid': '115209656', 'affilname': 'Fundación Cedrela', 'affiliation-city': 'Bogota', 'affiliation-country': 'Colombia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Arroyo-Rodríguez V.', 'Melo F.P.L.', 'Martínez-Ramos M.', 'Bongers F.', 'Chazdon R.L.', 'Meave J.A.', 'Norden N.', 'Santos B.A.', 'Leal I.R.', 'Tabarelli M.']","['56002716800', '7005124694', '56013675200', '7003843226', '6603743015', '56851940800', '24451229200', '7006476950', '56218788400', '7004125728']",biodiversity conservation | ecosystem services | forest recovery | land-use transformation | landscape restoration | landscape structure,AWMF,CB-2009-01-128136,Andrew W.

Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km2 of land (28.1%of the total study area).Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forestmanagement, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-costmechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services.",149,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106365', 'afid': '60106365', 'affilname': 'Yale NUS College', 'affiliation-city': 'Singapore City', 'affiliation-country': 'Singapore'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60077378', 'afid': '60077378', 'affilname': 'Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia', 'affiliation-city': 'Tunja', 'affiliation-country': 'Colombia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071503', 'afid': '60071503', 'affilname': 'University of Puerto Rico', 'affiliation-city': 'San Juan', 'affiliation-country': 'Puerto Rico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60035240', 'afid': '60035240', 'affilname': 'World Agroforestry Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Nairobi', 'affiliation-country': 'Kenya'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031482', 'afid': '60031482', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco', 'affiliation-city': 'Recife', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030835', 'afid': '60030835', 'affilname': 'University of Alberta', 'affiliation-city': 'Edmonton', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030522', 'afid': '60030522', 'affilname': 'Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030162', 'afid': '60030162', 'affilname': 'Columbia University in the City of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030101', 'afid': '60030101', 'affilname': 'University of Regina', 'affiliation-city': 'Regina', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029616', 'afid': '60029616', 'affilname': 'Aarhus Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Aarhus', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029159', 'afid': '60029159', 'affilname': 'Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Da Amazonia', 'affiliation-city': 'Manaus', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028596', 'afid': '60028596', 'affilname': 'Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics -

We present a historical overview of forest concepts and definitions, linking these changes with distinct perspectives and management objectives. Policies dealing with a broad range of forest issues are often based on definitions created for the purpose of assessing global forest stocks, which do not distinguish between natural and planted forests or reforests, and which have not proved useful in assessing national and global rates of forest regrowth and restoration. Implementing and monitoring forest and landscape restoration requires additional approaches to defining and assessing forests that reveal the qualities and trajectories of forest patches in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape matrix. New technologies and participatory assessment of forest states and trajectories offer the potential to operationalize such definitions. Purpose-built and contextualized definitions are needed to support policies that successfully protect, sustain, and regrow forests at national and global scales. We provide a framework to illustrate how different management objectives drive the relative importance of different aspects of forest state, dynamics, and landscape context.",126,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069393', 'afid': '60069393', 'affilname': 'Center for International Forestry Research, West Java', 'affiliation-city': 'Bogor', 'affiliation-country': 'Indonesia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851', 'afid': '60026851', 'affilname': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014872', 'afid': '60014872', 'affilname': 'World Resources Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011474', 'afid': '60011474', 'affilname': 'Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi', 'affiliation-city': 'Belem', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106331957', 'afid': '106331957', 'affilname': 'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chazdon R.', 'Brancalion P.', 'Laestadius L.', 'Bennett-Curry A.', 'Buckingham K.', 'Kumar C.', 'Moll-Rocek J.', 'Vieira I.', 'Wilson S.']","['6603743015', '21740850700', '15132093400', '55793139100', '36699307800', '57037968400', '37036142700', '7003391442', '56848464100']",Deforestation | Forest assessment | Forest management | Landscape | Plantation | Reforestation | Restoration,,undefined,,,1313788

We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984–2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dutrieux L.', 'Jakovac C.', 'Latifah S.', 'Kooistra L.']","['55543273300', '56497945100', '57205446059', '6603894270']",Land trajectories | Land use history | Landsat | Segmentation | Slash and burn agriculture | Swidden agriculture | Time-series,FP7,283093,Seventh Framework Programme,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0303243415300647,1313788

Swidden cultivation is one of the most widespread agricultural systems in the tropics. Due to socio-economic changes, swiddens are either abandoned, substituted for other agricultural systems, or intensified. In the region of the middle Amazon river, Brazil, the high market demand for cassava flour (farinha) combined with land scarcity is inducing agricultural intensification. We define agricultural intensification as an increase in the frequency of swidden-fallow cycles and a decrease in the fallow period. In this study, we evaluate the consequences of agricultural intensification for management practices and swidden productivity in one of the main cassava producing areas of the Brazilian Amazon. We used ethnographic and biophysical surveys to characterize the current management practices and to evaluate the effect of repeated swidden-fallow cycles within a short fallow period regime on swidden size, weed infestation and life-form composition, weeding effort and cassava productivity. Our results show that with repeated swidden-fallow cycles cassava yield decreases, weed cover increases and weed composition changes from a tree-dominated to a graminoid-dominated community. Such changes in the weed community result in increased weeding effort, to which farmers respond by cultivating smaller swiddens. Therefore, the ongoing agricultural intensification leads to lower swidden productivity and household income without ensuing clear benefits for farmers. Limited access to fertilizers, herbicides and technical assistance combined with the market demand for a single product hinders adaptation. Broadening market opportunities and improving technical assistance to farmers could raise the diversification of production and sources of income and guarantee higher resilience to the system.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029159', 'afid': '60029159', 'affilname': 'Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Da Amazonia', 'affiliation-city': 'Manaus', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}]",Journal,Article,"['Jakovac C.', 'Peña-Claros M.', 'Mesquita R.', 'Bongers F.', 'Kuyper T.']","['56497945100', '6506552133', '7005556630', '7003843226', '55918277500']",Brazil | Cassava | Labor | Riverine Amazonia | Shifting cultivation | Weeds | Yield,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167880915301481,1313788

Journal of Ecology © 2015 British Ecological Society. Summary: Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed- to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the - many times overlooked - importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden cultivation systems.

Swidden cultivation is one of the most widespread agricultural systems in the tropics. Due to socio-economic changes, swiddens are either abandoned, substituted for other agricultural systems, or intensified. In the region of the middle Amazon river, Brazil, the high market demand for cassava flour (farinha) combined with land scarcity is inducing agricultural intensification. We define agricultural intensification as an increase in the frequency of swidden-fallow cycles and a decrease in the fallow period. In this study, we evaluate the consequences of agricultural intensification for management practices and swidden productivity in one of the main cassava producing areas of the Brazilian Amazon. We used ethnographic and biophysical surveys to characterize the current management practices and to evaluate the effect of repeated swidden-fallow cycles within a short fallow period regime on swidden size, weed infestation and life-form composition, weeding effort and cassava productivity. Our results show that with repeated swidden-fallow cycles cassava yield decreases, weed cover increases and weed composition changes from a tree-dominated to a graminoid-dominated community. Such changes in the weed community result in increased weeding effort, to which farmers respond by cultivating smaller swiddens. Therefore, the ongoing agricultural intensification leads to lower swidden productivity and household income without ensuing clear benefits for farmers. Limited access to fertilizers, herbicides and technical assistance combined with the market demand for a single product hinders adaptation. Broadening market opportunities and improving technical assistance to farmers could raise the diversification of production and sources of income and guarantee higher resilience to the system.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029159', 'afid': '60029159', 'affilname': 'Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Da Amazonia', 'affiliation-city': 'Manaus', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}]",Journal,Article,"['Jakovac C.', 'Peña-Claros M.', 'Mesquita R.', 'Bongers F.', 'Kuyper T.']","['56497945100', '6506552133', '7005556630', '7003843226', '55918277500']",Brazil | Cassava | Labor | Riverine Amazonia | Shifting cultivation | Weeds | Yield,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167880915301481,1313788

Restoration Ecology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Ecological Restoration. Tropical reforestation (TR) has been highlighted as an important intervention for climate change mitigation because of its carbon storage potential. TR can also play other frequently overlooked, but significant, roles in helping society and ecosystems adapt to climate variability and change. For example, reforestation can ameliorate climate-associated impacts of altered hydrological cycles in watersheds, protect coastal areas from increased storms, and provide habitat to reduce the probability of species' extinctions under a changing climate. Consequently, reforestation should be managed with both adaptation and mitigation objectives in mind, so as to maximize synergies among these diverse roles, and to avoid trade-offs in which the achievement of one goal is detrimental to another. Management of increased forest cover must also incorporate measures for reducing the direct and indirect impacts of changing climate on reforestation itself.

Shifting cultivation is a traditional agricultural practice in most tropical regions of the world and has the potential to provide for human livelihoods while hosting substantial biodiversity. Little is known about the resilience of shifting cultivation to increasing agricultural demands on the landscape or to unexpected disturbances. To investigate these issues, we develop a simple social-ecological model and implement it with literature-derived ecological parameters for six shifting cultivation landscapes from three continents. Analyzing the model with the tools of dynamical systems analysis, we show that such landscapes exhibit two stable states, one characterized by high forest cover and agricultural productivity, and another with much lower values of these traits. For some combinations of agricultural pressure and ecological parameters both of these states can potentially exist, and the actual state of the forest depends critically on its historic state. In many cases, the landscapes' 'ecological resilience', or amount of forest that could be destroyed without shifting out of the forested stability domain, declined substantially at lower levels of agricultural pressure than would lead to maximum productivity. A measure of 'engineering resilience', the recovery time from standardized disturbances, was independent of ecological resilience. These findings suggest that maximization of short-term agricultural output may have counterproductive impacts on the long-term productivity of shifting cultivation landscapes and the persistence of forested areas.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030294', 'afid': '60030294', 'affilname': 'Wroclaw University of Economics and Business', 'affiliation-city': 'Wroclaw', 'affiliation-country': 'Poland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027152', 'afid': '60027152', 'affilname': 'Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Uppsala', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019497', 'afid': '60019497', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg', 'affiliation-city': 'Laxenburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101832133', 'afid': '101832133', 'affilname': 'Centre for Systems Solutions', 'affiliation-city': 'Wroclaw', 'affiliation-country': 'Poland'}]",Journal,Article,"['Magnuszewski P.', 'Ostasiewicz K.', 'Chazdon R.', 'Salk C.', 'Pajak M.', 'Sendzimir J.', 'Andersson K.']","['6507067300', '57212884713', '6603743015', '10042581400', '57032201000', '55992753100', '7402136237']",,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1313788

Increases in tree cover have concentrated in nations with recent histories of extensive deforestation, humid climates, high crop yields, and small numbers of farm workers. The associations of expanded tree cover with high yields for cereal crops and small populations of cultivators suggests a dynamic, sometimes referred to as a forest transition, in which urbanization and industrialization promote a long-term expansion in tree cover on certain types of land. The association of tree cover gains with tree cover losses and humid climates suggests a second dynamic, a churning, treadmill-like production of wood products from lands subjected to recurring harvests of wood products followed by tree cover gains in the recently harvested areas. The forest transition dynamic suggests that many smallholders would allow tree cover to expand on their lands if payments for environmental services were available. The salience of the treadmill dynamic of tree cover losses followed by tree cover gains underscores the importance of questions about the implications of commercial tree monocultures for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and social justice.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113166892', 'afid': '113166892', 'affilname': 'CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Tucumán', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rudel T.', 'Sloan S.', 'Chazdon R.', 'Grau R.']","['35280524100', '24504004400', '6603743015', '56941539600']",Deforestation | Forest transition | Logging | Reforestation | Tropical forests,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837715301678,1313788

Background: Wetland loss is a global concern due to its enormous ecosystem services. Marshland, a typical natural wetland, which is concentrated in the Sanjiang Plain, has undergone dramatic loss in the last several decades. The spatiotemporal changes in marshland were studied based on Landsat images of the Sanjiang Plain from 1980 to 2016 with the land use maps in 1980, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016 using land use dynamic degree and landscape indices. The driving forces of marshland loss, including biophysical factors, socio-economic factors, and land management, were analyzed with boosted regression trees (BRTs) methods. Results: The area of marshland loss was 7372 km2, which accounted for 65.7% of the area of marshland in 1980; however, the paddy field area was expanded by 22,313 km2. The lost marshland was mainly converted to dry farmland (47.5%) and paddy field (47.2%) during 1980–2016. Both the landscape pattern of the study area and marshland became increasingly fragmented. The relatively important factors responsible for marshland loss were biophysical factors, socio-economic factors, and land management, which accounted for 65.2%, 25.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. The most important driving forces with high “relative influence” were “distance to river,” which accounted for 20.6% of the total variance explained. The “relative influence” of potential crop yield and ditch density reached 20.2% and 8.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Significant land use changes have occurred in the Sanjiang Plain over the past 37 years, with characteristics of rapid paddy field expansion and drastic marshland loss. Meanwhile, marshland fragmentation continued to increase. Reclamation was the main reason for the large-scale marshland loss. Biophysical factors influenced the decisions regarding the locations of marshland loss. Moreover, climate factors (i.e., average annual precipitation and average annual temperature) also played an important role in marshland loss. These results can provide helpful knowledge for understanding the patterns and reasons for marshland loss and protecting and managing strategies for wetlands restoration.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363', 'afid': '60027363', 'affilname': 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li Z.', 'Liu M.', 'Hu Y.', 'Xue Z.', 'Sui J.']","['57204218788', '35264494000', '7407119076', '35114191700', '57212491529']",Driving forces | Land use change | Marshland loss | The Sanjiang Plain,CAS,2016YFC0500401,Chinese Academy of Sciences,,1313788

Community-based tropical forest restoration projects, often promoted as a win-win solution for local communities and the environment, have increased dramatically in number in the past decade. Many such projects are underway in Andean cloud forests, which, given their extremely high biodiversity and history of extensive clearing, are understudied. This study investigates the effi cacy of community-based tree-planting projects to accelerate cloud forest recovery, as compared to unassisted natural regeneration. This study takes place in northwest Andean Ecuador, where the majority of the original, highly diverse cloud forests have been cleared, in fi ve communities that initiated tree-planting projects to restore forests in 2003. In 2011, we identifi ed tree species along transects in planted forests (n = 5), naturally regenerating forests (n = 5), and primary forests (n = 5). We also surveyed 120 households about their restoration methods, tree preferences, and forest uses. We found that tree diversity was higher in planted than in unplanted secondary forest, but both were less diverse than primary forests. Ordination analysis showed that all three forests had distinct species compositions, although planted forests shared more species with primary forests than did unplanted forests. Planted forests also contained more animal-dispersed species in both the planted canopy and in the unplanted, regenerating understory than unplanted forests, and contained the highest proportion of species with use value for local people. While restoring forest increased biodiversity and accelerated forest recovery, restored forests may also represent novel ecosystems that are distinct from the region ' s previous ecosystems and, given their usefulness to people, are likely to be more common in the future.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010365', 'afid': '60010365', 'affilname': 'The University of British Columbia', 'affiliation-city': 'Vancouver', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494', 'afid': '60002494', 'affilname': 'McGill University', 'affiliation-city': 'Montreal', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wilson S.', 'Rhemtulla J.']","['56848464100', '6504520281']",Andes | Biodiversity | Cloud forest | Community forestry | Forest use | Locally useful species | Novel forests | Reforestation | Restoration | Succession | Tropical forest | Watershed management,FQRNT,undefined,Fonds QuÃ©bÃ©cois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies,,1313788

We propose four principles to guide tree planting schemes focused on carbon storage and commercial forestry in the tropics in the context of FLR. These principles support activities and land uses that increase tree cover in human-modified landscapes, while also achieving positive socioecological outcomes at local scales, in an appropriate contextualization: (1) restoration interventions should enhance and diversify local livelihoods; (2) afforestation should not replace native tropical grasslands or savanna ecosystems; (3) reforestation approaches should promote landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity; and (4) residual carbon stocks should be quantitatively and qualitatively distinguished from newly established carbon stocks. The emerging global restoration movement and its growing international support provide strong momentum for increasing tree and forest cover in mosaic landscapes.

In this paper, we explore the potential application of an innovation approach to bridge the gap between knowledge and action in restoration. The most promising innovation strategy for restoration is the adaptation of solutions developed in other fields of activity, for which market forces have historically supported programs of research and development. However, innovations in restoration may not rely only on technological tools requiring high investments. Rather, there are many opportunities for making better use of the existing funds and for low-cost solutions if restoration science and practice are reframed and integrated. If research projects are conceived to promote a co-production of knowledge with end users, valuable solutions for restoration problems may arise without extra investments. For restoration practice, substantial advances in our capacity to revert degradation could be obtained by shifting the focus from plot-scale, expensive solutions to the promotion of natural regeneration in sites where it is ecologically viable and socioeconomically feasible. For capacity building, promising approaches include emulating other models of technology transfer, mainly those used in agriculture, and fostering the use of web-based solutions. For governance, we recommend the promotion of ""policy triggers"" and better use of technology to obtain and integrate information. Finally, multi-stakeholder coalitions may contribute by linking these different fields of restoration and promoting the co-creation of solutions in complex socio-ecological systems.

However, the ecological outcomes of passive restoration are traditionally regarded as uncertain. We evaluated technical and legal strategies for balancing economic costs and ecological outcomes of passive versus active restoration in agricultural landscapes. We focused in the case of Brazil, where we assessed the factors driving the proportion of land allocated to passive and active restoration in 42 programs covering 698,398 hectares of farms in the Atlantic Forest, Atlantic Forest/cerrado ecotone and Amazon; the ecological outcomes of passive and active restoration in 2955 monitoring plots placed in six restoration programs; and the legal framework developed by some Brazilian states to balance the different restoration approaches and comply with legal commitments. Active restoration had the highest proportion of land allocated to it (78.4%), followed by passive (14.2%) and mixed restoration (7.4%). Passive restoration was higher in the Amazon, in silviculture, and when remaining forest cover was over 50 percent. Overall, both restoration approaches showed high levels of variation in the ecological outcomes; nevertheless, passively restored areas had a smaller percentage canopy cover, lower species density, and less shrubs and trees (dbh > 5 cm). The studied legal frameworks considered land abandonment for up to 4 years before deciding on a restoration approach, to favor the use of passive restoration.

Because of altered species composition, abiotic conditions and landscape habitat mosaics, together with human interventions, these successional pathways differ from those seen in pre-clearing forests. However, representation of different functional life forms of plant (tree, vine, grass, herb and fern) and animal (frugivorous seed disperser, granivorous seed predator, seedling herbivore and carnivore) shows consistent global variation among areas of pasture, intact forest, and post-grassland regrowth. Biotic webs of interaction involve complex indirect influences and feedbacks, which can account for wide observed variation in regeneration trajectories over time. Important processes include: limitation of tree establishment by dense grasses; recruitment and growth of pioneer pasture trees (shading grasses and facilitating bird-assisted seed dispersal); and smothering of trees by vines. In these interactions, species’ functional roles are more important than their biogeographic origins. Case studies in eastern Australia show native rain forest plant species diversity in all life forms increasing over time when pioneer trees are non-native (e.g., Cinnamomum camphora, Solanum mauritianum), concurrent with decreased grass and fern cover and increased abundance of trees and vine tangles. The global literature shows both native and non-native species facilitating and inhibiting regeneration. However conservation goals are often targeted at removing non-native species. Achieving large-scale tropical forest restoration will require increased recognition of their multiple roles, and compromises about allocating resources to their removal.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032987', 'afid': '60032987', 'affilname': 'Griffith University', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}]",Journal,Review,['Catterall C.'],['7003414327'],alien | dispersal | functional group | rain forest | restoration | secondary forest | succession | trophic interaction,,undefined,,,1313788

Restoring forest to hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded land has become a centerpiece of international plans to sequester carbon and conserve biodiversity. Forest landscape restoration will require scaling up ecological knowledge of secondary succession from small-scale field studies to predict forest recovery rates in heterogeneous landscapes. However, ecological field studies reveal widely divergent times to forest recovery, in part due to landscape features that are difficult to replicate in empirical studies. Seed rain can determine reforestation rate and depends on landscape features that are beyond the scale of most field studies. We develop mathematical models to quantify how landscape configuration affects seed rain and forest regrowth in degraded patches. The models show how landscape features can alter the successional trajectories of otherwise identical patches, thus providing insight into why some empirical studies reveal a strong effect of seed rain on secondary succession, while others do not. We show that seed rain will strongly limit reforestation rate when patches are near a threshold for arrested succession, when positive feedbacks between tree canopy cover and seed rain occur during early succession, and when directed dispersal leads to between-patch interactions. In contrast, seed rain has weak effects on reforestation rate over a wide range of conditions, including when landscape-scale seed availability is either very high or very low. Our modeling framework incorporates growth and survival parameters that are commonly estimated in field studies of reforestation. We demonstrate how mathematical models can inform forest landscape restoration by allowing land managers to predict where natural regeneration will be sufficient to restore tree cover. Translating quantitative forecasts into spatially targeted interventions for forest landscape restoration could support target goals of restoring millions of hectares of degraded land and help mitigate global climate change.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959', 'afid': '60013959', 'affilname': 'University of Florida', 'affiliation-city': 'Gainesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000881', 'afid': '60000881', 'affilname': 'Chiang Mai University', 'affiliation-city': 'Chiang Mai', 'affiliation-country': 'Thailand'}]",Journal,Article,"['Caughlin T.', 'Elliott S.', 'Lichstein J.']","['35285537200', '7401666503', '55176002300']",animal seed dispersal | Bonn challenge | directed dispersal | forest dynamics model | forest landscape restoration | Lambert's W function | mathematical model | perfect plasticity approximation | secondary succession | seed addition | seed limitation | spatial model,NSF,1415297,National Science Foundation,,1313788

We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions.

In some cases, naturally regenerating forests are not comparable to the community structure of primary forests after many decades. However, direct comparison of the outcomes of tropical forest restoration and natural regeneration is hindered by differences in metrics of forest recovery, inconsistency in land use histories, and dissimilarities in experimental design. We present the results of a replicated reforestation experiment comparing natural regeneration and polyculture tree planting at multiple diversity levels (3, 6, 9, or 12 native tree species), with uniform land use history and initial edaphic conditions. We compare the recovery of basal area and floristic diversity in these treatments after 5 yr of succession. Total basal area was higher in planted plots than in naturally regenerating plots, but it but did not vary among the different planted diversity levels.

We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed.

Understanding the impacts of agricultural land uses (ALUs) on forest regeneration is critical for biodiversity conservation in HMLs. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that considers the availability of propagules and the environment prevailing after field abandonment as two major determinants of forest regeneration in HMLs. The framework proposes that regeneration potential decreases with size, duration and severity of agricultural disturbance, reducing propagule availability and creating ill-suited environmental conditions for regeneration. We used studies from Southern Mexico to assess this framework. First, we identify regeneration bottlenecks that trees face during transit from seed to follow-up life stages, using demographic analysis of dominant pioneer species in recently abandoned fields. Then, we explore effects of ALUs on forest regeneration at the field and landscape scales, addressing major legacies. Finally, we integrate agricultural disturbance with landscape composition to predict attributes of successful second growth forests in HMLs, and provide indicators useful to select tree native species for active restoration. An indicator of disturbance inflicted by ALUs, based on farmers’ information, predicted better regeneration potential than measurements of soil and microclimate conditions at time of abandonment. Cover of cattle pastures in the landscape was a stronger indicator of forest regenerating attributes than cover of old growth forest remnants.

Here, we present data on forest regeneration and animal abundance at four regenerating sites that had reached the stage of closed canopy forest where the average dbh of the trees was 17 cm. Overall, 20.3 percent of stems were wind-dispersed species and 79.7 percent were animal-dispersed species, while in the old-growth forest 17.3 percent of the stems were wind-dispersed species. The regenerating forest supported a substantial primate population and encounter rate (groups per km walked) in the regenerating sites was high compared to the neighboring old-growth forests. By monitoring elephant tracks for 10 yr, we demonstrated that elephant numbers increased steadily over time, but they increased dramatically since 2004. In general, the richness of the mammal community detected by sight, tracks, feces, and/or camera traps, was high in regenerating forests compared to that documented for the national park.

We propose that restored ecosystems have a temporal dimension that is variable, often finite, and likely predictable to some extent based on attributes of stakeholders, environment, and governance. The longevity of a restored ecosystem carries strong implications for its capacity to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, so an emerging challenge for restoration ecology is to predict the circumstances under which restored ecosystems persist for longer or shorter periods of time. We use a case study in tropical forest restoration to demonstrate one way that restored ecosystem longevity can be approached quantitatively, and we highlight opportunities for future research using restoration case study repositories, practitioner surveys, and historical aerial imagery.

Forests in the dry tropics differ significantly from forests in the humid tropics in their biomass and in their socio-ecological contexts, so it might be reasonable to assume that the dynamics that drive deforestation in these two settings would also differ. Until recently, difficulties in measuring the extent of dry tropical forests have made it difficult to investigate this claim empirically. The release of high resolution LANDSAT satellite imagery in 2013 has removed this impediment, making it possible to identify variations in the extent of wet and dry forests within countries by measuring variations in the canopy cover of their forests. These metrics have in turn made it possible to investigate human differences in the dynamics of deforestation between dry forested and wet forested nations in the tropics. Cross-national analyses suggest that international trade in agricultural commodities plays a more important role in driving deforestation in the wet tropics than it does in the dry tropics. The variable salience of international trade as a driver has important implications, described here, for the success of policies designed to slow deforestation in the dry tropics and the wet tropics. Curbing dry forest losses, in particular, would appear to require locally focused and administered policies.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,['Rudel T.'],['35280524100'],Dry tropical forests | Humid tropical forests | Tropical deforestation,,undefined,,,1313788

Increases in tree cover have concentrated in nations with recent histories of extensive deforestation, humid climates, high crop yields, and small numbers of farm workers. The associations of expanded tree cover with high yields for cereal crops and small populations of cultivators suggests a dynamic, sometimes referred to as a forest transition, in which urbanization and industrialization promote a long-term expansion in tree cover on certain types of land. The association of tree cover gains with tree cover losses and humid climates suggests a second dynamic, a churning, treadmill-like production of wood products from lands subjected to recurring harvests of wood products followed by tree cover gains in the recently harvested areas. The forest transition dynamic suggests that many smallholders would allow tree cover to expand on their lands if payments for environmental services were available. The salience of the treadmill dynamic of tree cover losses followed by tree cover gains underscores the importance of questions about the implications of commercial tree monocultures for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and social justice.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113166892', 'afid': '113166892', 'affilname': 'CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Tucumán', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rudel T.', 'Sloan S.', 'Chazdon R.', 'Grau R.']","['35280524100', '24504004400', '6603743015', '56941539600']",Deforestation | Forest transition | Logging | Reforestation | Tropical forests,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837715301678,1313788

Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits.

We compile data from 112 studies on the effects of natural climate variability, including warming, droughts, fires, and cyclonic storms, on demography and dynamics of second growth forest trees and identify variation in forest responses across biomes, regions, and landscapes. Across studies, drought decreases tree growth, survival, and recruitment, particularly during early succession, but the effects of temperature remain unexplored. Shifts in the frequency and severity of disturbance alter successional trajectories and increase the extent of second growth forests. Vulnerability to climate extremes is generally inversely related to long-term exposure, which varies with historical climate and biogeography. The majority of studies, however, have been conducted in the Neotropics hindering generalization. Effects of fire and cyclonic storms often lead to positive feedbacks, increasing vulnerability to climate extremes and subsequent disturbance. Fragmentation increases forests’ vulnerability to fires, wind, and drought, while land use and other human activities influence the frequency and intensity of fire, potentially retarding succession. Comparative studies of climate effects on tropical forest succession across biogeographic regions are required to forecast the response of tropical forest landscapes to future climates and to implement effective FLR policies and programs in these landscapes.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030162', 'afid': '60030162', 'affilname': 'Columbia University in the City of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Uriarte M.', 'Schwartz N.', 'Powers J.S.', 'Marín-Spiotta E.', 'Liao W.', 'Werden L.K.']","['7003676202', '56594470600', '7402498640', '23389637500', '57191675987', '24451431600']",Drought | fire | hurricanes | regrowth forests | warming,EMS,EF Macrosystems 1137239,EMS Ingénierie,,1313788

A core reason for such gaps is that researchers, practitioners, and policy makers lack the structured space to interact and collaborate, which is essential for effective, interdisciplinary research, practice, and evaluation. Thus, scientific findings, policy recommendations, and measured outcomes have not always been synthesized into deep, systemic understanding; learning from practice and implementation does not easily find its way into scientific analyses, and science often fails to influence policy. Communities of practice (CofPs) are dynamic sociocultural systems that bring people together to share and create knowledge around a common topic of interest. They offer participants a space and structure within which to develop new, systemic approaches to multidimensional problems on a common theme. Uniquely informed by a systems-thinking perspective and drawing from the scientific and gray literatures and in-depth interviews with representatives of established CofPs in the natural resource management and development domain, we argue that a well-designed and adequately funded CofP can facilitate interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral relationships and knowledge exchange. Well-designed CofPs integrate a set of core features and processes to enhance individual, collective, and domain outcomes; they set out an initial but evolving purpose, encourage diverse leadership, and promote collective-identity development. Funding facilitates effective communication strategies (e.g., in person meetings).

Compared to other competing land uses (agriculture, pasture, and even other tree-based systems such as plantations) the benefits of restoration are often dispersed, less obvious, unproven in the local context, and require large areas to be realized, making restoration risky or difficult for an individual landholder. This study in the Ecuadorian Andes showed that introducing communally owned and managed reserves created a space for people to learn about the practice and benefits of planting trees. Because communal reserves provided a relatively low-risk, low-cost environment to restore forests, key barriers to participation were lifted. In the process, farmers learned about tree planting and its benefits, knowledge they could (and did) apply on private farms. Introducing communal land-tenure thus changed local norms and practices around forest cultivation and clearing, and produced diverse forests across the landscape.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,['Wilson S.'],['56848464100'],,FQRNT,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2452292916301485,1313788

In light of recent commitments to mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity, international organizations are calling for vast areas of land to be restored over the next few decades. At the landscape level, for restoration to be adopted and sustained, it must be attractive to multiple stakeholders with diverse goals that unfold over different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, restoring forest landscapes inherently involves interactions between many levels and types of organizations, institutions, and stakeholders. As a global paradigm, FLR is a relatively new idea, and governance structures required to facilitate and sustain it over time are not obvious. But fortunately, examples of successfully governing FLR can be found in different contexts around the world, with lessons for restoration efforts elsewhere. In this paper, we summarize the differences and similarities between FLR and previous interventions (ecological restoration, forest conservation, and so on) and the specific governance challenges it presents. We then provide an overview of case reports illustrating innovative governance structures that have contributed to successful FLR, presented in this special issue in the journal World Development Perspectives. Cases at the local, national, and multinational levels include new governance institutions or arrangements that have supported landscape restoration in a given context, and the innovative use of existing governance structures to produce landscape-level forest restoration. Collectively, these cases demonstrate that successful governance approaches should be people-centered, adaptable to local contexts and needs, engage a range of stakeholders across different scales and sectors, and be flexible to incorporate local practices and ideas, and changes in these over time. Cases present a range of models and techniques for fostering these conditions, and acheiving forest restoration at the landscape scale.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031195', 'afid': '60031195', 'affilname': 'International Rice Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Makati', 'affiliation-country': 'Philippines'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wilson S.', 'Cagalanan D.']","['56848464100', '55938465500']",Community-based forest management | Ecological restoration | Forest conservation | Forest landscape restoration | Governance | Natural resource management,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2452292916301710,1313788

But the challenge to recover economic and ecological functionality could be far beyond their financial capacity. Here, we explore the potential of markets and their interaction with policies to leverage investment for FLR in the tropics. We first review the challenges and opportunities of exploiting market forces for FLR, which can be essential for kick-starting the implementation of programs globally. We identify four key opportunities for regulating markets to promote FLR: economic mechanisms; technological, educational or infrastructural investment; legal and enforcement mechanisms; and market-led standards and certification schemes. Finally, we present five pitfalls that may arise when relying on markets to promote FLR. Governments will need to play a critical role in establishing appropriate policy frameworks and institutional arrangements to leverage investments when market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in traditional land use or farming practices, or to regulate reforestation activities when market signals become so strong that they overwhelm all other land-use activities, leading to a transformed and homogenized landscape.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60077597', 'afid': '60077597', 'affilname': 'Union of Concerned Scientists', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032607', 'afid': '60032607', 'affilname': 'University of the Sunshine Coast', 'affiliation-city': 'Sippy Downs', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032361', 'afid': '60032361', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881', 'afid': '60001881', 'affilname': 'University of Sheffield', 'affiliation-city': 'Sheffield', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113353982', 'afid': '113353982', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Review,"['Brancalion P.', 'Lamb D.', 'Ceccon E.', 'Boucher D.', 'Herbohn J.', 'Strassburg B.', 'Edwards D.']","['21740850700', '56017151900', '56388611800', '57204401015', '6603005931', '35612631400', '7404087101']",Ecological economics | Ecosystem services | Forest governance | Large-scale restoration | Tropical forest restoration | Tropical reforestation | Wood production,CNPq,304817/2015-5,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1389934116304580,1313788

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Assessing the conservation value of restoration plantings is critical to support the global forest landscape restoration movement. We assessed the implications of tree species selection in the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest regarding carbon stocking and species conservation. This assessment was based on a comprehensive dataset of seedling acquisition records from 961 restoration projects, more than14 million seedlings, 192 forest remnants, and functional data from 1,223 tree species. We found that animal-dispersed trees with larger seeds tend to have higher seed prices, yet are underrepresented in the seedlings acquired for restoration plantations. Compared to forest remnants, fruit supply potentially offered by the species acquired for restoration plantings is lower for birds, but higher for bats. Reduced abundance of medium- and/or large-seeded, animal-dispersed trees lead to declines of 2.8–10.6% in simulated potential carbon stocking. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, policy interventions may be needed to encourage greater representation of large-seeded, animal-dispersed tree species in Atlantic Forest restorations. These findings provide critical guidance for recovering tree functional diversity, plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions, and carbon stocking in multi-species tropical forest restoration plantings.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006627', 'afid': '60006627', 'affilname': 'CSIC- Estación Biológica de Doñana EBD', 'affiliation-city': 'Sevilla', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006028', 'afid': '60006028', 'affilname': 'UNESP-Universidade Estadual Paulista', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001319', 'afid': '60001319', 'affilname': 'Missouri Botanical Garden', 'affiliation-city': 'St. Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121115325', 'afid': '121115325', 'affilname': 'Centro de Experimentos Florestais', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113353982', 'afid': '113353982', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Brancalion P.', 'Bello C.', 'Chazdon R.', 'Galetti M.', 'Jordano P.', 'Lima R.', 'Medina A.', 'Pizo M.', 'Reid J.']","['21740850700', '56707047000', '6603743015', '7004205870', '6701660089', '15836906900', '57201682532', '6602776865', '55388476000']",forest nurseries | keystone species | mutualistic interactions | restoration monitoring | restoration plantations | seed dispersal | seed size | seedling production | species reintroduction,CNPq,2013/22492-2,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,,1313788

Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Our meta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56% and 19 to 56% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.",77,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082291', 'afid': '60082291', 'affilname': 'The Fenner School of Environment &amp; Society', 'affiliation-city': 'Canberra', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032607', 'afid': '60032607', 'affilname': 'University of the Sunshine Coast', 'affiliation-city': 'Sippy Downs', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032361', 'afid': '60032361', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027947', 'afid': '60027947', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Seropedica', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017750', 'afid': '60017750', 'affilname': 'Uniwersytet Rolniczy im.

During forest succession, aboveground biomass stocks and litter fluxes increase in a predictable way, but patterns in soil C dynamics are highly variable. The heterogeneous response of nutrients to reforestation is influenced by multiple factors, including losses incurred during prior land use and management. In contrast to primary tropical forests, where productivity is often limited by rock-derived nutrients, secondary forest growth may be more limited by nutrients from the atmosphere. Future research should identify which nutrients constrain forest regrowth.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Book Series,Article,"['Powers J.S.', 'Marín-Spiotta E.']","['7402498640', '23389637500']",Biogeochemistry | Nutrient cycling | Reforestation | Regeneration | Tropics,NSF,1349952,National Science Foundation,,1313788

Several recent meta-analyses have aimed to determine whether natural regeneration is more effective at recovering tropical forests than active restoration (for example, tree planting). We reviewed this literature and found that comparisons between strategies are biased by positive site selection. Studies of natural forest regeneration are generally conducted at sites where a secondary forest was already present, whereas tree planting studies are done in a broad range of site conditions, including non-forested sites that may not have regenerated in the absence of planting. Thus, a level of success in forest regeneration is guaranteed for many studies representing natural regeneration, but not for those representing active restoration. The complexity of optimizing forest restoration is best addressed by paired experimentation at the same site, replicated across landscapes. Studies that have taken this approach reach different conclusions than those arising from meta-analyses; the results of paired experimental comparisons emphasize that natural regeneration is a highly variable process and that active restoration and natural regeneration are complementary strategies.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024997', 'afid': '60024997', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland, Baltimore County', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013791', 'afid': '60013791', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001319', 'afid': '60001319', 'affilname': 'Missouri Botanical Garden', 'affiliation-city': 'St. Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Reid J.', 'Fagan M.', 'Zahawi R.']","['55388476000', '53871259200', '8325186800']",,,undefined,,,1313788

We propose that restored ecosystems have a temporal dimension that is variable, often finite, and likely predictable to some extent based on attributes of stakeholders, environment, and governance. The longevity of a restored ecosystem carries strong implications for its capacity to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, so an emerging challenge for restoration ecology is to predict the circumstances under which restored ecosystems persist for longer or shorter periods of time. We use a case study in tropical forest restoration to demonstrate one way that restored ecosystem longevity can be approached quantitatively, and we highlight opportunities for future research using restoration case study repositories, practitioner surveys, and historical aerial imagery.

Clouded titles to land in remote rural areas of the Global South have recently prevented increases in agricultural productivity and payments for environmental services (PES), so making land tenure more secure has become a priority for policymakers. The historical dynamics surrounding land tenure transitions suggest a strategy for reform. Colonial regimes stripped indigenous peoples of most rights to land. Newly independent states restored these rights for some smallholders through land reforms. Later, neo-liberal regimes made secure titles more expensive, and, in so doing, made insecure land tenure more pervasive. Spots of secure land tenure did emerge when indigenous groups, with outside support, resisted efforts by powerful outsiders to expropriate indigenous homelands. Because insecure land tenure persists in most forested rural areas, a focus on afforestation in deforested areas, where earlier episodes of reform secured smallholder land tenure, offers a promising direction for future PES and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) efforts.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Book Series,Review,"['Rudel T.K.', 'Hernandez M.']","['35280524100', '57196075067']",Dualism | Land tenure | Neo-patrimonial states | PES | REDD+ | Rural,,undefined,,,1313788

New forests are expanding around the world. In many regions, regrowth rates are surpassing deforestation rates, resulting in “forest transitions,” or net gains in forest cover. Typically measured only in terms of aggregate“’forest cover” change, these new forests are ecologically distinct from each other and from those originally cleared. We ask, what are the ecological attributes, goods, and services we might expect from different pathways of forest recovery? To address this question, we proposed a typology of forest transitions that reflects both their social drivers and ecological outcomes: tree plantation, spontaneous regeneration, and agroforestry transitions. Using case studies, we illustrate how the ecological outcomes of each transition type differ and change over time. We mapped the global distribution of forest-transition types to identify global epicenters of each, and found that spontaneous transitions are most common globally, especially in Latin America; agroforestry transitions predominate in Europe and Central America; and plantation transitions occur in parts of Europe and Asia. We proposed a conceptual framework to understand and compare the ecological services arising from different types of forest transitions over time: forest ecosystem-service transition curves. This framework illustrates that carbon sequestration tends to be comparatively lower in agroforestry transitions, and biodiversity recovery is lower in industrial plantations. Spontaneously regenerating forests tend to have relatively high biodiversity and biomass but provide fewer provisioning and economically valuable services. This framework captures the dynamism that we observe in forest transitions, thus illustrating that different social drivers produce different types of ecosystem-service transitions, and that as secondary forests grow, these services will change over time at rates that differ among transition types. Ultimately, this framework can guide future research, describe actual and potential changes in ecosystem services associated with different types of transitions, and promote management plans that incorporate forest cover changes with the services and benefits they provide.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003933', 'afid': '60003933', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (UNT)', 'affiliation-city': 'San Miguel de Tucuman', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120299412', 'afid': '120299412', 'affilname': 'Instituto de Ecología Regional', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120298839', 'afid': '120298839', 'affilname': 'PARTNERS Reforestation Network', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112515764', 'afid': '112515764', 'affilname': 'CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Tucumán', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106929531', 'afid': '106929531', 'affilname': 'Southern Research Station', 'affiliation-city': 'Asheville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wilson S.J.', 'Schelhas J.', 'Grau R.', 'Nanni A.S.', 'Sloan S.']","['56848464100', '6602484071', '56941539600', '56091357600', '24504004400']",Biodiversity | Carbon | Ecosystem services | Forest conservation | Forest cover change | Forest transition | Land use change | Plantations | Secondary forest,,7College,,,1313788

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2019 British Ecological Society International forest landscape restoration commitments have promoted the restoration of millions of hectares of degraded and deforested lands globally, but few forest restoration approaches provide both ecologically-sound and financially-viable solutions for achieving the spatial scale proposed. One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset 44%–75% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113353982', 'afid': '113353982', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Brancalion P.H.S.', 'Amazonas N.T.', 'Chazdon R.L.', 'van Melis J.', 'Rodrigues R.R.', 'Silva C.C.', 'Sorrini T.B.', 'Holl K.D.']","['21740850700', '44060944900', '6603743015', '36661444200', '7103188195', '57201281631', '57211460465', '7006134584']",Atlantic forest | ecological restoration | Eucalyptus | forest and landscape restoration | large-scale restoration | natural regeneration | restoration costs | restoration economy,CNPq,304817/2015‐5,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,,1313788

Restoration interventions aim to increase functionality and resilience of landscapes, conserve biodiversity, store carbon, and mitigate effects of global climate change. We propose four principles to guide tree planting schemes focused on carbon storage and commercial forestry in the tropics in the context of FLR. These principles support activities and land uses that increase tree cover in human-modified landscapes, while also achieving positive socioecological outcomes at local scales, in an appropriate contextualization: (1) restoration interventions should enhance and diversify local livelihoods; (2) afforestation should not replace native tropical grasslands or savanna ecosystems; (3) reforestation approaches should promote landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity; and (4) residual carbon stocks should be quantitatively and qualitatively distinguished from newly established carbon stocks. The emerging global restoration movement and its growing international support provide strong momentum for increasing tree and forest cover in mosaic landscapes.

We focused in the case of Brazil, where we assessed the factors driving the proportion of land allocated to passive and active restoration in 42 programs covering 698,398 hectares of farms in the Atlantic Forest, Atlantic Forest/cerrado ecotone and Amazon; the ecological outcomes of passive and active restoration in 2955 monitoring plots placed in six restoration programs; and the legal framework developed by some Brazilian states to balance the different restoration approaches and comply with legal commitments. Active restoration had the highest proportion of land allocated to it (78.4%), followed by passive (14.2%) and mixed restoration (7.4%). Passive restoration was higher in the Amazon, in silviculture, and when remaining forest cover was over 50 percent. Overall, both restoration approaches showed high levels of variation in the ecological outcomes; nevertheless, passively restored areas had a smaller percentage canopy cover, lower species density, and less shrubs and trees (dbh > 5 cm).

Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests.

We present a historical overview of forest concepts and definitions, linking these changes with distinct perspectives and management objectives. Policies dealing with a broad range of forest issues are often based on definitions created for the purpose of assessing global forest stocks, which do not distinguish between natural and planted forests or reforests, and which have not proved useful in assessing national and global rates of forest regrowth and restoration. Implementing and monitoring forest and landscape restoration requires additional approaches to defining and assessing forests that reveal the qualities and trajectories of forest patches in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape matrix. New technologies and participatory assessment of forest states and trajectories offer the potential to operationalize such definitions. Purpose-built and contextualized definitions are needed to support policies that successfully protect, sustain, and regrow forests at national and global scales. We provide a framework to illustrate how different management objectives drive the relative importance of different aspects of forest state, dynamics, and landscape context.",126,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069393', 'afid': '60069393', 'affilname': 'Center for International Forestry Research, West Java', 'affiliation-city': 'Bogor', 'affiliation-country': 'Indonesia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851', 'afid': '60026851', 'affilname': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014872', 'afid': '60014872', 'affilname': 'World Resources Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011474', 'afid': '60011474', 'affilname': 'Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi', 'affiliation-city': 'Belem', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106331957', 'afid': '106331957', 'affilname': 'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chazdon R.', 'Brancalion P.', 'Laestadius L.', 'Bennett-Curry A.', 'Buckingham K.', 'Kumar C.', 'Moll-Rocek J.', 'Vieira I.', 'Wilson S.']","['6603743015', '21740850700', '15132093400', '55793139100', '36699307800', '57037968400', '37036142700', '7003391442', '56848464100']",Deforestation | Forest assessment | Forest management | Landscape | Plantation | Reforestation | Restoration,,undefined,,,1313788

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. The global restoration movement is gaining momentum. International and national leaders are demonstrating unparalleled political will for achieving ambitious targets. However, the knowledge base for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration (FLR) needs further development. Besides application of scientific and local knowledge, a broad understanding of the social, economic, and environmental context in which this knowledge is being applied is also needed. To address knowledge gaps and guide implementation of FLR at local to global scales we propose a knowledge creation agenda that we derive from emerging policy goals. We present a holistic approach that addresses food security, ecosystem services, and livelihoods, and that supports implementation by a wide array of actors from farmers and municipalities to corporations and state agencies. Our knowledge creation agenda is based on six broad policy goals, with several associated knowledge gaps for each goal. We recognize that this agenda is simply a starting point and will surely evolve and become more locally focused as the concept of FLR gains ground and as multiple groups of stakeholders engage in the long-term process of restoring functionality and value to ecosystems and landscapes around the world.",110,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014872', 'afid': '60014872', 'affilname': 'World Resources Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106331957', 'afid': '106331957', 'affilname': 'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chazdon R.', 'Brancalion P.', 'Lamb D.', 'Laestadius L.', 'Calmon M.', 'Kumar C.']","['6603743015', '21740850700', '56017151900', '15132093400', '45760918300', '57037968400']",Aichi biodiversity targets | Bonn challenge | ecological restoration | environmental policy | large-scale restoration | multidisciplinary research | New York Declaration on Forests | restoration governance | restoration planning | science-policy interface,,DEB-1313788,,,1313788

To achieve these ambitious goals, restoration decision makers need guiding principles regarding how to invest limited resources for large-scale forest restoration. Research over the past two decades has shown that a host of abiotic and biotic factors can slow tropical forest recovery, but that the specific barriers to and rate of recovery are site specific. Hence, restoration strategies must be carefully selected considering the natural resilience of a given site, localized barriers to recovery, and the ecological and human goals of the project. Despite the substantial advances in our understanding of tropical forest regeneration and restoration, to date neither the scale of scientific studies nor the restoration projects being implemented have matched the ambitious forest landscape restoration plans that are being proposed. I discuss key ways to enhance the success of tropical forest restoration efforts, citing a range of examples to illustrate each point. Specifically, restoration projects need to be planned and evaluated at larger spatial scales and over longer time periods, which requires better integration of the science and practice of forest restoration. Ultimately, forest restoration success hinges on including multiple stakeholders, such as farmers, local communities, local government leaders, regional and national policymakers, and scientists, in the planning, implementation, and evaluation processes. Finally, efforts to improve knowledge sharing across restoration projects in different regions will enhance the likelihood of implementing successful tropical forest restoration projects at the desired scale.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,['Holl K.'],['7006134584'],Forest landscape restoration | natural regeneration | seed dispersal | seedling gestablishment | tropical forest succession,,undefined,,,1313788

We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032361', 'afid': '60032361', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027947', 'afid': '60027947', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Seropedica', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017750', 'afid': '60017750', 'affilname': 'Uniwersytet Rolniczy im.

Understanding the impacts of agricultural land uses (ALUs) on forest regeneration is critical for biodiversity conservation in HMLs. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that considers the availability of propagules and the environment prevailing after field abandonment as two major determinants of forest regeneration in HMLs. The framework proposes that regeneration potential decreases with size, duration and severity of agricultural disturbance, reducing propagule availability and creating ill-suited environmental conditions for regeneration. We used studies from Southern Mexico to assess this framework. First, we identify regeneration bottlenecks that trees face during transit from seed to follow-up life stages, using demographic analysis of dominant pioneer species in recently abandoned fields. Then, we explore effects of ALUs on forest regeneration at the field and landscape scales, addressing major legacies. Finally, we integrate agricultural disturbance with landscape composition to predict attributes of successful second growth forests in HMLs, and provide indicators useful to select tree native species for active restoration. An indicator of disturbance inflicted by ALUs, based on farmers’ information, predicted better regeneration potential than measurements of soil and microclimate conditions at time of abandonment. Cover of cattle pastures in the landscape was a stronger indicator of forest regenerating attributes than cover of old growth forest remnants. To conclude, we offer recommendations to promote forest regeneration and biodiversity conservation in HMLs.",30,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004156', 'afid': '60004156', 'affilname': 'Wageningen University and Research Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Wageningen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}]",Journal,Review,"['Martínez-Ramos M.', 'Pingarroni A.', 'Rodríguez-Velázquez J.', 'Toledo-Chelala L.', 'Zermeño-Hernández I.', 'Bongers F.']","['56013675200', '57189870231', '6507748012', '57192008769', '56013352000', '7003843226']",agricultural land uses | dispersal limitation | establishment limitation | Mexico | second growth forests | secondary succession | tree demography | tropical rain forest,NSF,DEB-147429,National Science Foundation,,1313788

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society Achieving global targets for forest restoration will require cost-effective strategies to return agricultural land to forest, while minimizing implementation costs and negative outcomes for agricultural production. We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed approaches. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario produced the greatest savings (20.9%) in mechanized agricultural landscapes. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction scenario led to the highest savings (38.4%) in the landscape with highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness.

The regional contexts defining such reforestation have not been well described. They are likely to differ significantly from the geographical profiles outlined by site-specific observations that predominate in the literature. In response, this article determines the distribution, extent, and defining contexts of apparently spontaneous reforestation. It delineates regional ‘hotspots’ of significant net reforestation across Latin America and the Caribbean and defines a typology of these hotspots with reference to the biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics that unite and distinguish amongst them. Fifteen regional hotspots were identified on the basis of spatial criteria pertaining to the area, distribution, and rate of reforestation 2001–2014, observed using a custom continental MODIS satellite land-cover classification. Collectively, these hotspots cover 11% of Latin America and the Caribbean and they include 167,667.7 km2 of new forests. Comparisons with other remotely sensed estimates of reforestation indicate that these hotspots contain a significant amount of tropical reforestation, continentally and pantropically. The extent of reforestation as a proportion of its hotspot was relatively invariable (3–14%) given large disparities in hotspot areas and contexts. An ordination analysis defined a typology of five clusters, distinguished largely by their topographical roughness and related aspects of agro-ecological marginality, climate, population trends, and degree of urbanization: ‘Urban lowlands’ ‘Mountainous populated areas’ ‘Rural highlands’ ‘Rural humid lands’ and ‘Rural dry lands’. The typology highlights that a range of distinct, even oppositional regional biophysical, demographic, and agricultural contexts have equally given rise to significant, regional net reforestation, urging a concomitant diversification of forest transition science.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071503', 'afid': '60071503', 'affilname': 'University of Puerto Rico', 'affiliation-city': 'San Juan', 'affiliation-country': 'Puerto Rico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003933', 'afid': '60003933', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (UNT)', 'affiliation-city': 'San Miguel de Tucuman', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881', 'afid': '60001881', 'affilname': 'University of Sheffield', 'affiliation-city': 'Sheffield', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}]",Journal,Article,"['Nanni A.', 'Sloan S.', 'Aide T.', 'Graesser J.', 'Edwards D.', 'Grau H.']","['56091357600', '24504004400', '7004375740', '36632178200', '7404087101', '35619471400']",Hotspots | Latin America and the Caribbean | Reforestation | Regional contexts,NSF,PICT 2015-0521,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0959378018302255,1313788

For deforested lands to have conservation value requires an understanding of regeneration rates of vegetation, the rates at which animals colonize and grow in regenerating areas, and the nature of interactions between plants and animals in the specific region. Here, we present data on forest regeneration and animal abundance at four regenerating sites that had reached the stage of closed canopy forest where the average dbh of the trees was 17 cm. Overall, 20.3 percent of stems were wind-dispersed species and 79.7 percent were animal-dispersed species, while in the old-growth forest 17.3 percent of the stems were wind-dispersed species. The regenerating forest supported a substantial primate population and encounter rate (groups per km walked) in the regenerating sites was high compared to the neighboring old-growth forests. By monitoring elephant tracks for 10 yr, we demonstrated that elephant numbers increased steadily over time, but they increased dramatically since 2004.

We propose that restored ecosystems have a temporal dimension that is variable, often finite, and likely predictable to some extent based on attributes of stakeholders, environment, and governance. The longevity of a restored ecosystem carries strong implications for its capacity to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, so an emerging challenge for restoration ecology is to predict the circumstances under which restored ecosystems persist for longer or shorter periods of time. We use a case study in tropical forest restoration to demonstrate one way that restored ecosystem longevity can be approached quantitatively, and we highlight opportunities for future research using restoration case study repositories, practitioner surveys, and historical aerial imagery.

We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m², their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies.

However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032361', 'afid': '60032361', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027947', 'afid': '60027947', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Seropedica', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019497', 'afid': '60019497', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg', 'affiliation-city': 'Laxenburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017750', 'afid': '60017750', 'affilname': 'Uniwersytet Rolniczy im.

Natural regeneration offers a cost-effective way to achieve large-scale FLR, but is often overlooked in favor of tree plantations. The studies presented in this special issue show how natural regeneration can become an important part of FLR and highlight the ecological, environmental, and social factors that must be considered to effectively do so. They also identify major knowledge gaps and outline a research agenda to support the use of natural regeneration in FLR. Six central questions emerge from these studies: (1) What are the ecological, economic, and livelihood outcomes of active and passive restoration interventions?; (2) What are the tradeoffs and synergies among ecological, economic, and livelihood outcomes of natural regeneration, restoration and productive land uses, and how do they evolve in the face of market and climate shocks?; (3) What diagnostic tools are needed to identify and map target areas for natural regeneration?; (4) How should spatial prioritization frameworks incorporate natural regeneration into FLR?; (5) What legal frameworks and governance structures are best suited to encourage natural regeneration and how do they change across regions and landscapes?; (6) What financial mechanisms can foster low-cost natural regeneration?

In light of recent commitments to mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity, international organizations are calling for vast areas of land to be restored over the next few decades. At the landscape level, for restoration to be adopted and sustained, it must be attractive to multiple stakeholders with diverse goals that unfold over different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, restoring forest landscapes inherently involves interactions between many levels and types of organizations, institutions, and stakeholders. As a global paradigm, FLR is a relatively new idea, and governance structures required to facilitate and sustain it over time are not obvious. But fortunately, examples of successfully governing FLR can be found in different contexts around the world, with lessons for restoration efforts elsewhere. In this paper, we summarize the differences and similarities between FLR and previous interventions (ecological restoration, forest conservation, and so on) and the specific governance challenges it presents. We then provide an overview of case reports illustrating innovative governance structures that have contributed to successful FLR, presented in this special issue in the journal World Development Perspectives. Cases at the local, national, and multinational levels include new governance institutions or arrangements that have supported landscape restoration in a given context, and the innovative use of existing governance structures to produce landscape-level forest restoration. Collectively, these cases demonstrate that successful governance approaches should be people-centered, adaptable to local contexts and needs, engage a range of stakeholders across different scales and sectors, and be flexible to incorporate local practices and ideas, and changes in these over time. Cases present a range of models and techniques for fostering these conditions, and acheiving forest restoration at the landscape scale.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031195', 'afid': '60031195', 'affilname': 'International Rice Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Makati', 'affiliation-country': 'Philippines'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wilson S.', 'Cagalanan D.']","['56848464100', '55938465500']",Community-based forest management | Ecological restoration | Forest conservation | Forest landscape restoration | Governance | Natural resource management,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2452292916301710,1313788

New forests are expanding around the world. In many regions, regrowth rates are surpassing deforestation rates, resulting in “forest transitions,” or net gains in forest cover. Typically measured only in terms of aggregate“’forest cover” change, these new forests are ecologically distinct from each other and from those originally cleared. We ask, what are the ecological attributes, goods, and services we might expect from different pathways of forest recovery? To address this question, we proposed a typology of forest transitions that reflects both their social drivers and ecological outcomes: tree plantation, spontaneous regeneration, and agroforestry transitions. Using case studies, we illustrate how the ecological outcomes of each transition type differ and change over time. We mapped the global distribution of forest-transition types to identify global epicenters of each, and found that spontaneous transitions are most common globally, especially in Latin America; agroforestry transitions predominate in Europe and Central America; and plantation transitions occur in parts of Europe and Asia. We proposed a conceptual framework to understand and compare the ecological services arising from different types of forest transitions over time: forest ecosystem-service transition curves. This framework illustrates that carbon sequestration tends to be comparatively lower in agroforestry transitions, and biodiversity recovery is lower in industrial plantations. Spontaneously regenerating forests tend to have relatively high biodiversity and biomass but provide fewer provisioning and economically valuable services. This framework captures the dynamism that we observe in forest transitions, thus illustrating that different social drivers produce different types of ecosystem-service transitions, and that as secondary forests grow, these services will change over time at rates that differ among transition types. Ultimately, this framework can guide future research, describe actual and potential changes in ecosystem services associated with different types of transitions, and promote management plans that incorporate forest cover changes with the services and benefits they provide.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003933', 'afid': '60003933', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (UNT)', 'affiliation-city': 'San Miguel de Tucuman', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120299412', 'afid': '120299412', 'affilname': 'Instituto de Ecología Regional', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120298839', 'afid': '120298839', 'affilname': 'PARTNERS Reforestation Network', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112515764', 'afid': '112515764', 'affilname': 'CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Tucumán', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106929531', 'afid': '106929531', 'affilname': 'Southern Research Station', 'affiliation-city': 'Asheville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Wilson S.J.', 'Schelhas J.', 'Grau R.', 'Nanni A.S.', 'Sloan S.']","['56848464100', '6602484071', '56941539600', '56091357600', '24504004400']",Biodiversity | Carbon | Ecosystem services | Forest conservation | Forest cover change | Forest transition | Land use change | Plantations | Secondary forest,,7College,,,1313788

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Assessing the conservation value of restoration plantings is critical to support the global forest landscape restoration movement. We assessed the implications of tree species selection in the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest regarding carbon stocking and species conservation. This assessment was based on a comprehensive dataset of seedling acquisition records from 961 restoration projects, more than14 million seedlings, 192 forest remnants, and functional data from 1,223 tree species. We found that animal-dispersed trees with larger seeds tend to have higher seed prices, yet are underrepresented in the seedlings acquired for restoration plantations. Compared to forest remnants, fruit supply potentially offered by the species acquired for restoration plantings is lower for birds, but higher for bats. Reduced abundance of medium- and/or large-seeded, animal-dispersed trees lead to declines of 2.8–10.6% in simulated potential carbon stocking. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, policy interventions may be needed to encourage greater representation of large-seeded, animal-dispersed tree species in Atlantic Forest restorations. These findings provide critical guidance for recovering tree functional diversity, plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions, and carbon stocking in multi-species tropical forest restoration plantings.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006627', 'afid': '60006627', 'affilname': 'CSIC- Estación Biológica de Doñana EBD', 'affiliation-city': 'Sevilla', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006028', 'afid': '60006028', 'affilname': 'UNESP-Universidade Estadual Paulista', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001319', 'afid': '60001319', 'affilname': 'Missouri Botanical Garden', 'affiliation-city': 'St. Louis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121115325', 'afid': '121115325', 'affilname': 'Centro de Experimentos Florestais', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113353982', 'afid': '113353982', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Brancalion P.', 'Bello C.', 'Chazdon R.', 'Galetti M.', 'Jordano P.', 'Lima R.', 'Medina A.', 'Pizo M.', 'Reid J.']","['21740850700', '56707047000', '6603743015', '7004205870', '6701660089', '15836906900', '57201682532', '6602776865', '55388476000']",forest nurseries | keystone species | mutualistic interactions | restoration monitoring | restoration plantations | seed dispersal | seed size | seedling production | species reintroduction,CNPq,2013/22492-2,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,,1313788

In some cases, naturally regenerating forests are not comparable to the community structure of primary forests after many decades. However, direct comparison of the outcomes of tropical forest restoration and natural regeneration is hindered by differences in metrics of forest recovery, inconsistency in land use histories, and dissimilarities in experimental design. We present the results of a replicated reforestation experiment comparing natural regeneration and polyculture tree planting at multiple diversity levels (3, 6, 9, or 12 native tree species), with uniform land use history and initial edaphic conditions. We compare the recovery of basal area and floristic diversity in these treatments after 5 yr of succession. Total basal area was higher in planted plots than in naturally regenerating plots, but it but did not vary among the different planted diversity levels. The basal area of woody recruits did not differ among treatments. The diversity of woody recruits increased substantially over time but did not vary among planting treatments. Species composition trajectories showed directional turnover over time, with no consistent differences among treatments.

Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms.

Here, we explore the potential of markets and their interaction with policies to leverage investment for FLR in the tropics. We first review the challenges and opportunities of exploiting market forces for FLR, which can be essential for kick-starting the implementation of programs globally. We identify four key opportunities for regulating markets to promote FLR: economic mechanisms; technological, educational or infrastructural investment; legal and enforcement mechanisms; and market-led standards and certification schemes. Finally, we present five pitfalls that may arise when relying on markets to promote FLR. Governments will need to play a critical role in establishing appropriate policy frameworks and institutional arrangements to leverage investments when market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in traditional land use or farming practices, or to regulate reforestation activities when market signals become so strong that they overwhelm all other land-use activities, leading to a transformed and homogenized landscape.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60077597', 'afid': '60077597', 'affilname': 'Union of Concerned Scientists', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032607', 'afid': '60032607', 'affilname': 'University of the Sunshine Coast', 'affiliation-city': 'Sippy Downs', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032361', 'afid': '60032361', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881', 'afid': '60001881', 'affilname': 'University of Sheffield', 'affiliation-city': 'Sheffield', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113353982', 'afid': '113353982', 'affilname': 'International Institute for Sustainability', 'affiliation-city': 'Rio de Janeiro', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Review,"['Brancalion P.', 'Lamb D.', 'Ceccon E.', 'Boucher D.', 'Herbohn J.', 'Strassburg B.', 'Edwards D.']","['21740850700', '56017151900', '56388611800', '57204401015', '6603005931', '35612631400', '7404087101']",Ecological economics | Ecosystem services | Forest governance | Large-scale restoration | Tropical forest restoration | Tropical reforestation | Wood production,CNPq,304817/2015-5,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1389934116304580,1313788

In this paper, we explore the potential application of an innovation approach to bridge the gap between knowledge and action in restoration. The most promising innovation strategy for restoration is the adaptation of solutions developed in other fields of activity, for which market forces have historically supported programs of research and development. However, innovations in restoration may not rely only on technological tools requiring high investments. Rather, there are many opportunities for making better use of the existing funds and for low-cost solutions if restoration science and practice are reframed and integrated. If research projects are conceived to promote a co-production of knowledge with end users, valuable solutions for restoration problems may arise without extra investments. For restoration practice, substantial advances in our capacity to revert degradation could be obtained by shifting the focus from plot-scale, expensive solutions to the promotion of natural regeneration in sites where it is ecologically viable and socioeconomically feasible. For capacity building, promising approaches include emulating other models of technology transfer, mainly those used in agriculture, and fostering the use of web-based solutions. For governance, we recommend the promotion of ""policy triggers"" and better use of technology to obtain and integrate information. Finally, multi-stakeholder coalitions may contribute by linking these different fields of restoration and promoting the co-creation of solutions in complex socio-ecological systems. Large-scale restoration will not be achieved by the simple sum of small-scale projects implemented by traditional restoration approaches, so innovation can play an utmost role to fulfill the decades-old promise of restoration to reverse degradation at the landscape scale.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088', 'afid': '60008088', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP', 'affiliation-city': 'Sao Paulo', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}]",Journal,Article,"['Brancalion P.', 'Van Melis J.']","['21740850700', '36661444200']",Capacity building | cost-effective restoration | restoration ecology | restoration governance | restoration policy,,10.3417/2016034,R.J.

On 3 September 1998, a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) that originated from Tam Pokhari occurred in the Hinku valley of the eastern Nepal Himalaya. This study analyses the lake's geomorphic and hydrologic conditions prior to the outburst, and evaluates the conditions that could contribute to a future flood through photogrammetric techniques. We processed high-resolution Corona KH-4A (2.7m) and ALOS PRISM (2.5m) stereo-images taken before and after the GLOF event, and produced detailed topographic maps (2-m contour interval) and DEMs (5m×5m). We (re-) constructed lake water surfaces before (4410±5m) and after (4356±5m) the outburst, and reliably estimated the lake water surface lowering (54±5m) and the water volume released (19.5±2.2×106m3) from the lake, showing good agreement with the results obtained from ground-based measurements. The most relevant conditions that may have influenced the catastrophic drainage of Tam Pokhari in 1998 include the presence of: (i) a narrow (75±6m), steep (up to 50°) and high (120±5m) moraine dam; (ii) high lake level (8±5m of freeboard) and (iii) a steep overhanging glacier (>40°). The lake outburst substantially altered the immediate area, creating a low and wide (>500m) outwash plain below the lake, a wide lake outlet channel (∼50m) and a gentle channel slope (∼3-5°). Our new data suggest that the likelihood of a future lake outburst is low. Our results demonstrate that the datasets produced by photogrammetric techniques provide an excellent representation of micro-landform features on moraine dams, lake water surfaces and the changes in both over time, thereby allowing highly accurate pre- and post-GLOF (volumetric) change analysis of glacial lakes.

Debris thickness plays an important role in regulating ablation rates on debris-covered glaciers as well as controlling the likely size and location of supraglacial lakes. Despite its importance, lack of knowledge about debris properties and associated energy fluxes prevents the robust inclusion of the effects of a debris layer into most glacier surface energy balance models. This study combines fieldwork with a debris-covered glacier energy balance model to estimate debris temperatures and ablation rates on Imja-Lhotse Shar Glacier located in the Everest region of Nepal. The debris properties that significantly influence the energy balance model are the thermal conductivity, albedo, and surface roughness. Fieldwork was conducted to measure thermal conductivity and a method was developed using Structure from Motion to estimate surface roughness. Debris temperatures measured during the 2014 melt season were used to calibrate and validate a debris-covered glacier energy balance model by optimizing the albedo, thermal conductivity, and surface roughness at 10 debris-covered sites. Furthermore, three methods for estimating the latent heat flux were investigated. Model calibration and validation found the three methods had similar performance; however, comparison of modeled and measured ablation rates revealed that assuming the latent heat flux is zero may overestimate ablation. Results also suggest that where debris moisture is unknown, measurements of the relative humidity or precipitation may be used to estimate wet debris periods, i.e., when the latent heat flux is non-zero. The effect of temporal resolution on the model was also assessed and results showed that both 6 h data and daily average data slightly underestimate debris temperatures and ablation rates; thus these should only be used to estimate rough ablation rates when no other data are available.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012070', 'afid': '60012070', 'affilname': 'University of Leeds', 'affiliation-city': 'Leeds', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rounce D.', 'Quincey D.', 'McKinney D.']","['55356746200', '9533303700', '7006241176']",,,undefined,,,1516912

Glacial-dominated areas pose unique challenges to downstream communities in adapting to recent and continuing global climate change, including increased threats of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that can increase risk due to flooding of downstream communities and cause substantial impacts on regional social, environmental and economic systems. The Imja glacial lake in Nepal, with potential to generate a GLOF, was studied using a two-dimensional debris flow inundation model in order to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed measures to reduce possible flooding impacts to downstream communities by lowering the lake level. The results indicate that only minor flood impact reduction is achieved in the downstream community of Dingboche with modest (∼3m) lake lowering. Lowering the lake by 10m shows a significant reduction in inundated area. However, lowering the lake by 20 m almost eliminates all flood impact at Dingboche.

This study initially uses previous qualitative and quantitative assessments to understand the hazards associated with eight glacial lakes in the Nepal Himalaya that are widely considered to be highly dangerous. The previous assessments yield conflicting classifications with respect to each glacial lake, which spurred the development of a new holistic, reproducible, and objective approach based solely on remotely sensed data. This remote hazard assessment analyzes mass movement entering the lake, the stability of the moraine, and lake growth in conjunction with a geometric GLOF to determine the downstream impacts such that the present and future risk associated with each glacial lake may be quantified. The new approach is developed within a hazard, risk, and management action framework with the aim that this remote assessment may guide future field campaigns, modeling efforts, and ultimately risk-mitigation strategies.

This paper studies the lake dynamics for avalanche-triggered glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in Ancash, Peru. As new glacial lakes emerge and existing lakes continue to grow, they pose an increasing threat of GLOFs that can be catastrophic to the communities living downstream. In this work, the dynamics of displacement waves produced from avalanches are studied through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of Lake Palcacocha, Peru, with an emphasis on the sensitivity of the lake model to input parameters and boundary conditions. This type of avalanche-generated wave is an important link in the GLOF process chain because there is a high potential for overtopping and erosion of the lake-damming moraine. The lake model was evaluated for sensitivity to turbulence model and grid resolution, and the uncertainty due to these model parameters is significantly less than that due to avalanche boundary condition characteristics. Wave generation from avalanche impact was simulated using two different boundary condition methods. Representation of an avalanche as water flowing into the lake generally resulted in higher peak flows and overtopping volumes than simulating the avalanche impact as mass-momentum inflow at the lake boundary. Three different scenarios of avalanche size were simulated for the current lake conditions, and all resulted in significant overtopping of the lake-damming moraine. Although the lake model introduces significant uncertainty, the avalanche portion of the GLOF process chain is likely to be the greatest source of uncertainty. To aid in evaluation of hazard mitigation alternatives, two scenarios of lake lowering were investigated. While large avalanches produced significant overtopping waves for all lake-lowering scenarios, simulations suggest that it may be possible to contain waves generated from smaller avalanches if the surface of the lake is lowered.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chisolm R.', 'McKinney D.']","['56148972700', '7006241176']",,,undefined,,,1516912

Although the lake drained spontaneously the next day, it caused nationwide concern and triggered emergency responses. We identified the primary flood trigger as a massive rockfall from the northwest face of Saldim Peak (6388 m) which fell approximately 570 m down to the unnamed glacier above Langmale glacial lake, causing a massive dust cloud and hurricane-force winds. The impact also precipitated an avalanche, carrying blocks of rock and ice up to 5 m in diameter that plummeted a further 630 m down into Langmale glacial lake, triggering a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). The flood carved steep canyons, scoured the river’s riparian zone free of vegetation, and deposited sediment, debris, and boulders throughout much of the river channel from the settlement of Langmale to the settlement of Yangle Kharka about 6.5 km downstream.

Exacerbated by climate change, much of the focus in the Himalayas so far has been on GLOF risk anticipation. Recent research suggested the gaps in how scientific information on GLOFs has been communicated to local communities and the resulting distrust in government-led mitigation efforts such as, lake lowering and early warning systems. These gaps are largely driven by a set of socio-economic, cultural and institutional factors, which are poorly understood. Applying an institutional analysis framework, this research examines the institutional conditions under which Himalayan communities can create effective strategies to address GLOF risks. This research applies a mixed-methods approach by combining a) quantitative analysis of household social surveys, and b) qualitative analysis that maps out the various institutional factors that influence the success of community-level mitigation efforts. Additionally, GLOF case studies from Nepal are compared to those of Peru, where a long history of managing GLOFs exists. A set of critical institutional factors and barriers have been identified, including lack of cross-scalar communication networks, a mismatch between the agenda of external agencies and priorities of local communities, failure to recognize the value of local knowledge and participation in policy processes, and ineffective inter-organizational coordination of knowledge sharing and funding streams for mitigation projects.

Social scientists have traditionally investigated human behavior, but scholars often argue that behavior is too complex to be represented by broad generalizations useful for models and scenarios.

Not only is the regime shift frequently triggered by human activity, but the responses of relevant actors to ecological dynamics are often crucial to the development and even existence of the regime shift. Here, we show that the dynamics of human behaviour in response to ecological changes can be crucial in determining the overall dynamics of the system. We find a social-ecological regime shift in a model of harvesters of a common-pool resource who avoid over-exploitation of the resource by social ostracism of non-complying harvesters. The regime shift, which can be triggered by several different drivers individually or also in combination, consists of a breakdown of the social norm, sudden collapse of co-operation and an over-exploitation of the resource. We use the approach of generalized modeling to study the robustness of the regime shift to uncertainty over the specific forms of model components such as the ostracism norm and the resource dynamics. Importantly, the regime shift in our model does not occur if the dynamics of harvester behaviour are not included in the model. Finally, we sketch some possible early warning signals for the social-ecological regime shifts we observe in the models. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",94,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003059', 'afid': '60003059', 'affilname': 'London School of Economics and Political Science', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002014', 'afid': '60002014', 'affilname': 'The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lade S.J.', 'Tavoni A.', 'Levin S.A.', 'Schlüter M.']","['36893082400', '45561690000', '26643470900', '23987171200']",Bifurcation | Early warning signals | Generalized modelling | Regime shifts | social-ecological system | Tipping points,FP7,FP/2007-2013,Seventh Framework Programme,,1211972

Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions thatmaintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others.

A key feature of our experimental design is to have the exact same regulations chosen endogenously as those that are imposed exogenously. When we compare the same regulations chosen endogenously to those externally imposed, we observe no differences in extraction levels among CPR users in a laboratory experiment. We also observe no differences between weak external regulations and no regulations, after controlling for a potential confound.

Marine phytoplankton are a taxonomically and functionally diverse group of organisms that are key players in the most important biogeochemical cycles. Phytoplankton taxa show different resource utilization strategies (e.g. nutrient-uptake rates and cellular allocation) and traits. Therefore, acknowledging this diversity is crucial to understanding how elemental cycles operate, including the origin and dynamics of elemental ratios. In this paper, we focus on trait-based models as tools to study the role of phytoplankton diversity in the stoichiometric phenomenology observed in the laboratory and in the open ocean. We offer a compilation of known empirical results on stoichiometry and summarize how trait-based approaches have attempted to replicate these results. By contrasting the different ecological and evolutionary approaches available in the literature, we explore the strengths and limitations of the existing models. We thus try to identify existing gaps and challenges, and point to potential new directions that can be explored to fill these gaps. We aim to highlight the potential of including diversity explicitly in our modeling approaches, which can help us gain important knowledge about changes in local and global stoichiometric patterns.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024724', 'afid': '60024724', 'affilname': 'University of Strathclyde', 'affiliation-city': 'Glasgow', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013791', 'afid': '60013791', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Bonachela J.', 'Klausmeier C.', 'Edwards K.', 'Litchman E.', 'Levin S.']","['15062265200', '6602254336', '8557424000', '6602591794', '26643470900']",Phytoplankton | Redfield | Stoichiometry | Trait-based models,NSF,GEO-1211972,National Science Foundation,,1211972

All rights reserved. Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions, self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change, however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it. The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level of cooperation in the community. If two socially separate groups are ecologically connected through resource leakage, cooperation in one can destabilize the other.

Modeling the dynamics of marine populations at a global scale - from phytoplankton to fish - is necessary if we are to quantify how climate change and other broad-scale anthropogenic actions affect the supply of marine-based food. Here, we estimate the abundance and distribution of fish biomass using a simple size-based food web model coupled to simulations of global ocean physics and biogeochemistry. We focus on the spatial distribution of biomass, identifying highly productive regions - shelf seas, western boundary currents and major upwelling zones. In the absence of fishing, we estimate the total ocean fish biomass to be ~2.84 × 109 tonnes, similar to previous estimates. However, this value is sensitive to the choice of parameters, and further, allowing fish to move had a profound impact on the spatial distribution of fish biomass and the structure of marine communities. In particular, when movement is implemented the viable range of large predators is greatly increased, and stunted biomass spectra characterizing large ocean regions in simulations without movement, are replaced with expanded spectra that include large predators. These results highlight the importance of considering movement in global-scale ecological models.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027716', 'afid': '60027716', 'affilname': 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Watson J.', 'Stock C.', 'Sarmiento J.']","['57209809196', '9846295300', '7005720211']",,,GEO-1211972,Nippon Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0079661114001463,1211972

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. In Italy, few multicentre population-based studies on pregnancy outcomes are available. Therefore, we established a network of population-based birth cohorts in the cities of Turin, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Rome (northern and central Italy), to study the role of socioeconomic factors and air pollution exposure on term low birthweight, preterm births and the prevalence of small for gestational age. In this article, we will report the full methodology of the study and the first descriptive results. We linked 2007–2013 delivery certificates with municipal registry data and hospital records, and selected singleton livebirths from women who lived in the cities for the entire pregnancy, resulting in 211,853 births (63% from Rome, 21% from Turin and the remaining 16% from the three cities in Emilia-Romagna Region). We have observed that the association between socioeconomic characteristics and air pollution exposure varies by city and pollutant, suggesting a possible effect modification of both the city and the socioeconomic position on the impact of air pollution on pregnancy outcomes. This is the largest Italian population-based birth cohort, not distorted by selection mechanisms, which has also the advantage of being sustainable over time and easily transferable to other areas. Results from the ongoing multivariable analyses will provide more insight on the relative impact of different strands of risk factors and on their interaction, as well as on the modifying effect of the contextual characteristics.

Social capital is an important resource that can be mobilized for purposive action or competitive gain. The distribution of social capital in social–ecological systems can determine who is more productive at extracting ecological resources and who emerges as influential in guiding their management, thereby empowering some while disempowering others. Despite its importance, the factors that contribute to variation in social capital among individuals have not been widely studied. We adopt a network perspective to examine what determines social capital among individuals in social–ecological systems. We begin by identifying network measures of social capital relevant for individuals in this context, and review existing evidence concerning their determinants. Using a complete social network dataset from Hawaii’s longline fishery, we employ social network analysis and other statistical methods to empirically estimate these measures and determine the extent to which individual stakeholder attributes explain variation within them. We find that ethnicity is the strongest predictor of social capital. Measures of human capital (i.e., education, experience), years living in the community, and information-sharing attitudes are also important. Surprisingly, we find that when controlling for other factors, industry leaders and formal fishery representatives are generally not well connected. Our results offer new quantitative insights on the relationship between stakeholder diversity, social networks, and social capital in a coupled social–ecological system, which can aid in identifying barriers and opportunities for action to overcome resource management problems. Our results also have implications for achieving resource governance that is not only ecologically and economically sustainable, but also equitable.",33,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032935', 'afid': '60032935', 'affilname': 'USDA Economic Research Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024063', 'afid': '60024063', 'affilname': 'University of Massachusetts Boston', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013791', 'afid': '60013791', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003579', 'afid': '60003579', 'affilname': 'School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Barnes-Mauthe M.', 'Gray S.A.', 'Arita S.', 'Lynham J.', 'Leung P.S.']","['56575902600', '35310150500', '55661853200', '24833243300', '7401748972']","Ethnic diversity, Stakeholder attributes | Human capital | Natural resource management | Social capital | Social networks",NSF,GEO-1211972,National Science Foundation,,1211972

We find that the fastest path between two patches - each randomly located anywhere in the surface ocean - is, on average, less than a decade.

We suggest an ensemble of available models and projections, informed by observations, as a starting point to quantify uncertainties. Such an ensemble must be paired with analysis of the dominant uncertainties over different spatial scales, time horizons, and metrics. We use two examples: (i) global and regional projections of Sea Surface Temperature and (ii) projection of changes in potential catch of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in the 21st century, to illustrate this ensemble model approach to explore different types of uncertainties. Further effort should prioritize understanding dominant, undersampled dimensions of uncertainty, as well as the strategic collection of observations to quantify, and ultimately reduce, uncertainties.

However, because of larval dispersal, coral populations can receive larvae from corals that are adapted to very different temperature regimes. We combine an offline particle tracking routine with output from a high-resolution physical oceanographic model to investigate whether connectivity of coral larvae between reefs of different thermal regimes could alter the thermal stress threshold of corals. Our results suggest that larval transport between reefs of widely varying temperatures is likely in the Coral Triangle and that accounting for this connectivity may be important in bleaching predictions.

Background: Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). Results: We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Conclusions: Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026479', 'afid': '60026479', 'affilname': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliation-city': 'Exeter', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Berdahl A.', 'Leeuwen A.', 'Levin S.', 'Torney C.']","['23479355600', '57195319007', '26643470900', '24588214300']",Anadromous fish | Collective navigation | Dispersal | Local adaptation | Migration | Migratory birds | Migratory marine fish | Migratory ungulates | Population collapse,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1211972

Index-based insurances offer promising opportunities for climate-risk investments in developing countries. Indeed, contracts conditional on, e.g., weather or livestock indexes can be cheaper to set up than conventional indemnity-based insurances, while offering a safety net to vulnerable households, allowing them to eventually escape poverty traps. Moreover, transaction costs by insurance companies may be additionally reduced if contracts, instead of arranged with single households, are endorsed by collectives of households that bear the responsibility of managing the division of the insurance coverage by its members whenever the index is surpassed, allowing for additional flexibility in what concerns risk-sharing and also allowing insurance companies to avoid the costs associated with moral hazard. Here we resort to a population dynamics framework to investigate under which conditions household collectives may find collective index insurances attractive, when compared with individual index insurances. We assume risk sharing among the participants of each collective, and model collective action in terms of an N-person threshold game. Compared to less affordable individual index insurances, we show how collective index insurances lead to a coordination problem in which the adoption of index insurances may become the optimal decision, spreading index insurance coverage to the entire population. We further investigate the role of risk-averse and risk-prone behaviors, as well as the role of partial correlation between insurance coverage and actual loss of crops, and in which way these affect the original coordination thresholds.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027202', 'afid': '60027202', 'affilname': 'Resources For The Future Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020475', 'afid': '60020475', 'affilname': 'Universidade do Minho', 'affiliation-city': 'Braga', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004956', 'afid': '60004956', 'affilname': 'Instituto Superior Técnico', 'affiliation-city': 'Lisbon', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/105940586', 'afid': '105940586', 'affilname': 'ATP-group', 'affiliation-city': 'Lisbon', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100650314', 'afid': '100650314', 'affilname': 'Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pacheco J.', 'Santos F.', 'Levin S.']","['7101665113', '9845451400', '26643470900']",Collective action | Evolutionary game theory | Index insurance | Non-linear returns,NSF,GEO-1211972,National Science Foundation,,1211972

Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions, self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change, however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it. The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level of cooperation in the community. If two socially separate groups are ecologically connected through resource leakage, cooperation in one can destabilize the other. These findings provide insights into possible effects of global change and spatial connectivity, indicating that there is no simple answer as to their effects on cooperation and sustainable resource use.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027202', 'afid': '60027202', 'affilname': 'Resources For The Future Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003059', 'afid': '60003059', 'affilname': 'London School of Economics and Political Science', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100650314', 'afid': '100650314', 'affilname': 'Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Schlüter M.', 'Tavoni A.', 'Levin S.']","['23987171200', '45561690000', '26643470900']",Collapse | Common-pool resource | Cooperation | Global change | Norms | Social-ecological system,ESRC,GEO-1211972,Economic and Social Research Council,,1211972

Not only is the regime shift frequently triggered by human activity, but the responses of relevant actors to ecological dynamics are often crucial to the development and even existence of the regime shift. Here, we show that the dynamics of human behaviour in response to ecological changes can be crucial in determining the overall dynamics of the system. We find a social-ecological regime shift in a model of harvesters of a common-pool resource who avoid over-exploitation of the resource by social ostracism of non-complying harvesters. The regime shift, which can be triggered by several different drivers individually or also in combination, consists of a breakdown of the social norm, sudden collapse of co-operation and an over-exploitation of the resource. We use the approach of generalized modeling to study the robustness of the regime shift to uncertainty over the specific forms of model components such as the ostracism norm and the resource dynamics. Importantly, the regime shift in our model does not occur if the dynamics of harvester behaviour are not included in the model. Finally, we sketch some possible early warning signals for the social-ecological regime shifts we observe in the models. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",94,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003059', 'afid': '60003059', 'affilname': 'London School of Economics and Political Science', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002014', 'afid': '60002014', 'affilname': 'The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lade S.J.', 'Tavoni A.', 'Levin S.A.', 'Schlüter M.']","['36893082400', '45561690000', '26643470900', '23987171200']",Bifurcation | Early warning signals | Generalized modelling | Regime shifts | social-ecological system | Tipping points,FP7,FP/2007-2013,Seventh Framework Programme,,1211972

This book is the first comprehensive effort to bring together Water, Food Security and Nutrition (FSN) in a way that goes beyond the traditional focus on irrigated agriculture. Apart from looking at the role of water and sanitation for human well-being, it proposes alternative and more locally appropriate ways to address complex water management and governance challenges from the local to global levels against a backdrop of growing uncertainties. The authors challenge mainstream supply-oriented and neo-Malthusian visions that argue for the need to increase the land area under irrigation in order to feed the world’s growing population. Instead, they argue for a reframing of the debate concerning production processes, waste, food consumption and dietary patterns whilst proposing alternative strategies to improve water and land productivity, putting the interests of marginalized and disenfranchized groups upfront. The book highlights how accessing water for FSN can be challenging for small-holders, vulnerable and marginalized women and men, and how water allocation systems and reform processes can negatively affect local people’s informal rights. The book argues for the need to improve policy coherence across water, land and food and is original in making a case for strengthening the relationship between the human rights to water and food, especially for marginalized women and men.

Predators of all kinds, be they lions hunting in the Serengeti or fishermen searching for their catch, display various collective strategies. A common strategy is to share information about the location of prey. However, depending on the spatial characteristics and mobility of predators and prey, information sharing can either improve or hinder individual success. Here, our goal is to investigate the interacting effects of space and information sharing on predation efficiency, represented by the expected rate at which prey are found and consumed. We derive a feeding functional response that accounts for both spatio-temporal heterogeneity and communication, and validate this mathematical analysis with a computational agent-based model. This agent-based model has an explicit yet minimal representation of space, as well as information sharing about the location of prey. The analytical model simplifies predator behavior into a few discrete states and one essential trade-off, between the individual benefit of acquiring information and the cost of creating spatial and temporal correlation between predators. Despite the absence of an explicit spatial dimension in these equations, they quantitatively predict the predator consumption rates measured in the agent-based simulations across the explored parameter space. Together, the mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations identify the conditions for when there is a benefit to sharing information, and also when there is a cost.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008134', 'afid': '60008134', 'affilname': 'CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique', 'affiliation-city': 'Paris', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}]",Journal,Article,"['Barbier M.', 'Watson J.']","['55359452800', '57209809196']",,,undefined,,,1211972

Background: Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). Results: We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Conclusions: Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026479', 'afid': '60026479', 'affilname': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliation-city': 'Exeter', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Berdahl A.', 'Leeuwen A.', 'Levin S.', 'Torney C.']","['23479355600', '57195319007', '26643470900', '24588214300']",Anadromous fish | Collective navigation | Dispersal | Local adaptation | Migration | Migratory birds | Migratory marine fish | Migratory ungulates | Population collapse,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1211972

Marine social-ecological systems are constantly changing, and fishers who make a living from working the seas are continually adapting in response to different sources of variability. One main way in which fishers can adapt to ecosystem change is to change the fisheries they participate in. This acts to connect fisheries, creating interlinked networks of alternative sources of income for fishers. Here, we synthesize fisheries data and construct fisheries connectivity networks for all major ports in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Fisheries connectivity networks are comprised of nodes, which are fisheries, connected by edges, whose weights are proportional to the number of participating vessels. Fisheries connectivity networks identify central fisheries in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, specifically Dungeness crab and Spiny Lobster, and systematic topological differences, e.g. in network resilience and modularity. These network metrics directly relate to the social vulnerability of coastal fishing communities, especially their sensitivity and capacity to adapt to perturbation. Ultimately, improving knowledge of fisheries connectivity is vital if policy makers are to create governance institutions that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental, technological and management change while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries. In doing so, new policies that account for fisheries connectivity, will lead to improved sustainable fisheries management, and enhanced socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003723', 'afid': '60003723', 'affilname': 'NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

All rights reserved. Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives - either economic or social norms, or both - can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.",46,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Lubchenco J.', 'Cerny-Chipman E.', 'Reimer J.', 'Levin S.']","['6701631227', '56829484100', '56828943000', '26643470900']",Complex adaptive systems | Conservation solutions | Fisheries | Marine reserves | Rights-based fishery management,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1211972

Understanding how and when cooperative human behaviour forms in common-pool resource systems is critical to illuminating social-ecological systems and designing governance institutions that promote sustainable resource use. Before assessing the full complexity of social dynamics, it is essential to understand, concretely and mechanistically, how resource dynamics and human actions interact to create incentives and pay-offs for social behaviours. Here, we investigated how such incentives for information sharing are affected by spatial dynamics and management in a commonpool resource system. Using interviews with fishermen to inform an agent-based model, we reveal generic mechanisms through which, for a given ecological setting characterized by the spatial dynamics of the resource, the two ‘human factors’ of information sharing and management may heterogeneously impact various members of a group for whom theory would otherwise predict the same strategy. When users can deplete the resource, these interactions are further affected by the management approach. Finally, we discuss the implications of alternative motivations, such as equity among fishermen and consistency of the fleet’s output. Our results indicate that resource spatial dynamics, form of management and level of depletion can interact to alter the sociality of people in common-pool resource systems, providing necessary insight for future study of strategic decision processes.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103266', 'afid': '60103266', 'affilname': 'Farallon Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Petaluma', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114913032', 'afid': '114913032', 'affilname': 'Center for Biodiversity Theory and Modelling', 'affiliation-city': 'Moulis', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}]",Journal,Article,"['Klein E.', 'Barbier M.', 'Watson J.']","['57190607189', '55359452800', '57209809196']",Agent-based model | Common-pool resource | Cooperation | Fisheries management | Human behaviour | Spatial dynamics,NSF,1211972,National Science Foundation,,1211972

The vast literature discusses the pros and cons of participation but does not provide much information on the actual costs and value of participation. Hence, this review paper addresses the question: what does the literature tell us about the costs and value of participation, the evolution of the concept, and how participation costs and value have been problematized in relation to actors, levels, methods, variables, relationships between costs and value, output/outcome, geographical aspects, and contexts? Out of a larger set, the systematic review analyzes nine articles based on how the cost and value of participation are being calculated. Overall there is a lack of literature on how participation costs and value are being problematized and calculated. What is more – to the extent that this is done, the range of methods is small, limited variables are used to operationalize intangible costs and value, the focus is mainly on the local level, and the geographical distribution of case studies is limited. The literature suggests that the costs and value of participation are inequitably shared between actors. This may influence the kind of decisions being produced in the stakeholder's participation process. This causality calls for more attention for costs and benefits of participation to realize effective participation and a more inclusive participation process in environmental policy.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069392', 'afid': '60069392', 'affilname': 'Brawijaya University', 'affiliation-city': 'Malang', 'affiliation-country': 'Indonesia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022091', 'afid': '60022091', 'affilname': 'IHE Delft Institute for Water Education', 'affiliation-city': 'Delft', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002483', 'afid': '60002483', 'affilname': 'Universiteit van Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}]",Journal,Review,"['Anggraeni M.', 'Gupta J.', 'Verrest H.']","['57200107408', '7202539901', '17436036800']",Inclusive development | Participation cost | Participation value | Stakeholder participation,MOF,undefined,Ministry of Finance,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1462901118309699,1211972

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. In Italy, few multicentre population-based studies on pregnancy outcomes are available. Therefore, we established a network of population-based birth cohorts in the cities of Turin, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Rome (northern and central Italy), to study the role of socioeconomic factors and air pollution exposure on term low birthweight, preterm births and the prevalence of small for gestational age. In this article, we will report the full methodology of the study and the first descriptive results. We linked 2007–2013 delivery certificates with municipal registry data and hospital records, and selected singleton livebirths from women who lived in the cities for the entire pregnancy, resulting in 211,853 births (63% from Rome, 21% from Turin and the remaining 16% from the three cities in Emilia-Romagna Region). We have observed that the association between socioeconomic characteristics and air pollution exposure varies by city and pollutant, suggesting a possible effect modification of both the city and the socioeconomic position on the impact of air pollution on pregnancy outcomes. This is the largest Italian population-based birth cohort, not distorted by selection mechanisms, which has also the advantage of being sustainable over time and easily transferable to other areas. Results from the ongoing multivariable analyses will provide more insight on the relative impact of different strands of risk factors and on their interaction, as well as on the modifying effect of the contextual characteristics.

Index-based insurances offer promising opportunities for climate-risk investments in developing countries. Indeed, contracts conditional on, e.g., weather or livestock indexes can be cheaper to set up than conventional indemnity-based insurances, while offering a safety net to vulnerable households, allowing them to eventually escape poverty traps. Moreover, transaction costs by insurance companies may be additionally reduced if contracts, instead of arranged with single households, are endorsed by collectives of households that bear the responsibility of managing the division of the insurance coverage by its members whenever the index is surpassed, allowing for additional flexibility in what concerns risk-sharing and also allowing insurance companies to avoid the costs associated with moral hazard. Here we resort to a population dynamics framework to investigate under which conditions household collectives may find collective index insurances attractive, when compared with individual index insurances. We assume risk sharing among the participants of each collective, and model collective action in terms of an N-person threshold game. Compared to less affordable individual index insurances, we show how collective index insurances lead to a coordination problem in which the adoption of index insurances may become the optimal decision, spreading index insurance coverage to the entire population. We further investigate the role of risk-averse and risk-prone behaviors, as well as the role of partial correlation between insurance coverage and actual loss of crops, and in which way these affect the original coordination thresholds.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027202', 'afid': '60027202', 'affilname': 'Resources For The Future Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020475', 'afid': '60020475', 'affilname': 'Universidade do Minho', 'affiliation-city': 'Braga', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004956', 'afid': '60004956', 'affilname': 'Instituto Superior Técnico', 'affiliation-city': 'Lisbon', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/105940586', 'afid': '105940586', 'affilname': 'ATP-group', 'affiliation-city': 'Lisbon', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100650314', 'afid': '100650314', 'affilname': 'Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Pacheco J.', 'Santos F.', 'Levin S.']","['7101665113', '9845451400', '26643470900']",Collective action | Evolutionary game theory | Index insurance | Non-linear returns,NSF,GEO-1211972,National Science Foundation,,1211972

Context: Many nearshore species are distributed in habitat patches connected only through larval dispersal. Genetic research has shown some spatial structure of such metapopulations and modeling studies have shed light onto possible patterns of connectivity and barriers. However, little is known about human impact on their spatial structure and patterns of connectivity. Objectives: We examine the effects of fishing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of metapopulations of sedentary marine species (red sea urchin and red abalone) interconnected by larval dispersal. Methods: We constructed a metapopulation model to simulate abalone and sea urchin metapopulations experiencing increasing levels of fishing mortality. We performed the modularity analysis on the yearly larval connectivity matrices produced by these simulations, and analyzed the changes of modularity and the formation of modules over time as indicators of spatial structure. Results: The analysis revealed a strong modular spatial structure for abalone and a weak spatial signature for sea urchin. In abalone, under exploitation, modularity takes step-wise drops on the path to extinction, and modules breakdown into smaller fragments followed by module and later metapopulation collapse. In contrast, sea urchin showed high modularity variation, indicating high- and low-mixing years, but an abrupt collapse of the metapopulation under strong exploitation. Conclusions: The results identify a disruption in larval connectivity and a pattern of collapse in highly modular nearshore metapopulations. These results highlight the ability of modularity to detect spatial structure in marine metapopulations, which varies among species, and to show early changes in the spatial structure of exploited metapopulations.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Peña T.', 'Watson J.', 'González-Guzmán L.', 'Keitt T.']","['9435180900', '57209809196', '6506866312', '6701730989']",Allee effect | Larval connectivity | Marine metapopulation | Red abalone | Red sea urchin | Seascape ecology | Southern California Bight | Spatial structure,,undefined,,,1211972

Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions, self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change, however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it. The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level of cooperation in the community.

Marine phytoplankton stoichiometry links nutrient supply to marine carbon export. Deviations of phytoplankton stoichiometry from Redfield proportions (106C V 1P) could therefore have a significant impact on carbon cycling, and understanding which environmental factors drive these deviations may reveal new mechanisms regulating the carbon cycle. To explore the links between environmental conditions, stoichiometry, and carbon cycling, we compared four different models of phytoplankton C V P: a fixed Redfield model, a model with C V P given as a function of surface phosphorus concentration (P), a model with C V P given as a function of temperature, and a new multi-environmental model that predicts C V P as a function of light, temperature, and P. These stoichiometric models were embedded into a fivebox ocean circulation model, which resolves the three major ocean biomes (high-latitude, subtropical gyres, and tropical upwelling regions). Contrary to the expectation of a monotonic relationship between surface nutrient drawdown and carbon export, we found that lateral nutrient transport from lower CV P tropical waters to high CV P subtropical waters could cause carbon export to decrease with increased tropical nutrient utilization. It has been hypothesized that a positive feedback between temperature and pCO2;atm will play an important role in anthropogenic climate change, with changes in the biological pump playing at most a secondary role. Here we show that environmentally driven shifts in stoichiometry make the biological pump more influential, and may reverse the expected positive relationship between temperature and pCO2;atm. In the temperature-only model, changes in tropical temperature have more impact on the 1 pCO2;atm (41 ppm) compared to subtropical temperature changes (4.5 ppm). Our multi-environmental model predicted a decline in pCO2;atm of 46 ppm when temperature spanned a change of 10C. Thus, we find that variation in marine phytoplankton stoichiometry and its environmental controlling factors can lead to nonlinear controls on pCO2;atm, suggesting the need for further studies of ocean C V P and the impact on ocean carbon cycling.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007278', 'afid': '60007278', 'affilname': 'University of California, Irvine', 'affiliation-city': 'Irvine', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Moreno A.', 'Hagstrom G.', 'Primeau F.', 'Levin S.', 'Martiny A.']","['56372510400', '56634661100', '7003557823', '26643470900', '10040264400']",,,OCE 1756906,National Science Foundation,,1211972

Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator–prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions. Understanding social behaviour for given social-ecological characteristics has important implications, particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations to move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability.

Coral communities continue to be threatened by chronic and acute stressors and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms that maintain their persistence. In this work, we use a model of coral-macroalgae dynamics to explore the effects of different assumptions regarding grazing and coral recruitment seasonality in coral-algae systems. We find that the grazing functional form constrains the potential for alternative stable states and coexistence, highlighting the need to further elucidate herbivore dynamics on reef systems. We also show that coral recruitment from external sources facilitates coral persistence and recovery, both when recruitment is assumed to be constant over time, and when recruitment occurs seasonally. In systems with alternative stable states, the total number of larvae that reaches a patch is the primary driver that dictates whether a system with low coral cover can flip into the coral-dominated basin of attraction. However, in a limited parameter space, the duration and timing of this larval pulse can also determine whether coral can recover in a bistable system. These results highlight the multiple factors that influence whether a coral reef is likely to remain in its present state or not, especially as ocean conditions change.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

We seek to explain the emergence of spatial heterogeneity regarding development and pollution on the basis of interactions associated with the movement of capital and polluting activities from one economy to another. We use a simple dynamical model describing capital accumulation along the lines of a fixed-savings-ratio Solow-type model capable of producing endogenous growth and convergence behavior, and pollution accumulation in each country with pollution diffusion between countries or regions. The basic mechanism underlying the movements of capital across space is the quest for locations where the marginal productivity of capital is relatively higher than the productivity at the location of origin. The notion that capital moves to locations of relatively higher productivity but not necessarily from locations of high concentration to locations of low concentration, does not face difficulties associated with the Lucas paradox. We show that, for a wide range of capital and pollution rates of flow, spatial heterogeneity emerges even between two economies with identical fundamental structures. These results can be interpreted as suggesting that the neoclassical convergence hypothesis might not hold under differential rates of flow of capital and polluting activities among countries of the same fundamental structure.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019507', 'afid': '60019507', 'affilname': 'Athens University of Economics and Business', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'Greece'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Levin S.', 'Xepapadeas A.']","['26643470900', '6701402028']",Capital | Diffusion | Pollution | Spatial heterogeneity | Transboundary flows | Turing instability,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1211972

These advances have been led by the development of new techniques for coupling ecological and evolutionary dynamics, for integrating dynamics across multiple scales of organization, and for using data to infer the complex interactions among different components of ecological systems. Focusing on the development and usage of these new methods, we discuss how they have led to an improved understanding of three universal features of complex adaptive systems, emergent patterns; tipping points and critical phenomena; and cooperative behavior.

Global patterns of planktonic diversity are mainly determined by the dispersal of propagules with ocean currents. However, the role that abundance and body size play in determining spatial patterns of diversity remains unclear. Here we analyse spatial community structure - β-diversity - for several planktonic and nektonic organisms from prokaryotes to small mesopelagic fishes collected during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. β-diversity was compared to surface ocean transit times derived from a global circulation model, revealing a significant negative relationship that is stronger than environmental differences. Estimated dispersal scales for different groups show a negative correlation with body size, where less abundant large-bodied communities have significantly shorter dispersal scales and larger species spatial turnover rates than more abundant small-bodied plankton. Our results confirm that the dispersal scale of planktonic and micro-nektonic organisms is determined by local abundance, which scales with body size, ultimately setting global spatial patterns of diversity.",20,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104285', 'afid': '60104285', 'affilname': 'Ikerbasque, the Basque Foundation for Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Bilbao', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019769', 'afid': '60019769', 'affilname': 'AZTI Fundazioa', 'affiliation-city': 'Derio', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017294', 'afid': '60017294', 'affilname': 'CSIC-UIB - Instituto Mediterraneo de Estudios Avanzados (IMEDEA)', 'affiliation-city': 'Esporlas', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016939', 'afid': '60016939', 'affilname': 'Centre for the Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Lowestoft', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016476', 'afid': '60016476', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Cadiz', 'affiliation-city': 'Cadiz', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009410', 'afid': '60009410', 'affilname': 'CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias Marinas de Andalucia (ICMAN)', 'affiliation-city': 'Cadiz', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007870', 'afid': '60007870', 'affilname': 'CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM)', 'affiliation-city': 'Barcelona', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006793', 'afid': '60006793', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Oviedo', 'affiliation-city': 'Oviedo', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000950', 'afid': '60000950', 'affilname': 'Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia', 'affiliation-city': 'Madrid', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109435159', 'afid': '109435159', 'affilname': 'King Abdullah University of Science Technology (KAUST)', 'affiliation-city': 'Thuwal', 'affiliation-country': 'Saudi Arabia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Villarino E.', 'Watson J.R.', 'Jönsson B.', 'Gasol J.M.', 'Salazar G.', 'Acinas S.G.', 'Estrada M.', 'Massana R.', 'Logares R.', 'Giner C.R.', 'Pernice M.C.', 'Olivar M.P.', 'Citores L.', 'Corell J.', 'Rodríguez-Ezpeleta N.', 'Acuña J.L.', 'Molina-Ramírez A.', 'González-Gordillo J.I.', 'Cózar A.', 'Martí E.', 'Cuesta J.A.', 'Agustí S.', 'Fraile-Nuez E.', 'Duarte C.M.', 'Irigoien X.', 'Chust G.']","['56737009900', '57209809196', '7401732343', '7003299234', '24725500700', '57214358852', '7102245674', '7003438945', '14054240600', '56891238300', '56702492600', '6701404333', '57200255082', '57200254530', '8624672000', '7004505799', '56871218100', '6601966381', '56045346000', '57214876377', '35279171100', '7003718000', '12139561900', '55636631300', '7003540025', '6602777359']",,,undefined,Eusko Jaurlaritza,,1211972

Fish and Fisheries Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Conflict over marine fishery resources is a growing security concern. Experts expect that global changes in our climate, food systems and oceans may spark or exacerbate resource conflicts. An initial scan of 803 relevant papers and subsequent intensive review of 31 fisheries conflict studies, focused on subnational and international conflicts, suggests that four substantial scientific gaps need addressing to improve our understanding of the nature and drivers of fisheries conflict. First, fisheries conflict and levels of conflict intensity are not precisely defined. Second, complex adaptive systems thinking is underutilized but has the potential to produce more realistic causal models of fishery conflict. Third, comparative large-scale data and suitably integrative methodologies are lacking, underscoring the need for a standardized and comparable database of fisheries conflict cases to aid extrapolation beyond single case-studies. Fourth, there is room for a more widespread application of higher order concepts and associated terminology. Importantly, the four gaps highlight the homogenized nature of current methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding fishery conflict, which potentially presents us with an oversimplified understanding of these conflicts. A more nuanced understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of fishery conflict and its causes is not only scientifically critical, but increasingly relevant for policymakers and practitioners in this turbulent world.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103900', 'afid': '60103900', 'affilname': 'Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences The University of Tokyo', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015157', 'afid': '60015157', 'affilname': 'Stockholm Environment Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}]",Journal,Article,"['Spijkers J.', 'Morrison T.', 'Blasiak R.', 'Cumming G.', 'Osborne M.', 'Watson J.', 'Österblom H.']","['57189894198', '35964161000', '56149946000', '7102080926', '57197794826', '57209809196', '6505898338']",climate change | complex adaptive systems | disputes | fishery resources | scarcity | security,,undefined,"Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council",,1211972

Context: Many nearshore species are distributed in habitat patches connected only through larval dispersal. Genetic research has shown some spatial structure of such metapopulations and modeling studies have shed light onto possible patterns of connectivity and barriers. However, little is known about human impact on their spatial structure and patterns of connectivity. Objectives: We examine the effects of fishing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of metapopulations of sedentary marine species (red sea urchin and red abalone) interconnected by larval dispersal. Methods: We constructed a metapopulation model to simulate abalone and sea urchin metapopulations experiencing increasing levels of fishing mortality. We performed the modularity analysis on the yearly larval connectivity matrices produced by these simulations, and analyzed the changes of modularity and the formation of modules over time as indicators of spatial structure. Results: The analysis revealed a strong modular spatial structure for abalone and a weak spatial signature for sea urchin. In abalone, under exploitation, modularity takes step-wise drops on the path to extinction, and modules breakdown into smaller fragments followed by module and later metapopulation collapse. In contrast, sea urchin showed high modularity variation, indicating high- and low-mixing years, but an abrupt collapse of the metapopulation under strong exploitation. Conclusions: The results identify a disruption in larval connectivity and a pattern of collapse in highly modular nearshore metapopulations. These results highlight the ability of modularity to detect spatial structure in marine metapopulations, which varies among species, and to show early changes in the spatial structure of exploited metapopulations.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372', 'afid': '60013372', 'affilname': 'The University of Texas at Austin', 'affiliation-city': 'Austin', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Peña T.', 'Watson J.', 'González-Guzmán L.', 'Keitt T.']","['9435180900', '57209809196', '6506866312', '6701730989']",Allee effect | Larval connectivity | Marine metapopulation | Red abalone | Red sea urchin | Seascape ecology | Southern California Bight | Spatial structure,,undefined,,,1211972

Context: The Mongolian Plateau, comprising Inner Mongolia, China (IM) and Mongolia (MG) is undergoing consistent warming and accelerated land cover/land use change. Extensive modifications of water-limited regions can alter ecosystem function and processes; hence, it is important to differentiate the impacts of human activities and precipitation dynamics on vegetation productivity. Objectives: This study distinguished between human-induced and precipitation-driven changes in vegetation cover on the plateau across biome, vegetation type and administrative divisions. Methods: Non-parametric trend tests were applied to the time series of vegetation indices (VI) derived from MODIS and AVHRR and precipitation from TRMM and MERRA reanalysis data. VI residuals adjusted for rainfall were obtained from the regression between growing season maximum VI and monthly accumulated rainfall (June–August) and were used to detect human-induced trends in vegetation productivity during 1981–2010. The total livestock and population density trends were identified and then used to explain the VI residual trends. Results: The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were negatively correlated to total livestock density (R2 = 0.59 and 0.16, p < 0.05) in MG and positively correlated with total population density (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.05) in IM. The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were also negatively correlated with goat density (R2 = 0.59 and 0.19, p < 0.05) and sheep density in MG (R2 = 0.59 and 0.13, p < 0.05) but not in IM. Conclusions: Some administrative subdivisions in IM and MG showed decreasing trends in VI residuals. These trends could be attributed to increasing livestock or population density and changes in livestock herd composition. Other subdivisions showed increasing trends residuals, suggesting that the vegetation cover increase could be attributed to conservation efforts.",48,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119216', 'afid': '60119216', 'affilname': 'University of the Humanities', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072642', 'afid': '60072642', 'affilname': 'Mongolian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022355', 'afid': '60022355', 'affilname': 'University of Montana', 'affiliation-city': 'Missoula', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['John R.', 'Chen J.', 'Kim Y.', 'Ou-yang Z.t.', 'Xiao J.', 'Park H.', 'Shao C.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Amarjargal A.', 'Batkhshig O.', 'Qi J.']","['23970517000', '8985856500', '55699587100', '55880999200', '8530104100', '56799345700', '24336312100', '8693543800', '56668753300', '56801105900', '7201522137']",EVI | EVI2 | GIMMS3 g NDVI | Livestock density | MODIS | Mongolian Plateau | Population density | Precipitation | RESTREND | Semi-arid | Vegetation indices,NSF,1313761,National Science Foundation,,1523628

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. To understand the carbon and energy exchange between the lake surface and the atmosphere, direct measurements of latent, sensible heat, and CO2 fluxes were taken using the eddy covariance (EC) technique in Western Lake Erie during October 2011 to September 2013. We found that the latent heat flux (LE) had a marked one-peak seasonal change in both years that differed from the diurnal course and lacked a sinusoidal dynamic common in terrestrial ecosystems. Daily mean LE was 4.8 ± 0.1 and 4.3 ± 0.2 MJ m-2 d-1 in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. The sensible heat flux (H) remained much lower than the LE, with a daily mean of 0.9 ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 0.1 MJ m-2 d-1 in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. As a result, the Bowen ratio was <1 during most of the 2 year period, with the lowest summer value at 0.14. The vapor pressure deficit explained 35% of the variation in half hourly LE, while the temperature difference between the water surface and air explained 65% of the variation in half hourly H. Western Lake Erie acted as a small carbon sink holding -19.0 ± 5.4 and -40.2 ± 13.3 g C m-2 in the first and second summers (May-September) but as an annual source of 77.7 ± 18.6 and 49.5 ± 17.9 g C m-2 yr-1 in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. The CO2 flux (FCO2) rate varied from -0.45 g C m-2 d-1 to 0.98 g C m-2 d-1. Similar to LE, FCO2 had noticeable diurnal changes during the months that had high chlorophyll a months but not during other months. A significantly negative correlation (P < 0.05) was found between FCO2 and chlorophyll a on monthly fluxes. Three gap-filling methods, including marginal distribution sampling, mean diurnal variation, and monthly mean, were quantitatively assessed, yielding an uncertainty of 4%, 6%, and 10% in LE, H, and FCO2, respectively.

Central to the concept of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS), humans and nature are organized into interacting subsystems of a cohesive whole at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Following an overview of the challenges in implementing the CHANS concept, we used widely available measures of social, economic, and ecological systems, including gross domestic product, population size, net primary productivity, and livestock and their ratios to examine CHANS dynamics on the Mongolian Plateau from 1981 to 2010. Our cross-border analysis of coupled dynamics over the past three decades demonstrated striking contrasts between Inner Mongolia (IM) and Mongolia (MG), with policies playing shifting roles in these measures.

Central to the concept of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS), humans and nature are organized into interacting subsystems of a cohesive whole at multiple spatial and temporal scales.

Phenology is well recognized as one of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. Previous studies have focused on flowering phenology with few efforts given to the phenological successes and vegetative processes. Additionally, grazing is often characterized as a driver for community evolutionary processes, while precipitation is known as the most important abiotic cue in arid regions. Given this knowledge, we installed a nested experiment in a desert steppe to explore the coupled effects of grazing and watering on plant species’ reproductive successes and phenological timing in 2012–2013. We found that grazing increased the proportion of non-flowering individuals, with a greater proportion in 2013 than that in 2012. It decreased species richness and changed the habitat preferences in both years, and watering also reduced the richness in both years. Grazing also delayed the phenological timing for some dominant species and significantly delayed the green-up timing (5.67 days) and shortened the growing season length (GSL) in both 2012 (7.74 days) and 2013 (4.71 days). The application of watering, however, delayed some dominant species’ timing—including the browning timing of five dominate species ranging from 9.57 days in 2013 to 1.93 days in 2012—but it did not delay the species’ green-up timing. This resulted in a significantly prolonged growing season in 2013 (8.58 days). The high soil water and optimal soil temperature in the spring of 2013 contributed to an earlier green-up time (6.1 days) than in 2012.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030931', 'afid': '60030931', 'affilname': 'University of Oklahoma', 'affiliation-city': 'Norman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han J.', 'Chen J.', 'Xia J.', 'Li L.']","['55796896300', '8985856500', '23037516700', '56849678000']",Arid environment | Foliar damage | Phenotypic plasticity | Reproductive phenology,,undefined,,,1523628

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The ecosystems in Northern Eurasia (NE) play an important role in the global water cycle and the climate system. While evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical variable to understand this role, ET over this region remains largely unstudied. Using an improved version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model with five widely used forcing data sets, we examine the impact that uncertainties in climate forcing data have on the magnitude, variability, and dominant climatic drivers of ET for the period 1979-2008. Estimates of regional average ET vary in the range of 241.4-335.7mmyr-1 depending on the choice of forcing data. This range corresponds to as much as 32% of the mean ET. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of long-term average ET across NE are generally consistent for all forcing data sets. Our ET estimates in NE are largely affected by uncertainties in precipitation (P), air temperature (T), incoming shortwave radiation (R), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). During the growing season, the correlations between ET and each forcing variable indicate that T is the dominant factor in the north and P in the south. Unsurprisingly, the uncertainties in climate forcing data propagate as well to estimates of the volume of water available for runoff (here defined as P-ET). While the Climate Research Unit data set is overall the best choice of forcing data in NE according to our assessment, the quality of these forcing data sets remains a major challenge to accurately quantify the regional water balance in NE.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110457', 'afid': '60110457', 'affilname': 'Institute of Forest Science, Russian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Uspenskoe', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103885', 'afid': '60103885', 'affilname': 'Sukachev Institute of Forest of the Siberian Branch of the RAS', 'affiliation-city': 'Krasnoyarsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033316', 'afid': '60033316', 'affilname': 'Universiteit Gent', 'affiliation-city': 'Ghent', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028629', 'afid': '60028629', 'affilname': 'College of Science', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028402', 'afid': '60028402', 'affilname': 'Ecosystems Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551', 'afid': '60013551', 'affilname': 'China Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254', 'afid': '60009254', 'affilname': 'Purdue University', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008734', 'afid': '60008734', 'affilname': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007174', 'afid': '60007174', 'affilname': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liu Y.', 'Zhuang Q.', 'Miralles D.', 'Pan Z.', 'Kicklighter D.', 'Zhu Q.', 'He Y.', 'Chen J.', 'Tchebakova N.', 'Sirin A.', 'Niyogi D.', 'Melillo J.']","['55742038700', '8072265400', '36061813500', '8251952200', '6603810350', '56583139400', '55797749000', '8985856500', '16445196200', '7003277875', '57203474131', '7004628271']",,NSF,NSF-1028291,National Science Foundation,,1523628

Northern Eurasian ecosystems play an important role in the global climate system. Northern Eurasia (NE) has experienced dramatic climate changes during the last half of the 20th century and to present. To date, how evapotranspiration (ET) and water availability (P–ET, P: precipitation) had changed in response to the climatic change in this region has not been well evaluated. This study uses an improved version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) that explicitly considers ET from uplands, wetlands, water bodies and snow cover to examine temporal and spatial variations in ET, water availability and river discharge in NE for the period 1948–2009. The average ET over NE increased during the study period at a rate of 0.13 mm year−1 year−1. Over this time, water availability augmented in the western part of the region, but decreased in the eastern part. The consideration of snow sublimation substantially improved the ET estimates and highlighted the importance of snow in the hydrometeorology of NE. We also find that the modified TEM estimates of water availability in NE watersheds are in good agreement with corresponding measurements of historical river discharge before 1970. However, a systematic underestimation of river discharge occurs after 1970 indicates that other water sources or dynamics not considered by the model (e.g., melting glaciers, permafrost thawing and fires) may also be important for the hydrology of the region.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110457', 'afid': '60110457', 'affilname': 'Institute of Forest Science, Russian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Uspenskoe', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103885', 'afid': '60103885', 'affilname': 'Sukachev Institute of Forest of the Siberian Branch of the RAS', 'affiliation-city': 'Krasnoyarsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033316', 'afid': '60033316', 'affilname': 'Universiteit Gent', 'affiliation-city': 'Ghent', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028629', 'afid': '60028629', 'affilname': 'College of Science', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028402', 'afid': '60028402', 'affilname': 'Ecosystems Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020650', 'afid': '60020650', 'affilname': 'University of Bristol', 'affiliation-city': 'Bristol', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551', 'afid': '60013551', 'affilname': 'China Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254', 'afid': '60009254', 'affilname': 'Purdue University', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liu Y.', 'Zhuang Q.', 'Pan Z.', 'Miralles D.', 'Tchebakova N.', 'Kicklighter D.', 'Chen J.', 'Sirin A.', 'He Y.', 'Zhou G.', 'Melillo J.']","['55742038700', '8072265400', '8251952200', '36061813500', '16445196200', '6603810350', '8985856500', '7003277875', '55797749000', '7403686091', '7004628271']",,NSF,0919331,National Science Foundation,,1523628

By applying the concept of the coupled natural and human system (CNH), we compared spatiotemporal changes in livestock (LSK), land cover, and ecosystem production to understand the relative roles that natural and social driving forces have on CNH dynamics on the Mongolia plateau. We used socioeconomic and physical data at prefecture level for Inner Mongolia and Mongolia from 1981 through 2010 to represent changes in net primary productivity (NPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), precipitation, annual average temperature, LSK, livestock density (LSKD), land cover change (LCC), gross domestic production (GDP), and population (POP). The ratios such as LSK: NPP, LSKD: EVI, LSKD:albedo, LSK:POP, and LSK:GDP were examined and compared between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to quantify the complex interactions. Substantial differences in LSK, POP, and economic development were found among the biomes and between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. When various indicators for policy shifts - such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) for China, the Third Campaign to Reclaim Abandoned Agriculture Lands (ATAR-3), and the Grain for Green Program for China (GFG) - were added into our SEM, the results showed significant change in the strength of the above relationships. After China joined the WTO, the relationships in Inner Mongolia between LSKD:LCC and LSKD: NPP were immensely strengthened, whereas relationships in NPP:LCC were weakened. In Mongolia, the ATAR-3 program first appeared to be an insignificant policy, but the Collapse of the Soviet Union enhanced the correlation between LSKD:LCC, weakened the connection of LCC:NPP, and did not affect LSKD:NPP. We conclude that human influences on the Mongolian CNH system exceeded those of the biophysical changes, but that the significance varies in time and per biome, as well as between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia.",34,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119216', 'afid': '60119216', 'affilname': 'University of the Humanities', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chen J.', 'John R.', 'Shao C.', 'Fan Y.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Amarjargal A.', 'Brown D.G.', 'Qi J.', 'Han J.', 'Lafortezza R.', 'Dong G.']","['8985856500', '23970517000', '24336312100', '56693370600', '8693543800', '56668753300', '56975641800', '7201522137', '55796896300', '14421241900', '48761185400']",Coupled natural and human system | Global change | Land use | Mongolia | Policy | SEM,NSF,#1313761,National Science Foundation,,1523628

Quantifying the surface energy fluxes of grazed and ungrazed steppes is essential to understand the roles of grasslands in local and global climate and in land use change. We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010-2012). Near 95% of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5% at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared ~50% of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn - G) and H indicated a ""cooling effect"" feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shao C.', 'Chen J.', 'Li L.', 'Dong G.', 'Han J.', 'Abraha M.', 'John R.']","['24336312100', '8985856500', '56849678000', '48761185400', '55796896300', '13008527200', '23970517000']",available energy | cooling effect | ecosystem function | ecosystem stability | eddy-covariance | energy balance | energy partitioning | land use change | latent heat | net radiation | sensible heat | soil heat,,undefined,,,1523628

Forests play an important role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and mitigating the greenhouse effect. The Grain to Green Program (GGP) is one of the largest ecological programs in China, and it aims at converting croplands on steep slopes to forests. However, the magnitude and distribution of carbon sequestration induced by GGP remain unknown. In this study, we estimated the changes in carbon fluxes and stocks caused by forests converted from croplands under the GGP using a process-based ecosystem model (i.e., IBIS). Our results showed that the converted areas from croplands to forests under the GGP program could sequester 110.45 Tg C by 2020, and 524.36 Tg C by the end of this century. The sequestration capacity showed substantial spatial variations with large sequestration in southern China. The economic benefits of carbon sequestration from the GGP were also estimated according to the current carbon price. The estimated economic benefits ranged from $8.84 to $44.20 billion from 2000 through 2100, which may exceed the current total investment ($38.99 billion) on the program. As the GGP program continues and forests grow, the impact of this program will be even larger in the future, making a more considerable contribution to China’s carbon sink over the upcoming decades.",53,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237', 'afid': '60023237', 'affilname': 'Beijing Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liu D.', 'Chen Y.', 'Cai W.', 'Dong W.', 'Xiao J.', 'Chen J.', 'Zhang H.', 'Xia J.', 'Yuan W.']","['57125072600', '55500618200', '55187835600', '57139379600', '8530104100', '8985856500', '55239849500', '55710865800', '8562505600']",Carbon sequestration | Carbon sink | Grain to Green Program | Integrated biosphere simulator | Modeling,NCET,41322005,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University,,1523628

A nested random block design was employed in 2012, with historical grazing as the block factor and precipitation as a nested factor, to explore the regulatory mechanisms on the carbon fluxes in a desert steppe. This long-term grazing practice had exerted unique legacy effects on community composition through increasing the proportion of Stipa breviflora Griseb. (Pstipa) by 61.53%, and decreasing species richness (Rsp) by 30.70%, cover by 21.87%, aboveground biomass (AGB) by 31.34%, and carbon allocation (the ratio of ANPP/BNPP) by 15.18%. Moreover, plants had differential adaptations to herbivores. Remarkably, these grazing legacies indirectly promoted plant photosynthesis (GEE) and carbon gain (NEE). Precipitation, as expected, accounted for the variability of GEE by 43% and NEE by 33%. The results revealed that precipitation controlled the magnitude of carbon fluxes while grazing legacies offset the adverse effects of current grazing and, therefore, mediated carbon sequestration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028205', 'afid': '60028205', 'affilname': 'Neimenggu Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Hohhot', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021624', 'afid': '60021624', 'affilname': 'The University of Toledo', 'affiliation-city': 'Toledo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112899003', 'afid': '112899003', 'affilname': 'Inner Mongolia Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han J.', 'Chen J.', 'Han G.', 'Shao C.', 'Sun H.', 'Li L.']","['55796896300', '8985856500', '27172263600', '24336312100', '56118881200', '56849678000']",Carbon exchange | Precipitation | Semi-arid region | Vegetative traits,NUIST,XDA05050402,Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0140196314000743,1523628

Quantifying the surface energy fluxes of grazed and ungrazed steppes is essential to understand the roles of grasslands in local and global climate and in land use change. We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010-2012). Near 95% of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5% at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared ~50% of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn - G) and H indicated a ""cooling effect"" feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year.

We selected six cities on the Mongolian Plateau, classified their urban built-up areas using Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) from 1990 through 2015, and examined the driving forces of urbanization (i.e., economy, social goods, and environmental variables) through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). We found that the spatial characteristics of urbanization in IM and MG have both similarities and differences. The cities in IM and MG have experienced rapid urban expansion, with urban areas increasing by 4.36 times and 3.12 times, respectively, since 1990. Cities in IM, however, were less dense and more sprawling whereas cities in MG were linearly aggregated. We also found through PLS-SEM that multiple driving forces affected urbanization in IM and MG during the transitional period. Results (path coef.) demonstrated that economic development (0.559) is a major driver for urbanization in IM, whereas social goods (0.646) and economic development (0.433) strongly influence urbanization in MG.

Background: Companioned by economic development, a dietary shift toward higher meat consumption is seen in developing countries and transitional economies, where the demand for livestock production has been increasing in response to such a dietary shift. In the Asian Dryland Belt, approaches to meet this demand have focused on grazing intensification, cropland conversion for animal feed, and supplemental feeding. With the scarcity of water, energy, and food in the region, a key question is whether or not the current approaches are sustainable. If not, what are the pathways to increase livestock production while protecting the region’s environment for a sustainable future? We provide our reviews and discuss current approaches in response to these dietary shifts and assess their environmental resilience with a focus on the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Results: While current approaches alleviate the urgent need for short-term livestock production, they lead to long-term vulnerability in food security. Trade-offs between short gains and long-term losses, between food for humans and for animals, and between agricultural intensification and environmental degradation need to be holistically examined for the sustainable development of the region. A grassland water, energy, and food nexus framework is proposed with specific recommendations to increase livestock production while considering other ecosystem services of the dryland grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Conclusions: Current practices to increase livestock production are likely to lead to long-term, large-scale ecological degradation of the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt and are thus unsustainable. By considering the trade-offs in the nexus of water, land, food, and livelihoods, sustainable pathways were articulated and recommended.

The resource-driven concept, which is an important school for investigating ecosystem production, has been applied for decades. However, the regulatory mechanisms of production by multiple resources remain unclear. We formulated a new algorithm model that integrates multiple resource uses to study ecosystem production and tested its applications on a water-availability gradient in semi-arid grassland. The result of our experiment showed that changes in water availability significantly affected the resources of light and nitrogen, and altered the relationships among multiple resource absorption rate (ϵ), multiple resource use efficiency (mRUE), and available resource (R avail). The increased water availability suppressed ecosystem mRUE (i.e., ""declining marginal returns""); The changes in mRUE had a negative effect on ϵ (i.e., ""inverse feedback""). These two processes jointly regulated that the stimulated single resource availability would promote ecosystem production rather than suppress it, even when mRUE was reduced. This study illustrated the use of the mRUE model in exploring the coherent relationships among the key parameters on regulating the ecosystem production for future modeling, and evaluated the sensitivity of this conceptual model under different dataset properties.

Background: As a consequence of global change, intensity and frequency of extreme events such as heat waves (HW) have been increasing worldwide. Methods: By using a combination of continuous 60-year meteorological and 6-year tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, we constructed a clear picture of a HWs effect on the dynamics of carbon, water, and vegetation on the Eurasian Songnen meadow steppe. Results: The number of HWs in the Songnen meadow steppe began increasing since the 1980s and the rate of occurrence has advanced since the 2010s to higher than ever before. HWs can reduce the grassland carbon flux, while net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) will regularly fluctuate for 4-5 days during the HW before decreasing. However, ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) decline from the beginning of the HW until the end, where Re and GEP will decrease 30% and 50%, respectively. When HWs last five days, water-use efficiency (WUE) will decrease by 26%, soil water content (SWC) by 30% and soil water potential (SWP) will increase by 38%. In addition, the soil temperature will still remain high after the HW although the air temperature will recover to its previous state. Conclusions: HWs, as an extreme weather event, have increased during the last two decades in the Songnen meadow steppe. HWs will reduce the carbon flux of the steppe and will cause a sustained impact. Drought may be the main reason why HWs decrease carbon flux. At the later stages of or after a HW, the ecosystem usually lacks water and the soil becomes so hot and dry that it prevents roots from absorbing enough water to maintain their metabolism. This is the main reason why this grassland carbon exchange decreases during and after HWs.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009509', 'afid': '60009509', 'affilname': 'Northeast Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Changchun', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qu L.', 'Chen J.', 'Dong G.', 'Jiang S.', 'Li L.', 'Guo J.', 'Shao C.']","['56861693900', '8985856500', '48761185400', '7404452114', '56849678000', '55644882200', '24336312100']",Carbon flux | Eddy covariance | Extreme climate | Global change | Grassland | Temperature,NASA,NNX14AD85G,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0013935115300736,1523628

Grazing profoundly influences vegetation and the subsequent carbon fluxes in various ecosystems. However, little effort has been made to explore the underlying mechanisms for phenological changes and their consequences on carbon fluxes at ecosystem level, especially under the coupled influences of human disturbances and climate change. Here, a manipulative experiment (2012-2013) was conducted to examine both the independent and interactive effects of grazing and watering on carbon fluxes across phenological phases in a desert steppe. Grazing advanced or delayed phenological timing, leading to a shortened green-up phase (GrP: 23.60 days) in 2013 and browning phase (BrP: 12.48 days) in 2012 from high grazing, and insignificant effects on the reproductive phase (ReP) in either year. High grazing significantly enhance carbon uptake, while light grazing reduce carbon uptake in ReP. Watering only delayed the browning time by 5.01 days in 2013, producing no significant effects on any phenophase. Watering promoted the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) only in the GrP. When calculating the yearly differences in phenophases and the corresponding carbon fluxes, we found that an extended GrP greatly enhanced NEE, but a prolonged ReP distinctly reduced it. The extended GrP also significantly promote GEP. Increases in growing season length appeared promoting ER, regardless of any phenophase. Additionally, the shifts in NEE appeared dependent of the variations in leaf area index (LAI).",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121458', 'afid': '60121458', 'affilname': 'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003146', 'afid': '60003146', 'affilname': 'Henan University', 'affiliation-city': 'Kaifeng', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han J.', 'Li L.', 'Chu H.', 'Miao Y.', 'Chen S.', 'Chen J.']","['55796896300', '56849678000', '55220380900', '56591493900', '26031336300', '8985856500']",Carbon | Desert steppe | Grazing | Human disturbances | Phenology | Water,NSF,1313761,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0013935115300748,1523628

As a consequence of the global increase in economic and societal prosperity, ecosystems and natural resources have been substantially exploited, degraded, or even destroyed in the last century. To prevent further deprivation of the quality of ecosystems, the ecosystem services concept has become a central issue in environmental studies. A growing number of environmental agencies and organizations worldwide are now embracing integrated approaches to plan and manage ecosystems, sharing a goal to maintain the long-term provision of ecosystem services for sustainability. A daunting challenge in this process is to move from general pronouncements about the tremendous benefits that ecosystems provide to society to defensible assessments of their services. In other words, we must move beyond the scientific evidences of the ecosystem services concept to its practical applications. In this work, we discuss the theoretical foundations and applications of ecosystem services with a focus on the assessment of ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies at various spatial and temporal scales. Here, we offer examples of the main factors related to land use management that may affect the provision of ecosystem services and provide direction for future research on ecosystem services and related nature-based solutions. We also provide a briefing on the major topics covered in this Special Issue, which focuses on the provision of ecosystem services in the context of global change.",38,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lafortezza R.', 'Chen J.']","['14421241900', '8985856500']",Ecosystem services | Environmental resources | Global change | Landscape-Scale modeling | Nature-Based Solutions,,undefined,Michigan State University,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S001393511600013X,1523628

Context: The Mongolian Plateau, comprising Inner Mongolia, China (IM) and Mongolia (MG) is undergoing consistent warming and accelerated land cover/land use change. Extensive modifications of water-limited regions can alter ecosystem function and processes; hence, it is important to differentiate the impacts of human activities and precipitation dynamics on vegetation productivity. Objectives: This study distinguished between human-induced and precipitation-driven changes in vegetation cover on the plateau across biome, vegetation type and administrative divisions. Methods: Non-parametric trend tests were applied to the time series of vegetation indices (VI) derived from MODIS and AVHRR and precipitation from TRMM and MERRA reanalysis data. VI residuals adjusted for rainfall were obtained from the regression between growing season maximum VI and monthly accumulated rainfall (June–August) and were used to detect human-induced trends in vegetation productivity during 1981–2010. The total livestock and population density trends were identified and then used to explain the VI residual trends. Results: The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were negatively correlated to total livestock density (R2 = 0.59 and 0.16, p < 0.05) in MG and positively correlated with total population density (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.05) in IM. The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were also negatively correlated with goat density (R2 = 0.59 and 0.19, p < 0.05) and sheep density in MG (R2 = 0.59 and 0.13, p < 0.05) but not in IM. Conclusions: Some administrative subdivisions in IM and MG showed decreasing trends in VI residuals. These trends could be attributed to increasing livestock or population density and changes in livestock herd composition. Other subdivisions showed increasing trends residuals, suggesting that the vegetation cover increase could be attributed to conservation efforts.",48,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119216', 'afid': '60119216', 'affilname': 'University of the Humanities', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072642', 'afid': '60072642', 'affilname': 'Mongolian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022355', 'afid': '60022355', 'affilname': 'University of Montana', 'affiliation-city': 'Missoula', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['John R.', 'Chen J.', 'Kim Y.', 'Ou-yang Z.t.', 'Xiao J.', 'Park H.', 'Shao C.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Amarjargal A.', 'Batkhshig O.', 'Qi J.']","['23970517000', '8985856500', '55699587100', '55880999200', '8530104100', '56799345700', '24336312100', '8693543800', '56668753300', '56801105900', '7201522137']",EVI | EVI2 | GIMMS3 g NDVI | Livestock density | MODIS | Mongolian Plateau | Population density | Precipitation | RESTREND | Semi-arid | Vegetation indices,NSF,1313761,National Science Foundation,,1523628

By applying the concept of the coupled natural and human system (CNH), we compared spatiotemporal changes in livestock (LSK), land cover, and ecosystem production to understand the relative roles that natural and social driving forces have on CNH dynamics on the Mongolia plateau. We used socioeconomic and physical data at prefecture level for Inner Mongolia and Mongolia from 1981 through 2010 to represent changes in net primary productivity (NPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), precipitation, annual average temperature, LSK, livestock density (LSKD), land cover change (LCC), gross domestic production (GDP), and population (POP). The ratios such as LSK: NPP, LSKD: EVI, LSKD:albedo, LSK:POP, and LSK:GDP were examined and compared between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to quantify the complex interactions. Substantial differences in LSK, POP, and economic development were found among the biomes and between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. When various indicators for policy shifts - such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) for China, the Third Campaign to Reclaim Abandoned Agriculture Lands (ATAR-3), and the Grain for Green Program for China (GFG) - were added into our SEM, the results showed significant change in the strength of the above relationships. After China joined the WTO, the relationships in Inner Mongolia between LSKD:LCC and LSKD: NPP were immensely strengthened, whereas relationships in NPP:LCC were weakened. In Mongolia, the ATAR-3 program first appeared to be an insignificant policy, but the Collapse of the Soviet Union enhanced the correlation between LSKD:LCC, weakened the connection of LCC:NPP, and did not affect LSKD:NPP. We conclude that human influences on the Mongolian CNH system exceeded those of the biophysical changes, but that the significance varies in time and per biome, as well as between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia.",34,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119216', 'afid': '60119216', 'affilname': 'University of the Humanities', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chen J.', 'John R.', 'Shao C.', 'Fan Y.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Amarjargal A.', 'Brown D.G.', 'Qi J.', 'Han J.', 'Lafortezza R.', 'Dong G.']","['8985856500', '23970517000', '24336312100', '56693370600', '8693543800', '56668753300', '56975641800', '7201522137', '55796896300', '14421241900', '48761185400']",Coupled natural and human system | Global change | Land use | Mongolia | Policy | SEM,NSF,#1313761,National Science Foundation,,1523628

Primary data from 262 pastoral households in Inner Mongolia are analyzed to determine the effects of a subsidy for grassland protection on livestock numbers, grazing intensity, and herders' income. Econometric models are estimated to determine the effects of the subsidy on each component of the intensity ratio (sheep-equivalent livestock units and grassland). Results suggest the subsidy increased the quantity of grassland controlled by the household. However, the effects on livestock units are mixed, with two of the four studied prefectures (Ordos and Ulanqab) showing a positive response, and two (Hulunbuir and Xilingol) showing a negative response. Inserting the parameter estimates from the livestock, grassland, and income functions into a structural model of grazing intensity, results suggest each 1% increase in subsidy reduces grazing intensity by between 0.168% and 0.532% depending on the prefecture, and increases herders' income by between 0.144% and 0.670%. By way of comparison, each additional year of education increases herders' income by 8.7% and reduces grazing intensity by 3.6%.

Here, we quantified yearly anomalies of seasonal and annual NEP, net carbon uptake period (CUP), and the maximum daily NEP (NEPmax) in response to climatic variables in 24 deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), evergreen forest (EF), and grassland (GRA) ecosystems that include at least eight years of eddy covariance observations. Over the 228 site-years studied, interannual variations in NEP were mostly explained by anomalies of CUP and NEPmax. CUP was determined by spring and autumn net carbon uptake phenology, which were sensitive to annual meteorological variability. Warmer spring temperatures led to an earlier start of net carbon uptake activity and higher spring and annual NEP values in DBF and EF, while warmer autumn temperatures in DBF, higher autumn radiation in EF, and more summer and autumn precipitation in GRA resulted in a later ending date of net carbon uptake and associated higher autumn and annual NEP. Anomalies in NEPmax s were determined by summer precipitation in DBF and GRA, and explained more than 50% of variation in summer NEP anomalies for all the three biomes.

Accurate estimation of latent heat flux (LE) is critical in characterizing semiarid ecosystems. Many LE algorithms have been developed during the past few decades. However, the algorithms have not been directly compared, particularly over global semiarid ecosystems. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five LE models over semiarid ecosystems such as grassland, shrub, and savanna using the Fluxnet dataset of 68 eddy covariance (EC) sites during the period 2000-2009. We also used a modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications (MERRA) dataset, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Fractional Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, the leaf area index (LAI) from the global land surface satellite (GLASS) products, and the digital elevation model (DEM) from shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM30) dataset to generate LE at region scale during the period 2003-2006. The models were the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LE (MOD16) algorithm, revised remote sensing based Penman-monteith LE algorithm (RRS), the Priestley-taylor le algorithm of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL), the modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor LE algorithm (MS-PT), and the semi-empirical Penman LE algorithm (UMD).

Empirical parameters in the structure algorithms of MOD16 and RRS, and calibrated coefficients of the UMD algorithm may be the cause of the reduced performance of these LE algorithms with R2 ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 and RMSE ranging from 20 to 35 W/m2 for MOD16, RRS and UMD.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The ecosystems in Northern Eurasia (NE) play an important role in the global water cycle and the climate system. While evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical variable to understand this role, ET over this region remains largely unstudied. Using an improved version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model with five widely used forcing data sets, we examine the impact that uncertainties in climate forcing data have on the magnitude, variability, and dominant climatic drivers of ET for the period 1979-2008. Estimates of regional average ET vary in the range of 241.4-335.7mmyr-1 depending on the choice of forcing data. This range corresponds to as much as 32% of the mean ET. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of long-term average ET across NE are generally consistent for all forcing data sets. Our ET estimates in NE are largely affected by uncertainties in precipitation (P), air temperature (T), incoming shortwave radiation (R), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). During the growing season, the correlations between ET and each forcing variable indicate that T is the dominant factor in the north and P in the south. Unsurprisingly, the uncertainties in climate forcing data propagate as well to estimates of the volume of water available for runoff (here defined as P-ET). While the Climate Research Unit data set is overall the best choice of forcing data in NE according to our assessment, the quality of these forcing data sets remains a major challenge to accurately quantify the regional water balance in NE.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110457', 'afid': '60110457', 'affilname': 'Institute of Forest Science, Russian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Uspenskoe', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103885', 'afid': '60103885', 'affilname': 'Sukachev Institute of Forest of the Siberian Branch of the RAS', 'affiliation-city': 'Krasnoyarsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033316', 'afid': '60033316', 'affilname': 'Universiteit Gent', 'affiliation-city': 'Ghent', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028629', 'afid': '60028629', 'affilname': 'College of Science', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028402', 'afid': '60028402', 'affilname': 'Ecosystems Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551', 'afid': '60013551', 'affilname': 'China Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254', 'afid': '60009254', 'affilname': 'Purdue University', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008734', 'afid': '60008734', 'affilname': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'affiliation-city': 'Amsterdam', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007174', 'afid': '60007174', 'affilname': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liu Y.', 'Zhuang Q.', 'Miralles D.', 'Pan Z.', 'Kicklighter D.', 'Zhu Q.', 'He Y.', 'Chen J.', 'Tchebakova N.', 'Sirin A.', 'Niyogi D.', 'Melillo J.']","['55742038700', '8072265400', '36061813500', '8251952200', '6603810350', '56583139400', '55797749000', '8985856500', '16445196200', '7003277875', '57203474131', '7004628271']",,NSF,NSF-1028291,National Science Foundation,,1523628

The fencing poses challenges to both wildlife and the traditional pastoralism practised by Maasai communities, which were dependent on the presence of open communal land. The purpose of the article is to identify the root causes of the enclosure of former common land and the increasing fencing of plots of land owned by individual Maasai. The study is based on empirical material from extended fieldwork conducted in two villages adjacent to the reserve and a review of relevant documents. The main finding is that the history of land division, the introduction of wildlife conservancies, and the materialization of an ageold discourse about the ‘end of pastoralism’, through the process of privatization and commercialization of land, have played major roles in pushing the Maasai to fence their land. The authors conclude that fencing can be seen both as an active form of resistance to dispossession in the name of conservation and as evidence of the acceptance of the discourse on the ‘end of traditional pastoralism’, which has been promoted by a range of state and nonstate actors since Kenya gained independence from colonial rule.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013141', 'afid': '60013141', 'affilname': 'Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Trondheim', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}]",Journal,Article,"['Weldemichel T.', 'Lein H.']","['57209533657', '16637636300']",Exclusion | Group ranches | Marginalization | Neoliberalism | Pastoralism | Privatization | Territorialization,NTNU,undefined,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0264837718317058,1523628

Until 5,000 YBP there is no evidence of lasting human influences on ecosystems, but after this time, changes in vegetation and soil physical properties signal domestic livestock grazing impacts on steppe ecosystems. Contemporary (1991–2015) literature and region by region analysis of climate, livestock, remote-sensing and human population data reveal two potential tipping points. Temperatures warmed across the 5 regions. Since 1991, livestock densities and forage use increased in most regions, the spatial distribution of grazing pressure is more heterogeneous, and variability increased in stocking densities, forage use and forage production in all or most regions. Substantial plant species shifts and losses occurred in the mountain and forest steppe regions. Although a large proportion of Mongolia's rangelands are altered from their ecological potential, few have crossed an irreversible threshold of ecological change. Rangelands in Mongolia's Khangai, northern and central regions may be approaching an ecological tipping point if grazing pressure is not reduced. After 1991, herder populations initially rose and then decreased significantly across most regions. If demographic and social trends contribute to loss of herding knowledge and identity, a cultural tipping point could occur. We describe four potential future scenarios that could unfold if these tipping points are reached, hypothesize feedbacks between ecological and cultural thresholds, and discuss implications for policy and management.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025837', 'afid': '60025837', 'affilname': 'Blackland Research and Extension Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Temple', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Fernández-Giménez M.', 'Venable N.', 'Angerer J.', 'Fassnacht S.', 'Reid R.', 'Khishigbayar J.']","['6603129643', '55207053400', '8282209900', '6603909200', '7401758111', '56156979400']",Archaeology | Coupled human and natural system | Paleo-ecology | Pastoralism | Social-ecological system | Threshold,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2213305417300061,1523628

The study of social-ecological systems (SES) is an inherently interdisciplinary endeavor that necessitates collaboration among multiple researchers and stakeholders. These collaborations often result in novel insights into the dynamics and feedbacks that occur within these systems. Achieving these insights requires methods and tools that integrate diverse knowledge from multiple disciplines and sectors of society to inform actionable research on complex systems. Past research has demonstrated the contributions that stakeholders can make to defining scenarios that are subsequently applied to quantitative modeling. Here, we focus on the feedback from quantitative modeling to refinement and interpretation of scenarios, and demonstrate how quantitative modeling can reveal aspects of system dynamics that were not considered during scenario development. We present a case study in which we use qualitative scenario planning as a tool to engender systems thinking by a diverse set of stakeholders in a complex transboundary SES: the Mongolian Plateau. This exercise demonstrated the value of participatory scenario planning as a tool for facilitating interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral dialog and knowledge generation. It also ensured the integration of place-based knowledge into scenario development for subsequent quantitative modeling. In addition to incorporating stakeholder knowledge in simulation of complex human-environment dynamics, the quantitative modeling revealed how the dynamics of rural out-migration contribute to the decoupling of rural herder populations and livestock numbers. The emergent knowledge gained from this process underscores the utility of pairing the qualitative scenarios with quantitative simulations to reveal unanticipated system behavior and key drivers not identified or overlooked by stakeholders.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015481', 'afid': '60015481', 'affilname': 'University of Washington, Seattle', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003088', 'afid': '60003088', 'affilname': 'The George Washington University', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Allington G.R.H.', 'Fernandez-Gimenez M.E.', 'Chen J.', 'Brown D.G.']","['35316885800', '6603129643', '8985856500', '56975641800']",Mongolian Plateau | Scenario planning | System dynamics model,NSF,-1052875,National Science Foundation,,1523628

Context: Grasslands provide a variety of ecosystem services (ESs) for humans. While much ES research has focused on forests and wetlands, synthesizing the currently somewhat sporadic studies of grassland ecosystem services (GESs) is much needed. Objectives: We aimed to review the scope, major methods, and key findings of GESs, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles published during 1970–2018 (including 380 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science and 32 book chapters from Google Scholar). Results: The number of GES studies has accelerated in recent decades, with China (31%) and the United States (18%) together accounting for almost half of them. A total of 33 GESs were mentioned in the searched articles, of which carbon sequestration, forage production, and water erosion control had the highest frequencies. Methods for evaluating GESs include field survey, field experiments, and statistical and process-based modeling. Grasslands are the primary source of meat and dairy products, account for about one-third of the total carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, and provide numerous other ESs, such as night cooling, soil erosion control, and flood mitigation. Conclusions: This review presents the state-of-the-science of GESs, and identifies several future research directions. To move forward, we propose a framework with a 3-M methodology: (1) “Multi-scales”—understanding GESs from various spatiotemporal scales; (2) “Multi-methods”—evaluating GESs with multiple statistical and modeling techniques using multiple data sources; and (3) “Multi-perspectives”—assessing GESs from ecological, social, and economic perspectives for sustainability.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237', 'afid': '60023237', 'affilname': 'Beijing Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006782', 'afid': '60006782', 'affilname': 'Beijing Forestry University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhao Y.', 'Liu Z.', 'Wu J.']","['35207833900', '55714798200', '57216601714']",Cultural services | Grassland ecosystem services | Grassland sustainability | Provisioning services | Regulating services | Systematic review,NSFC,2014CB954303,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program),,1523628

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to test hypotheses about the effects of economic and weather factors on the inventories of cattle, sheep and goats in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR). Design/methodology/approach: An equilibrium displacement model of livestock products is combined with an inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) to deduce hypothesis about the effects of expected price and feed costs, weather, and supply and demand shifters on herd size. Dynamics are incorporated using the partial adjustment and adaptive expectations models originally proposed by Nerlove (1956). The hypotheses are tested using both the structural equations implied by the model, and the reduced form. Findings: Results suggest livestock inventories in IMAR in general are more responsive to weather conditions than to economic conditions. This is especially true for cattle and sheep, where isolated 1 percent changes in weather variables, namely precipitation and radiation, were found to have a much larger effect on inventory than isolated 1 percent changes in expected price and forage costs. The effects of the weather variables, moreover, were found to be different for goats than for cattle and sheep, with goat numbers decreasing with improvements in weather, and cattle and sheep numbers increasing. This suggests herders respond to poor weather in part by substituting goats for cattle and/or sheep. Price was found to have a negative effect on cattle inventory, and no effect on sheep and goat inventory. Forage costs were found to have a positive effect on cattle and sheep inventories, and no effect on goat inventory. These results suggest policies to protect grassland by controlling inventory levels must be designed carefully if they are to be effective. Originality/value: The paper makes a methodological contribution in that the livestock inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) is extended to include supply and demand shifters for livestock products in a partial-equilibrium setting where the industry in question is a net exporter of livestock products. The paper makes an empirical contribution in that additional evidence is provided on the role that price plays in inventory behavior.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024045', 'afid': '60024045', 'affilname': 'Nanjing Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ge W.', 'Kinnucan H.']","['57195488385', '6701811824']",Dynamics | Equilibrium displacement model | Inventories | Livestock,,undefined,,,1523628

Flux measurements based on aerodynamic principles (e.g., eddy covariance method, or EC) assume the vegetation and landform within the footprint must be flat, large, and homogeneous, although very rarely do flux tower sites meet such requirements. Here, using two long term EC tower sites in Mongolian grasslands, we test a hypothesis that the magnitude and variation of EC flux measurements are partially dependent of landscape heterogeneity. We define landscape heterogeneity as the spatial composition and distribution of components within the footprint of a flux tower, which was quantified using high resolution WorldView-2 images to extract vegetation texture features (Contrast, Dissimilarity and Entropy). Bayesian analysis was performed to model the linkage of landscape heterogeneity with EC fluxes of CO2 in 8 intercardinal directions by dissecting it into 5 distances. We found that higher levels of landscape heterogeneity have an impact on flux measurements, especially under stable conditions. Specifically, a total of 24 Bayesian models based on the EVI-derived texture features passed the Gelman and Rubin convergence diagnostic statistic test. A positive relationship is shown between the percentage of footprint cover (Footprint%sector) and landscape texture features (Contrast and Dissimilarity), with the footprint cover acting as a function of heterogeneity under stable conditions. Negative effects were found when modeling CO2 flux (Fcsector) with Contrast under stable and unstable conditions, and with Dissimilarity and Entropy under stable conditions. With increases in high resolution remote sensing images and UAV technology (e.g., LiDAR), the results and approaches outlined in this study highlight new frontiers and opportunities for the FLUXNET community to integrate flux measurements and high-resolution remote sensing data, promoting a new generation of footprint models, and exploring the cohesive connections between flux measurements and the underlying processes (e.g., soil, physiological, ecosystem processes).",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541', 'afid': '60006541', 'affilname': 'The University of Hong Kong', 'affiliation-city': 'Pokfulam', 'affiliation-country': 'Hong Kong'}]",Journal,Article,"['Giannico V.', 'Chen J.', 'Shao C.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'John R.', 'Lafortezza R.']","['56997375000', '8985856500', '24336312100', '36898804300', '23970517000', '14421241900']",Bayesian | Eddy covariance | Footprint | Landscape heterogeneity | Mongolia,NASA,NNX15AD10G,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168192318301898,1523628

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Variations in ecosystem composition and structure within a cover type of the same biome can be responsible for the large amounts of uncertainty in remote sensing modeling of aboveground biomass (AGB). Based on 820 ground measurements of AGB and the pure vegetation index models, we proposed a spatially variable remote sensing scalar (i.e., M scalar) in estimating AGB by addressing within-type variations of vegetation. We tested this new modeling approach in Inner Mongolia grasslands and achieved a higher R2 (>0.88) and lower RMSE value (<28.17 g/m2) than those in the conventional remote sensing models. The annual average (STD) of the grassland AGB for 2001–2016 was ~87 (±9) Tg, with an AGB density of 104 ± 74 g/m2. The interannual variation of AGB appeared insignificant over the study period, except in the western region where it increased significantly. The dynamics of AGB were highly correlated with drought severity during the growing season (R2 = 0.691, P < 0.001).

More importantly, the high grazing intensity played a less significant role in directing grassland AGB dynamics (R2 = 0.024, P = 0.599).

Across the Earth’s surface, climate change has been occurring at a non-uniform rate, affecting biomes and directly or indirectly imposing impacts on societies. The productivity of the grassland biome has also been inevitably influenced, which in turn might affect the livestock production. Here, a meaningful indicator – growth rate index (GRI) – is proposed based on plant phenology and quantified from long-term remote sensing data to understand responses of the grassland biome to climate change at a global scale. We found a steady increase in GRI for the global grassland biome from 1982 through 2013, with around 35% of global grasslands exhibiting a significant increase (p < 0.1), and 3.8% of global grasslands experiencing a decrease. Climate warming over the past three decades did not aggravate water stress on worldwide grassland biomes, especially for the typical steppes in the Northern Hemisphere where GRI appeared more sensitive to the variations in precipitation compared to the savanna biome in the Southern Hemisphere. This study suggests that the increases in grassland GRI may have the potential to elevate global livestock production.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027277', 'afid': '60027277', 'affilname': 'Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000264', 'afid': '60000264', 'affilname': 'Nagoya University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nagoya', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114308303', 'afid': '114308303', 'affilname': 'Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Environmental Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li F.', 'Zhang X.', 'Chen J.', 'Feng B.']","['57214075462', '36562756000', '8985856500', '57203913216']",,NSF,NIGLAS2016TD01,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,,1523628

Grazing effects on arid and semi-arid grasslands can be constrained by aridity. Plant functional groups (PFGs) are the most basic component of community structure (CS) and biodiversity & ecosystem function (BEF). They have been suggested as identity-dependent in quantifying the response to grazing intensity and drought severity. Here, we examine how the relationships among PFGs, CS, BEF, and grazing intensity are driven by climatic drought. We conducted a manipulative experiment with three grazing intensities in 2012 (nondrought year) and 2013 (drought year). We classified 62 herbaceous plants into four functional groups based on their life forms. We used the relative species abundance of PFGs to quantify the effects of grazing and drought, and to explore the mechanisms for the pathway correlations using structural equation models (SEM) among PFGs, CS, and BEF directly or indirectly. Grazers consistently favored the perennial forbs (e.g., palatable or nutritious plants), decreasing the plants' relative abundance by 23%-38%. Drought decreased the relative abundance of ephemeral plants by 42 ± 13%; and increased perennial forbs by 20 ± 7% and graminoids by 80 ± 31%. SEM confirmed that annuals and biennials had negative correlations with the other three PFGs, with perennial bunchgrasses facilitated by perennial rhizome grass. Moreover, the contributions of grazing to community structure (i.e., canopy height) were 1.6-6.1 times those from drought, whereas drought effect on community species richness was 3.6 times of the grazing treatment. Lastly, the interactive effects of grazing and drought on BEF were greater than either alone; particularly, drought escalated grazing damage on primary production. Synthesis. The responses of PFGs, CS, and BEF to grazing and drought were identity-dependent, suggesting that grazing and drought regulation of plant functional groups might be a way to shape ecosystem structure and function in grasslands.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121883276', 'afid': '121883276', 'affilname': 'School of Natural Resources and the Environment The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'Honduras'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121012475', 'afid': '121012475', 'affilname': 'School of Ecology and Environment Inner Mongolia University Hohhot China', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,,"['Liang M.', 'Chen J.', 'Gornish E.', 'Bai X.', 'Li Z.', 'Liang C.']","['56393727400', '8985856500', '35725305900', '57203130807', '56269028800', '15073826900']",Drought | Ecosystem function | Mongolian Plateau | Plant competition and facilitation | Plant functional group | Plant-climate interactions | Plant-herbivore interaction | Temperate grasslands,,undefined,,,1523628

In the context of socioeconomic and biophysical changes, our knowledge on these urbanization processes remains limited. Here, we used the Mongolian Plateau (i.e., Inner Mongolia (IM) and Mongolia (MG)) as a testbed and applied the coupled natural and human (CNH) concept to understand the processes and causes of urbanization. We selected six cities on the Mongolian Plateau, classified their urban built-up areas using Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) from 1990 through 2015, and examined the driving forces of urbanization (i.e., economy, social goods, and environmental variables) through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). We found that the spatial characteristics of urbanization in IM and MG have both similarities and differences. The cities in IM and MG have experienced rapid urban expansion, with urban areas increasing by 4.36 times and 3.12 times, respectively, since 1990. Cities in IM, however, were less dense and more sprawling whereas cities in MG were linearly aggregated. We also found through PLS-SEM that multiple driving forces affected urbanization in IM and MG during the transitional period. Results (path coef.) demonstrated that economic development (0.559) is a major driver for urbanization in IM, whereas social goods (0.646) and economic development (0.433) strongly influence urbanization in MG.

Background: Companioned by economic development, a dietary shift toward higher meat consumption is seen in developing countries and transitional economies, where the demand for livestock production has been increasing in response to such a dietary shift. In the Asian Dryland Belt, approaches to meet this demand have focused on grazing intensification, cropland conversion for animal feed, and supplemental feeding. With the scarcity of water, energy, and food in the region, a key question is whether or not the current approaches are sustainable. If not, what are the pathways to increase livestock production while protecting the region’s environment for a sustainable future? We provide our reviews and discuss current approaches in response to these dietary shifts and assess their environmental resilience with a focus on the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Results: While current approaches alleviate the urgent need for short-term livestock production, they lead to long-term vulnerability in food security. Trade-offs between short gains and long-term losses, between food for humans and for animals, and between agricultural intensification and environmental degradation need to be holistically examined for the sustainable development of the region. A grassland water, energy, and food nexus framework is proposed with specific recommendations to increase livestock production while considering other ecosystem services of the dryland grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Conclusions: Current practices to increase livestock production are likely to lead to long-term, large-scale ecological degradation of the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt and are thus unsustainable. By considering the trade-offs in the nexus of water, land, food, and livelihoods, sustainable pathways were articulated and recommended.

Yet field data based on sound experiment on the variation of ecosystem CO2 levels under HWs remain rare. Additionally, ecosystems react to HWs and the coupled human activities (such as grazing in grasslands) are unknown. Thus, a 3-year field experiment was conducted to simulate HWs in conjunction with different mowing intensities that mimicking grazing in a Stipa krylovii steppe on the Mongolian Plateau. HWs significantly decreased ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) by 31%, 5% and 16%, respectively, over the three years. Continuous HWs over multiple years produced cumulative effects by reducing NEE at 20%, 34% and 40% in the first, second and third HW years, respectively. During three pre-defined three periods of HWs (during HW period, after HW period in the same year, and after HW period in the next year), variations in water use efficiency indicated that the grassland ecosystem exhibited a strategy for adapting to the continuous HWs to a certain extent, by adjusting community structure or increasing litter biomass. Finally, mowing increased the effects of HWs by extending the legacy effect, such that restoration of the grassland required a greater amount of time under the combination of HWs and mowing.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004630', 'afid': '60004630', 'affilname': 'Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fuzhou', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qu L.', 'Chen J.', 'Dong G.', 'Shao C.']","['56861693900', '8985856500', '48761185400', '24336312100']",Carbon assimilation | Clipping | Ecosystem function | Extreme weather event | Global warming | Water use efficiency,NSF,720-16,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969718303425,1523628

The Tibetan Plateau has experienced higher-than-global-average climate warming in recent decades, resulting in many significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. Among them is albedo, which bridges the causes and consequences of land surface processes and climate. The plateau is covered by snow/ice and vegetation in the non-growing season (nGS) and growing season (GS), respectively.

A synchronous relationship was found between the change in GSNDVI and GSalbedo over time and across the Tibetan landscapes. We found that the annual average albedo had a decreasing trend, but that the albedo had slightly increased during the nGS and decreased during the GS. Across the landscapes, the nGSalbedo fluctuated in a synchronous pattern with snow/ice cover. Temporally, monthly snow/ice coverage also had a high correspondence with albedo, except in April and October. We detected clear dependencies of albedo on elevation. With the rise in altitude, the nGSalbedo decreased below 4000 m, but increased for elevations of 4500–5500 m. Above 5500 m, the nGSalbedo decreased, which was in accordance with the decreased amount of snow/ice coverage and the increased soil moisture on the plateau.

The Mongolian Plateau (MP) and Tibetan Plateau (TP) have experienced higher-than-global average warming in recent decades, resulting in many significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. Among them are the leaf area index (LAI) and albedo, which play a fundamental role in understanding many causes and consequences of land surface processes and climate.

Based on the MODIS products, we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of albedo(VIS, NIR and SHO) and LAI from 2000 through 2016. We found that there existed a general negative logarithmic relationship between LAI and three measures of albedo on both plateaus. No significant relationship was found for LAI-albedoNIR on the TP, due to more complex land surface canopy characteristics affected by the NIR reflection there. During 2000-2016, overall, annual mean LAI increased significantly by 119.40 × 103 km2 on the MP and by 28.35 × 103 km2 on the TP, while the decreased areas for annual mean albedoVIS were 585.59 × 103 km2 and 235.73 × 103 km2 on the MP and TP, respectively.

Here we assessed the effects of precipitation events on ecosystem carbon exchange following the precipitation events. Naturally occurring precipitation events and CO2 exchange were measured by applying an eddy covariance technique and meteorological tower between 2008 and 2010 in a desert grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicate that the accumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon was −11.08 gC⋅m−2, −15.62 gC⋅m−2 and 26.68 gC m−2 in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The magnitude and timing of precipitation controlled the variation in accumulative NEE. Summer and autumn precipitation produced stronger impacts than those in the spring. The desert grassland appeared more sensitive to precipitation than other grassland ecosystems, with a threshold of ∼1–2 mm precipitation. During the 3-year study period, EPEs significantly enhanced the carbon sink strength due to discrepant sensitivity of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) to precipitation events. NEE response time to EPE (TL) lasted 5–17 days. Total accumulative carbon was - 40.32 gC m−2, which was 91% more than the 3-year average of NEE during TL and 33% more than the growing season average. GEP and Reco were disproportionally promoted by 52% and 37% with EPEs during TL. A nonlinear equation (NEE = α + βte-γt) was developed with high confidence (R2 = 0.84) to model the changes of NEE following the precipitation event. The sensitivity response of carbon exchange processes to larger precipitation events suggests that the carbon sink strength of the Inner Mongolian desert grassland will be elevated with the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation. This study provides updated evidence regarding how precipitation events alter ecosystem carbon sequestration and helps mitigate the uncertainty when quantifying the carbon budget of a semi-arid ecosystem with a different future climate. Further studies are crucial to investigate the long-term responses of carbon exchange processes to variations in precipitation patterns and characterize the responses of biological components of the carbon balance following precipitation events.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073587', 'afid': '60073587', 'affilname': 'Henan University of Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Luoyang', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027451', 'afid': '60027451', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yuhui W.', 'Jiquan C.', 'Guangsheng Z.', 'Changliang S.', 'Jun C.', 'Yu W.', 'Jianmin S.']","['35209245200', '57202938836', '15848267900', '57202940348', '57202945476', '57202948701', '57202940172']",Accumulative NEE | Desert grassland | Ecosystem CO  exchange 2 | Extreme precipitation | Nonlinear equation,CSC,1313761,China Scholarship Council,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0959652618317578,1523628

We used a Two-Stage Dynamic Model to examine the dynamics of livestock in terms of sales, self-consumption, and stocking in Mongolia in recent decades. While Mongolian pastoralists remain largely in the subsistence economy stage, herders do respond to market factors such as current and expected prices, substitute food prices and debt to help guide their choices and behaviors to maximize the economic value of their livestock. Our results also find that the livestock is very vulnerable to natural disasters. Providing a better capital market and livestock market could be the most essential factor to facilitate the economic transition of Mongolia from a subsistence pastoral economy to a market economy and to increase the welfare of herders in Mongolia.

Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, has experienced unprecedented urbanization following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Lack in housing supply has led to an expansion of informal settlements, mostly in the form of Gers — portable tents used by nomads in Mongolian Plateau. These settlements now host approximately 45% of Ulaanbaatar's total population, resulting in some serious urban challenges (i.e., limited public services, waterborne diseases, and air pollution). However, there is a limited understanding on how these informal settlements have evolved because they have been constantly growing and changing over the past few decades. We conducted semi-structured interviews and applied remote sensing imagery to generate a comprehensive picture of informal settlements in Ulaanbaatar over the past three decades. Throughout the semi-structured interviews, we identified informal settlements as evolving objects with infancy, consolidation, and maturity stages. Through QuickBird and Landsat satellite imagery, we developed spatial distributions of informal settlements from 1990 to 2013 and found the total area of informal settlements increased from 32.15 km2 to 221.15 km2. We identified distinct spatial patterns of informal settlements (i.e., spillover, linear aggregation, leap-frogging, and infill development). Particularly, we verified that the emergence of informal settlements in the infancy stage occurred in the periphery of the city and along major roads, with informal settlements rapidly evolving over time (i.e., about 40% of infancy-stage in 1990 had segued into the consolidation and maturity stages in 2013). These results are credited to the accessibility of economic opportunities and public services, as well as the availability of vacant land and associated unique Mongolian land tenure law.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121512', 'afid': '60121512', 'affilname': 'School of Global Policy and Strategy', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028179', 'afid': '60028179', 'affilname': 'University of South Dakota', 'affiliation-city': 'Vermillion', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Park H.', 'Fan P.', 'John R.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'Chen J.']","['57193776863', '24465046600', '23970517000', '36898804300', '8985856500']",Ger | Global South | Informal settlements | Mongolia | Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA),NASA,1313761,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169204618310351,1523628

By applying the concept of the coupled natural and human system (CNH), we compared spatiotemporal changes in livestock (LSK), land cover, and ecosystem production to understand the relative roles that natural and social driving forces have on CNH dynamics on the Mongolia plateau. We used socioeconomic and physical data at prefecture level for Inner Mongolia and Mongolia from 1981 through 2010 to represent changes in net primary productivity (NPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), precipitation, annual average temperature, LSK, livestock density (LSKD), land cover change (LCC), gross domestic production (GDP), and population (POP). The ratios such as LSK: NPP, LSKD: EVI, LSKD:albedo, LSK:POP, and LSK:GDP were examined and compared between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to quantify the complex interactions. Substantial differences in LSK, POP, and economic development were found among the biomes and between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. When various indicators for policy shifts - such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) for China, the Third Campaign to Reclaim Abandoned Agriculture Lands (ATAR-3), and the Grain for Green Program for China (GFG) - were added into our SEM, the results showed significant change in the strength of the above relationships. After China joined the WTO, the relationships in Inner Mongolia between LSKD:LCC and LSKD: NPP were immensely strengthened, whereas relationships in NPP:LCC were weakened. In Mongolia, the ATAR-3 program first appeared to be an insignificant policy, but the Collapse of the Soviet Union enhanced the correlation between LSKD:LCC, weakened the connection of LCC:NPP, and did not affect LSKD:NPP. We conclude that human influences on the Mongolian CNH system exceeded those of the biophysical changes, but that the significance varies in time and per biome, as well as between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia.",34,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119216', 'afid': '60119216', 'affilname': 'University of the Humanities', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chen J.', 'John R.', 'Shao C.', 'Fan Y.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Amarjargal A.', 'Brown D.G.', 'Qi J.', 'Han J.', 'Lafortezza R.', 'Dong G.']","['8985856500', '23970517000', '24336312100', '56693370600', '8693543800', '56668753300', '56975641800', '7201522137', '55796896300', '14421241900', '48761185400']",Coupled natural and human system | Global change | Land use | Mongolia | Policy | SEM,NSF,#1313761,National Science Foundation,,1523628

Few studies have addressed the potential grazing effects on microclimate, such as surface temperature and moisture, and their feedback effects on grassland function. A continuous, approximately three-year long study was conducted in experimental plots of various grazing intensities, and in situ soil temperature and moisture were measured. The results indicated that grazing significantly altered soil temperature and moisture. Soil temperature increased exponentially with increasing grazing intensity in the warm season due to the removal of aboveground biomass (AGB) and decreased linearly with increasing grazing intensity in the cold season due to decreases in both AGB and wind-blown snow accumulation. Heavy grazing increased soil temperature (10 cm depth) by an average of 2.6 °C from April to October (the largest hourly temperature increase was 8.8 °C), representing a soil warming effect 3.7 times that of global warming. Our findings showed that, compared with ungrazed plots, grazed plots had decreased soil water storage due to less winter snow accumulation, especially in the early growing season (EGS) because of the smaller amount of winter snow accumulation than in ungrazed plots. In the EGS, the average water storage in the 0–100 cm layer of the ungrazed plots was 23.3%, which was 1.3–1.8 times that of the grazed plots. Our results showed that grazing also produced warming and drying effects on grassland soil. The long-term feedback effects of grazing-induced soil warming and drying on the ecosystem might be an important mechanism accelerating the degradation and desertification of these grasslands.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028333', 'afid': '60028333', 'affilname': 'University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Sydney', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120836558', 'afid': '120836558', 'affilname': 'Xilinhot National Climate Observatory', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118681748', 'afid': '118681748', 'affilname': 'College of Science Inner Mongolia Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Yan Y.', 'Yan R.', 'Chen J.', 'Xin X.', 'Eldridge D.', 'Shao C.', 'Wang X.', 'Lv S.', 'Jin D.', 'Chen J.', 'Guo Z.', 'Chen B.', 'Xu L.']","['24330141500', '35263075300', '8985856500', '16317691300', '7006319477', '24336312100', '56084234300', '55428835000', '57195380490', '57202512930', '57202510584', '55510316300', '57188930427']",Grazing | Inner Mongolia | Meadow steppe | Soil moisture | Soil temperature,MOA,"821-1,821-32",Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168192318302326,1523628

Flux measurements based on aerodynamic principles (e.g., eddy covariance method, or EC) assume the vegetation and landform within the footprint must be flat, large, and homogeneous, although very rarely do flux tower sites meet such requirements. Here, using two long term EC tower sites in Mongolian grasslands, we test a hypothesis that the magnitude and variation of EC flux measurements are partially dependent of landscape heterogeneity. We define landscape heterogeneity as the spatial composition and distribution of components within the footprint of a flux tower, which was quantified using high resolution WorldView-2 images to extract vegetation texture features (Contrast, Dissimilarity and Entropy). Bayesian analysis was performed to model the linkage of landscape heterogeneity with EC fluxes of CO2 in 8 intercardinal directions by dissecting it into 5 distances. We found that higher levels of landscape heterogeneity have an impact on flux measurements, especially under stable conditions. Specifically, a total of 24 Bayesian models based on the EVI-derived texture features passed the Gelman and Rubin convergence diagnostic statistic test. A positive relationship is shown between the percentage of footprint cover (Footprint%sector) and landscape texture features (Contrast and Dissimilarity), with the footprint cover acting as a function of heterogeneity under stable conditions. Negative effects were found when modeling CO2 flux (Fcsector) with Contrast under stable and unstable conditions, and with Dissimilarity and Entropy under stable conditions. With increases in high resolution remote sensing images and UAV technology (e.g., LiDAR), the results and approaches outlined in this study highlight new frontiers and opportunities for the FLUXNET community to integrate flux measurements and high-resolution remote sensing data, promoting a new generation of footprint models, and exploring the cohesive connections between flux measurements and the underlying processes (e.g., soil, physiological, ecosystem processes).",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541', 'afid': '60006541', 'affilname': 'The University of Hong Kong', 'affiliation-city': 'Pokfulam', 'affiliation-country': 'Hong Kong'}]",Journal,Article,"['Giannico V.', 'Chen J.', 'Shao C.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'John R.', 'Lafortezza R.']","['56997375000', '8985856500', '24336312100', '36898804300', '23970517000', '14421241900']",Bayesian | Eddy covariance | Footprint | Landscape heterogeneity | Mongolia,NASA,NNX15AD10G,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168192318301898,1523628

Grazing effects on arid and semi-arid grasslands can be constrained by aridity. Plant functional groups (PFGs) are the most basic component of community structure (CS) and biodiversity & ecosystem function (BEF). They have been suggested as identity-dependent in quantifying the response to grazing intensity and drought severity. Here, we examine how the relationships among PFGs, CS, BEF, and grazing intensity are driven by climatic drought. We conducted a manipulative experiment with three grazing intensities in 2012 (nondrought year) and 2013 (drought year). We classified 62 herbaceous plants into four functional groups based on their life forms. We used the relative species abundance of PFGs to quantify the effects of grazing and drought, and to explore the mechanisms for the pathway correlations using structural equation models (SEM) among PFGs, CS, and BEF directly or indirectly. Grazers consistently favored the perennial forbs (e.g., palatable or nutritious plants), decreasing the plants' relative abundance by 23%-38%. Drought decreased the relative abundance of ephemeral plants by 42 ± 13%; and increased perennial forbs by 20 ± 7% and graminoids by 80 ± 31%. SEM confirmed that annuals and biennials had negative correlations with the other three PFGs, with perennial bunchgrasses facilitated by perennial rhizome grass. Moreover, the contributions of grazing to community structure (i.e., canopy height) were 1.6-6.1 times those from drought, whereas drought effect on community species richness was 3.6 times of the grazing treatment. Lastly, the interactive effects of grazing and drought on BEF were greater than either alone; particularly, drought escalated grazing damage on primary production. Synthesis. The responses of PFGs, CS, and BEF to grazing and drought were identity-dependent, suggesting that grazing and drought regulation of plant functional groups might be a way to shape ecosystem structure and function in grasslands.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121883276', 'afid': '121883276', 'affilname': 'School of Natural Resources and the Environment The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'Honduras'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121012475', 'afid': '121012475', 'affilname': 'School of Ecology and Environment Inner Mongolia University Hohhot China', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,,"['Liang M.', 'Chen J.', 'Gornish E.', 'Bai X.', 'Li Z.', 'Liang C.']","['56393727400', '8985856500', '35725305900', '57203130807', '56269028800', '15073826900']",Drought | Ecosystem function | Mongolian Plateau | Plant competition and facilitation | Plant functional group | Plant-climate interactions | Plant-herbivore interaction | Temperate grasslands,,undefined,,,1523628

Temperate and semiarid grasslands comprise 80% of the land area on the Mongolian Plateau and environs, which includes Mongolia (MG), and the province of Inner Mongolia (IM), China. Substantial land cover/use change in the last few decades, driven by a combination of post-liberalization socioeconomic changes and extreme climatic events, has degraded these water-limited grassland's structure and function. Hence, a precise estimation of canopy cover (CC, %) and aboveground biomass (AGB, g m−2) is needed. In this study, we analyzed >1000 field observations with sampling during June, July and August (JJA) in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2016 in IM and 2010–2012 and 2014–2016 in MG. The field sampling was stratified by the dominant vegetation types on the plateau, including the meadow steppe, the typical steppe, and the desert steppe. Here we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived surface reflectance and vegetation indices optimized for low cover conditions to develop and test predictive models of CC and AGB using observed samples as training and validation data through rule-based regression tree models. We then used the predictive models to estimate spatially-explicit CC and AGB for the plateau over the last decade (2000–2016). Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of our predictive models in up-scaling ground observations to the regional scale across steppe types. Our results showed that model R2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.74 (13.1%) and 0.62 (85.9 g m−2), respectively. The validation R2 and RMSE for CC and AGB were 0.67 (14.4%) and 0.68 (76.9 g m−2), respectively. The mean ± SD for CC and AGB were 24.9 ± 23.4% and 155.2 ± 115.2 g m−2, respectively. We also found that our scaled up estimates were significantly related to inter-annual climatic variability and anthropogenic drivers especially distance to urban/built-up areas and livestock density. In addition to their direct use in quantifying the spatiotemporal changes in the terrestrial carbon budget, results from these predictive models can help decision makers and rangeland managers plan sustainable livestock practices in the future.",22,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['John R.', 'Chen J.', 'Giannico V.', 'Park H.', 'Xiao J.', 'Shirkey G.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'Shao C.', 'Lafortezza R.', 'Qi J.']","['23970517000', '8985856500', '56997375000', '57193776863', '8530104100', '56524662100', '36898804300', '24336312100', '14421241900', '7201522137']",Cubist | Grasslands | Livestock density | MODIS | Mongolian Plateau | Semiarid,NASA,1313761,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0034425718302153,1523628

Aims: This review was developed to introduce the essential components and variants of structural equation modeling (SEM), synthesize the common issues in SEM applications, and share our views on SEM’s future in ecological research. Methods: We searched the Web of Science on SEM applications in ecological studies from 1999 through 2016 and summarized the potential of SEMs, with a special focus on unexplored uses in ecology. We also analyzed and discussed the common issues with SEM applications in previous publications and presented our view for its future applications. Results: We searched and found 146 relevant publications on SEM applications in ecological studies. We found that five SEM variants had not commenly been applied in ecology, including the latent growth curve model, Bayesian SEM, partial least square SEM, hierarchical SEM, and variable/model selection. We identified ten common issues in SEM applications including strength of causal assumption, specification of feedback loops, selection of models and variables, identification of models, methods of estimation, explanation of latent variables, selection of fit indices, report of results, estimation of sample size, and the fit of model. Conclusions: In previous ecological studies, measurements of latent variables, explanations of model parameters, and reports of key statistics were commonly overlooked, while several advanced uses of SEM had been ignored overall.

The resource-driven concept, which is an important school for investigating ecosystem production, has been applied for decades. However, the regulatory mechanisms of production by multiple resources remain unclear. We formulated a new algorithm model that integrates multiple resource uses to study ecosystem production and tested its applications on a water-availability gradient in semi-arid grassland. The result of our experiment showed that changes in water availability significantly affected the resources of light and nitrogen, and altered the relationships among multiple resource absorption rate (ϵ), multiple resource use efficiency (mRUE), and available resource (R avail). The increased water availability suppressed ecosystem mRUE (i.e., ""declining marginal returns""); The changes in mRUE had a negative effect on ϵ (i.e., ""inverse feedback""). These two processes jointly regulated that the stimulated single resource availability would promote ecosystem production rather than suppress it, even when mRUE was reduced. This study illustrated the use of the mRUE model in exploring the coherent relationships among the key parameters on regulating the ecosystem production for future modeling, and evaluated the sensitivity of this conceptual model under different dataset properties. However, this model needs extensive validation by the ecological community before it can extrapolate this method to other ecosystems in the future.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003146', 'afid': '60003146', 'affilname': 'Henan University', 'affiliation-city': 'Kaifeng', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han J.', 'Chen J.', 'Miao Y.', 'Wan S.']","['55796896300', '8985856500', '56591493900', '8968414000']",,,undefined,,,1523628

As a consequence of the global increase in economic and societal prosperity, ecosystems and natural resources have been substantially exploited, degraded, or even destroyed in the last century. To prevent further deprivation of the quality of ecosystems, the ecosystem services concept has become a central issue in environmental studies. A growing number of environmental agencies and organizations worldwide are now embracing integrated approaches to plan and manage ecosystems, sharing a goal to maintain the long-term provision of ecosystem services for sustainability. A daunting challenge in this process is to move from general pronouncements about the tremendous benefits that ecosystems provide to society to defensible assessments of their services. In other words, we must move beyond the scientific evidences of the ecosystem services concept to its practical applications. In this work, we discuss the theoretical foundations and applications of ecosystem services with a focus on the assessment of ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies at various spatial and temporal scales. Here, we offer examples of the main factors related to land use management that may affect the provision of ecosystem services and provide direction for future research on ecosystem services and related nature-based solutions.

Driven by drastic socioeconomic changes in China and Mongolia, urbanization has become one of the most significant driving forces in the transformation of the Mongolian Plateau in the past 30 years. Using Hohhot and Ulaanbaatar as case studies, we developed a holistic approach to examine the socioeconomic and natural driving forces for urbanization and to investigate the impact on the urban environment. We used a multidisciplinary approach and relied on a variety of data sources to assess the changes of the landscape and environment of the two cities. We detected a rapid urbanization in Hohhot and Ulaanbaatar, both in terms of urban population growth and urban land expansion, from 1990 to 2010, with a much faster speed in 2000-2010. The local geo-physical conditions have constrained the spatial direction of expansion. Ulaanbaatar lagged behind Hohhot for about a decade when measured by indicators of urban population and urban land. Both cities have a degraded urban environment and a growing air pollution epidemic. While Hohhot had worse air pollution than Ulaanbaatar in the early 2000s, the gap between the two cities became smaller after 2010.The research presented here highlights the following as key determinants for urbanization and environmental change: (1) the co-evolution of urbanization, economic development, and environmental change; (2) the urbanization of transitional economies driven by the change of the economic structure, i.e., the development by both manufacturing and tertiary sectors and the change in the primary sector; and (3) the recent institutional changes and increased integration with the global economy.",43,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fan P.', 'Chen J.', 'John R.']","['24465046600', '8985856500', '23970517000']",Economic development | Environment | Mongolian Plateau | Urbanization,NASA,1313761,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S001393511530089X,1523628

Background: As a consequence of global change, intensity and frequency of extreme events such as heat waves (HW) have been increasing worldwide. Methods: By using a combination of continuous 60-year meteorological and 6-year tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, we constructed a clear picture of a HWs effect on the dynamics of carbon, water, and vegetation on the Eurasian Songnen meadow steppe. Results: The number of HWs in the Songnen meadow steppe began increasing since the 1980s and the rate of occurrence has advanced since the 2010s to higher than ever before. HWs can reduce the grassland carbon flux, while net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) will regularly fluctuate for 4-5 days during the HW before decreasing. However, ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) decline from the beginning of the HW until the end, where Re and GEP will decrease 30% and 50%, respectively. When HWs last five days, water-use efficiency (WUE) will decrease by 26%, soil water content (SWC) by 30% and soil water potential (SWP) will increase by 38%. In addition, the soil temperature will still remain high after the HW although the air temperature will recover to its previous state. Conclusions: HWs, as an extreme weather event, have increased during the last two decades in the Songnen meadow steppe. HWs will reduce the carbon flux of the steppe and will cause a sustained impact. Drought may be the main reason why HWs decrease carbon flux. At the later stages of or after a HW, the ecosystem usually lacks water and the soil becomes so hot and dry that it prevents roots from absorbing enough water to maintain their metabolism. This is the main reason why this grassland carbon exchange decreases during and after HWs.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009509', 'afid': '60009509', 'affilname': 'Northeast Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Changchun', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qu L.', 'Chen J.', 'Dong G.', 'Jiang S.', 'Li L.', 'Guo J.', 'Shao C.']","['56861693900', '8985856500', '48761185400', '7404452114', '56849678000', '55644882200', '24336312100']",Carbon flux | Eddy covariance | Extreme climate | Global change | Grassland | Temperature,NASA,NNX14AD85G,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0013935115300736,1523628

Northern Eurasian ecosystems play an important role in the global climate system. Northern Eurasia (NE) has experienced dramatic climate changes during the last half of the 20th century and to present. To date, how evapotranspiration (ET) and water availability (P–ET, P: precipitation) had changed in response to the climatic change in this region has not been well evaluated. This study uses an improved version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) that explicitly considers ET from uplands, wetlands, water bodies and snow cover to examine temporal and spatial variations in ET, water availability and river discharge in NE for the period 1948–2009. The average ET over NE increased during the study period at a rate of 0.13 mm year−1 year−1. Over this time, water availability augmented in the western part of the region, but decreased in the eastern part. The consideration of snow sublimation substantially improved the ET estimates and highlighted the importance of snow in the hydrometeorology of NE. We also find that the modified TEM estimates of water availability in NE watersheds are in good agreement with corresponding measurements of historical river discharge before 1970. However, a systematic underestimation of river discharge occurs after 1970 indicates that other water sources or dynamics not considered by the model (e.g., melting glaciers, permafrost thawing and fires) may also be important for the hydrology of the region.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110457', 'afid': '60110457', 'affilname': 'Institute of Forest Science, Russian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Uspenskoe', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103885', 'afid': '60103885', 'affilname': 'Sukachev Institute of Forest of the Siberian Branch of the RAS', 'affiliation-city': 'Krasnoyarsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033316', 'afid': '60033316', 'affilname': 'Universiteit Gent', 'affiliation-city': 'Ghent', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028629', 'afid': '60028629', 'affilname': 'College of Science', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028402', 'afid': '60028402', 'affilname': 'Ecosystems Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Woods Hole', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020650', 'afid': '60020650', 'affilname': 'University of Bristol', 'affiliation-city': 'Bristol', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551', 'afid': '60013551', 'affilname': 'China Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254', 'afid': '60009254', 'affilname': 'Purdue University', 'affiliation-city': 'West Lafayette', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Liu Y.', 'Zhuang Q.', 'Pan Z.', 'Miralles D.', 'Tchebakova N.', 'Kicklighter D.', 'Chen J.', 'Sirin A.', 'He Y.', 'Zhou G.', 'Melillo J.']","['55742038700', '8072265400', '8251952200', '36061813500', '16445196200', '6603810350', '8985856500', '7003277875', '55797749000', '7403686091', '7004628271']",,NSF,0919331,National Science Foundation,,1523628

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to test hypotheses about the effects of economic and weather factors on the inventories of cattle, sheep and goats in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR). Design/methodology/approach: An equilibrium displacement model of livestock products is combined with an inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) to deduce hypothesis about the effects of expected price and feed costs, weather, and supply and demand shifters on herd size. Dynamics are incorporated using the partial adjustment and adaptive expectations models originally proposed by Nerlove (1956). The hypotheses are tested using both the structural equations implied by the model, and the reduced form. Findings: Results suggest livestock inventories in IMAR in general are more responsive to weather conditions than to economic conditions. This is especially true for cattle and sheep, where isolated 1 percent changes in weather variables, namely precipitation and radiation, were found to have a much larger effect on inventory than isolated 1 percent changes in expected price and forage costs. The effects of the weather variables, moreover, were found to be different for goats than for cattle and sheep, with goat numbers decreasing with improvements in weather, and cattle and sheep numbers increasing. This suggests herders respond to poor weather in part by substituting goats for cattle and/or sheep. Price was found to have a negative effect on cattle inventory, and no effect on sheep and goat inventory. Forage costs were found to have a positive effect on cattle and sheep inventories, and no effect on goat inventory. These results suggest policies to protect grassland by controlling inventory levels must be designed carefully if they are to be effective. Originality/value: The paper makes a methodological contribution in that the livestock inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) is extended to include supply and demand shifters for livestock products in a partial-equilibrium setting where the industry in question is a net exporter of livestock products. The paper makes an empirical contribution in that additional evidence is provided on the role that price plays in inventory behavior.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024045', 'afid': '60024045', 'affilname': 'Nanjing Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ge W.', 'Kinnucan H.']","['57195488385', '6701811824']",Dynamics | Equilibrium displacement model | Inventories | Livestock,,undefined,,,1523628

Background: Companioned by economic development, a dietary shift toward higher meat consumption is seen in developing countries and transitional economies, where the demand for livestock production has been increasing in response to such a dietary shift. In the Asian Dryland Belt, approaches to meet this demand have focused on grazing intensification, cropland conversion for animal feed, and supplemental feeding. With the scarcity of water, energy, and food in the region, a key question is whether or not the current approaches are sustainable. If not, what are the pathways to increase livestock production while protecting the region’s environment for a sustainable future? We provide our reviews and discuss current approaches in response to these dietary shifts and assess their environmental resilience with a focus on the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Results: While current approaches alleviate the urgent need for short-term livestock production, they lead to long-term vulnerability in food security. Trade-offs between short gains and long-term losses, between food for humans and for animals, and between agricultural intensification and environmental degradation need to be holistically examined for the sustainable development of the region. A grassland water, energy, and food nexus framework is proposed with specific recommendations to increase livestock production while considering other ecosystem services of the dryland grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Conclusions: Current practices to increase livestock production are likely to lead to long-term, large-scale ecological degradation of the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt and are thus unsustainable. By considering the trade-offs in the nexus of water, land, food, and livelihoods, sustainable pathways were articulated and recommended.

Quantifying the surface energy fluxes of grazed and ungrazed steppes is essential to understand the roles of grasslands in local and global climate and in land use change. We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010-2012). Near 95% of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5% at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared ~50% of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn - G) and H indicated a ""cooling effect"" feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shao C.', 'Chen J.', 'Li L.', 'Dong G.', 'Han J.', 'Abraha M.', 'John R.']","['24336312100', '8985856500', '56849678000', '48761185400', '55796896300', '13008527200', '23970517000']",available energy | cooling effect | ecosystem function | ecosystem stability | eddy-covariance | energy balance | energy partitioning | land use change | latent heat | net radiation | sensible heat | soil heat,,undefined,,,1523628

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. The dryland belt (DLB) in Northern Eurasia is the largest contiguous dryland on Earth. During the last century, changes here have included land use change (e.g. expansion of croplands and cities), resource extraction (e.g. coal, ores, oil, and gas), rapid institutional shifts (e.g. collapse of the Soviet Union), climatic changes, and natural disturbances (e.g. wildfires, floods, and dust storms). These factors intertwine, overlap, and sometimes mitigate, but can sometimes feedback upon each other to exacerbate their synergistic and cumulative effects. Thus, it is important to properly document each of these external and internal factors and to characterize the structural relationships among them in order to develop better approaches to alleviating negative consequences of these regional environmental changes.

Nighttime light data (NTL) is one of the major remote sensing data sources for regional/global built-up or impervious surface mapping. A single regression relationship between fractional built-up/impervious area and NTL or various indices derived based on NTL and vegetation index (e.g., NDVI) data had been established in many previous studies. However, due to the varying geographical, climatic, and socio-economic characteristics of cities, the same regression relationship may vary significantly across cities. In this study, we examined the regression relationship between percentage of built-up area (pBUA) and vegetation adjusted nighttime light urban index (VANUI) for 120 randomly selected cities around the world with a hierarchical hockey-stick regression model. We found that there is a substantial variability in the slope (0.658 ± 0.318), the threshold VANUI (−1.92 ± 0.769, log scale) after which the linear relationship holds, and the coefficient of determination R 2 (0.71 ± 0.14) among globally distributed cities. A small proportion of this substantial variability can be attributed to socio-economic status (e.g., total population, GDP per capita) and landscape structures (e.g., compactness and fragmentation). Due to these variations, our hierarchical model or no-pooling model (i.e., fit each city individually) can significantly improve model prediction accuracy (17% in terms of root mean squared error) over a complete-pooling model. We, however, recommend hierarchical models as they can provide meaningful priors for future modeling under a Bayesian framework, and achieve higher prediction accuracy than no-pooling models when sample size is small.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021624', 'afid': '60021624', 'affilname': 'The University of Toledo', 'affiliation-city': 'Toledo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020059', 'afid': '60020059', 'affilname': 'Georgia Southern University', 'affiliation-city': 'Statesboro', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ouyang Z.', 'Lin M.', 'Chen J.', 'Fan P.', 'Qian S.', 'Park H.']","['36898804300', '57203279940', '8985856500', '24465046600', '7202425716', '57193776863']",Bayesian | DMSP-OLS | Hierarchical model | Human settlement | MODIS | Urban land,NASA,1313761,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S004896971832984X,1523628

All rights reserved. An ecosystem is a system formed by the interaction of a community of organisms with their environment within a geographic unit or region, and ecosystem sustainability is an ecosystem’s capacity to endure and maintain its functions and services indefinitely. Although some literature is emerging on the development of sustainability science frameworks, there is little information available on framing ecosystem sustainability. Part of the challenge is that it requires the full integration of natural and human systems with a quantitative nexus among all fundamental elements of an ecosystem. In this chapter, we first review the key elements of ecosystem sustainability, and then provide a review of remote sensing capabilities to provide spatio-temporal dynamics of key indicators of an ecosystem that are critical to its sustainability. While traditional sustainability science tends to focus on four pillars of sustainability-social, environmental, economic, and cultural-ecosystem sustainability will need to be placed in a global context. This chapter focuses on the environmental dimension of sustainability science with a review of remote sensing capabilities for such applications.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003970', 'afid': '60003970', 'affilname': 'Zhejiang University', 'affiliation-city': 'Hangzhou', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Book,Chapter,"['Qi J.', 'Chen J.', 'Lafortezza R.', 'Lin Z.']","['7201522137', '57215838320', '14421241900', '57194450407']",Coupled nature and human systems | Ecosystems | Geospatial information | Landscape ecology | Remote sensing | Sustainability | Sustainability indicators,,undefined,,,1523628

Grazing profoundly influences vegetation and the subsequent carbon fluxes in various ecosystems. However, little effort has been made to explore the underlying mechanisms for phenological changes and their consequences on carbon fluxes at ecosystem level, especially under the coupled influences of human disturbances and climate change. Here, a manipulative experiment (2012-2013) was conducted to examine both the independent and interactive effects of grazing and watering on carbon fluxes across phenological phases in a desert steppe. Grazing advanced or delayed phenological timing, leading to a shortened green-up phase (GrP: 23.60 days) in 2013 and browning phase (BrP: 12.48 days) in 2012 from high grazing, and insignificant effects on the reproductive phase (ReP) in either year. High grazing significantly enhance carbon uptake, while light grazing reduce carbon uptake in ReP. Watering only delayed the browning time by 5.01 days in 2013, producing no significant effects on any phenophase. Watering promoted the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) only in the GrP. When calculating the yearly differences in phenophases and the corresponding carbon fluxes, we found that an extended GrP greatly enhanced NEE, but a prolonged ReP distinctly reduced it. The extended GrP also significantly promote GEP. Increases in growing season length appeared promoting ER, regardless of any phenophase. Additionally, the shifts in NEE appeared dependent of the variations in leaf area index (LAI).",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121458', 'afid': '60121458', 'affilname': 'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014773', 'afid': '60014773', 'affilname': 'Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003146', 'afid': '60003146', 'affilname': 'Henan University', 'affiliation-city': 'Kaifeng', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han J.', 'Li L.', 'Chu H.', 'Miao Y.', 'Chen S.', 'Chen J.']","['55796896300', '56849678000', '55220380900', '56591493900', '26031336300', '8985856500']",Carbon | Desert steppe | Grazing | Human disturbances | Phenology | Water,NSF,1313761,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0013935115300748,1523628

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. Spanning a vast territory of approximately 13 million km2, Asian Russia was home to 38 million people in 2016. In an effort to synthesize data and knowledge regarding urbanization and sustainable development in Asian Russia in the context of socioeconomic transformation following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990, we quantified the spatiotemporal changes of urban dynamics using satellite imagery and explored the interrelationships between urbanization and sustainability. We then developed a sustainability index, complemented with structural equation modeling, for a comprehensive analysis of their dynamics. We chose six case cities, i.e., Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Omsk, Irkutsk, and Khabarovsk, as representatives of large cities to investigate whether large cities are in sync with the region in terms of population dynamics, urbanization, and sustainability. Our major findings include the following. First, Asian Russia experienced enhanced economic growth despite the declining population. Furthermore, our case cities showed a general positive trend for population dynamics and urbanization as all except Irkutsk experienced population increases and all expanded their urban built-up areas, ranging from 13% to 16% from 1990 to 2014. Second, Asian Russia and its three federal districts have improved their sustainability and levels of economic development, environmental conditions, and social development. Although both regional sustainability and economic development experienced a serious dip in the 1990s, environmental conditions and social development continuously improved from 1990 to 2014, with social development particularly improving after 1995. Third, in terms of the relationships between urbanization and sustainability, economic development appeared as an important driver of urbanization, social development, and environmental degradation in Asian Russia, with economic development having a stronger influence on urbanization than on social development or environmental degradation.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030840', 'afid': '60030840', 'affilname': 'Københavns Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Copenhagen', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016296', 'afid': '60016296', 'affilname': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121522725', 'afid': '121522725', 'affilname': ""Russian Federal Nature Preserve (Zapovednik) 'Denezhkin Kamen'"", 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121522691', 'afid': '121522691', 'affilname': 'Institute of Environmental Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Kazan', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fan P.', 'Chen J.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'Groisman P.', 'Loboda T.', 'Gutman G.', 'Prishchepov A.V.', 'Kvashnina A.', 'Messina J.', 'Moore N.', 'Myint S.W.', 'Qi J.']","['24465046600', '8985856500', '36898804300', '7004442182', '57203048222', '7102122338', '36946308900', '56733078900', '7005126983', '15319727100', '7006694494', '7201522137']",Asian Russia | economic development | environmental condition | social development | sustainability | urbanization,NASA,1717770,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,1523628

Until 5,000 YBP there is no evidence of lasting human influences on ecosystems, but after this time, changes in vegetation and soil physical properties signal domestic livestock grazing impacts on steppe ecosystems. Contemporary (1991–2015) literature and region by region analysis of climate, livestock, remote-sensing and human population data reveal two potential tipping points. Temperatures warmed across the 5 regions. Since 1991, livestock densities and forage use increased in most regions, the spatial distribution of grazing pressure is more heterogeneous, and variability increased in stocking densities, forage use and forage production in all or most regions. Substantial plant species shifts and losses occurred in the mountain and forest steppe regions. Although a large proportion of Mongolia's rangelands are altered from their ecological potential, few have crossed an irreversible threshold of ecological change. Rangelands in Mongolia's Khangai, northern and central regions may be approaching an ecological tipping point if grazing pressure is not reduced. After 1991, herder populations initially rose and then decreased significantly across most regions. If demographic and social trends contribute to loss of herding knowledge and identity, a cultural tipping point could occur. We describe four potential future scenarios that could unfold if these tipping points are reached, hypothesize feedbacks between ecological and cultural thresholds, and discuss implications for policy and management.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025837', 'afid': '60025837', 'affilname': 'Blackland Research and Extension Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Temple', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Fernández-Giménez M.', 'Venable N.', 'Angerer J.', 'Fassnacht S.', 'Reid R.', 'Khishigbayar J.']","['6603129643', '55207053400', '8282209900', '6603909200', '7401758111', '56156979400']",Archaeology | Coupled human and natural system | Paleo-ecology | Pastoralism | Social-ecological system | Threshold,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2213305417300061,1523628

Context: The Mongolian Plateau, comprising Inner Mongolia, China (IM) and Mongolia (MG) is undergoing consistent warming and accelerated land cover/land use change. Extensive modifications of water-limited regions can alter ecosystem function and processes; hence, it is important to differentiate the impacts of human activities and precipitation dynamics on vegetation productivity. Objectives: This study distinguished between human-induced and precipitation-driven changes in vegetation cover on the plateau across biome, vegetation type and administrative divisions. Methods: Non-parametric trend tests were applied to the time series of vegetation indices (VI) derived from MODIS and AVHRR and precipitation from TRMM and MERRA reanalysis data. VI residuals adjusted for rainfall were obtained from the regression between growing season maximum VI and monthly accumulated rainfall (June–August) and were used to detect human-induced trends in vegetation productivity during 1981–2010. The total livestock and population density trends were identified and then used to explain the VI residual trends. Results: The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were negatively correlated to total livestock density (R2 = 0.59 and 0.16, p < 0.05) in MG and positively correlated with total population density (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.05) in IM. The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were also negatively correlated with goat density (R2 = 0.59 and 0.19, p < 0.05) and sheep density in MG (R2 = 0.59 and 0.13, p < 0.05) but not in IM. Conclusions: Some administrative subdivisions in IM and MG showed decreasing trends in VI residuals. These trends could be attributed to increasing livestock or population density and changes in livestock herd composition. Other subdivisions showed increasing trends residuals, suggesting that the vegetation cover increase could be attributed to conservation efforts.",48,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119216', 'afid': '60119216', 'affilname': 'University of the Humanities', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072642', 'afid': '60072642', 'affilname': 'Mongolian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022355', 'afid': '60022355', 'affilname': 'University of Montana', 'affiliation-city': 'Missoula', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['John R.', 'Chen J.', 'Kim Y.', 'Ou-yang Z.t.', 'Xiao J.', 'Park H.', 'Shao C.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Amarjargal A.', 'Batkhshig O.', 'Qi J.']","['23970517000', '8985856500', '55699587100', '55880999200', '8530104100', '56799345700', '24336312100', '8693543800', '56668753300', '56801105900', '7201522137']",EVI | EVI2 | GIMMS3 g NDVI | Livestock density | MODIS | Mongolian Plateau | Population density | Precipitation | RESTREND | Semi-arid | Vegetation indices,NSF,1313761,National Science Foundation,,1523628

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Variations in ecosystem composition and structure within a cover type of the same biome can be responsible for the large amounts of uncertainty in remote sensing modeling of aboveground biomass (AGB). Based on 820 ground measurements of AGB and the pure vegetation index models, we proposed a spatially variable remote sensing scalar (i.e., M scalar) in estimating AGB by addressing within-type variations of vegetation. We tested this new modeling approach in Inner Mongolia grasslands and achieved a higher R2 (>0.88) and lower RMSE value (<28.17 g/m2) than those in the conventional remote sensing models. The annual average (STD) of the grassland AGB for 2001–2016 was ~87 (±9) Tg, with an AGB density of 104 ± 74 g/m2. The interannual variation of AGB appeared insignificant over the study period, except in the western region where it increased significantly. The dynamics of AGB were highly correlated with drought severity during the growing season (R2 = 0.691, P < 0.001). AGB under normal climate (i.e., without drought) was ~90.88 Tg, but it increased by ~19% (17.11 Tg) in a wet year (2012) and decreased by 20% (18.16 Tg) in a dry year (2001). More importantly, the high grazing intensity played a less significant role in directing grassland AGB dynamics (R2 = 0.024, P = 0.599). Future efforts are needed to explore how within-type variation of vegetation may change temporally and spatially in accurate estimate of AGB across heterogeneous landscapes, as well as the potential underlying mechanisms from biological, physical, and human perspectives.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027277', 'afid': '60027277', 'affilname': 'Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000264', 'afid': '60000264', 'affilname': 'Nagoya University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nagoya', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li F.', 'Chen J.', 'Zeng Y.', 'Wu B.', 'Zhang X.']","['57214075462', '8985856500', '56949561600', '8318166100', '36562756000']",aboveground biomass | drought | Inner Mongolia grasslands | livestock | PDSI | remote sensing model,NSF,NIGLAS2016TD01,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,,1523628

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. The Mongolian Plateau hosts two different governments: the Mongolian People's Republic and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a provincial-level government of the People's Republic of China. The divergence between these governments has widened in the past century, mostly due to a series of institutional changes that generated different socioeconomic and demographic trajectories. Due to its high latitude and altitude, the Plateau has been highly sensitive to the rapid changes in global and regional climates that have altered the spatial and temporal distributions of energy and water. Based on a recent workshop to synthesize findings on the sustainability of the Plateau amidst socioeconomic and environmental change, we identify five critical issues facing the social-ecological systems (SES): (1) divergent and uncertain changes in social and ecological characteristics; (2) declining prevalence of nomadism; (3) consequences of rapid urbanization in transitional economies; (4) the unsustainability of large-scale afforestation efforts in the semi-arid and arid areas of Inner Mongolia; and (5) the role of institutional changes in shaping the SES on the Plateau.

The Mongolian Plateau (MP) and Tibetan Plateau (TP) have experienced higher-than-global average warming in recent decades, resulting in many significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. Among them are the leaf area index (LAI) and albedo, which play a fundamental role in understanding many causes and consequences of land surface processes and climate. Here, we focused on the spatiotemporal changes of LAI, albedo, and their spatiotemporal relationships on the two roofing landscapes in Eurasia. Based on the MODIS products, we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of albedo(VIS, NIR and SHO) and LAI from 2000 through 2016. We found that there existed a general negative logarithmic relationship between LAI and three measures of albedo on both plateaus. No significant relationship was found for LAI-albedoNIR on the TP, due to more complex land surface canopy characteristics affected by the NIR reflection there. During 2000-2016, overall, annual mean LAI increased significantly by 119.40 × 103 km2 on the MP and by 28.35 × 103 km2 on the TP, while the decreased areas for annual mean albedoVIS were 585.59 × 103 km2 and 235.73 × 103 km2 on the MP and TP, respectively. More importantly, the LAI-albedo relationships varied substantially across the space and over time, with mismatches found in some parts of the landscapes. Substantial additional efforts with observational and/or experimental investigations are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for these relationships, including the influences of vegetation characteristics and disturbances.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031150', 'afid': '60031150', 'affilname': 'Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Tian L.', 'Chen J.', 'Shao C.']","['56221884800', '8985856500', '24336312100']",Albedo | Alpine | Altitude and latitude | Energy balance | Eurasian continent | Global warming | Land surface process | Leaf area index (LAI),NSFC,41601100,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,1523628

Published by IOP Publishing Ltd Temperate grasslands, including those of northern Eurasia, are among the most imperiled ecosystems on Earth. Eighty percent of Mongolia's land area is rangeland, where interacting climate, land-use and changes in governance threaten the sustainability of Mongolia's rangelands and pastoral culture. Particularly concerning are the potential ecological impacts of changing pastoral grazing practices-namely declining use of grazing reserves and pastoral mobility. However, like other grazing practices globally, there have been no empirical studies to evaluate the effects of specific Mongolian grazing practices on ecological function at a management scale. We collected data on the grazing practices of 130 pastoral households across four ecological zones and sampled ecological conditions in their winter pastures. We used a novel social-ecological analysis process to (1) develop integrated, holistic indicators of ecological function using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and (2) assess the effects of individual grazing practices on these indicators using statistical matching to control for confounding management and contextual factors. We identified two latent factors related to ecological and pastoral resilience: Factor 1 represents resource retention and soil stability and Factor 2 represents species richness and functional diversity. Using these two factors as response variables, we found that the values of both resilience factors were higher in pastures where households made fall or winter otor migrations or set aside grazing reserves. This study provides the first management-scale empirical test of the ecological response to specific grazing practices in Mongolia, using an approach that can be applied in other rangeland systems. Our findings highlight the importance to ecological and pastoral resilience of supporting traditional pastoral practices of mobility and grazing reserves, while also controlling stocking densities, increasing rangeland monitoring, and ensuring equitable access to state-designated emergency grazing reserves at local, regional, and national levels.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60151531', 'afid': '60151531', 'affilname': 'National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)', 'affiliation-city': 'Annapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072642', 'afid': '60072642', 'affilname': 'Mongolian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025837', 'afid': '60025837', 'affilname': 'Blackland Research and Extension Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Temple', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003088', 'afid': '60003088', 'affilname': 'The George Washington University', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121639743', 'afid': '121639743', 'affilname': 'Saruul Khuduu Environmental Research and Consulting', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115440840', 'afid': '115440840', 'affilname': 'Nutag Action Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101523932', 'afid': '101523932', 'affilname': 'Center for Nomadic Pastoralism Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Fernández-Giménez M.E.', 'Allington G.R.H.', 'Angerer J.', 'Reid R.S.', 'Jamsranjav C.', 'Ulambayar T.', 'Hondula K.', 'Baival B.', 'Batjav B.', 'Altanzul T.', 'Baasandorj Y.']","['6603129643', '35316885800', '8282209900', '7401758111', '57090734600', '55999091900', '55372706700', '55623833600', '6505797191', '55971263500', '56487896900']",Dzud | Grassland | Mobility | Otor | Pastoralism | Resilience | Statistical matching,SESYNC,BCS-1011801,National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center,,1523628

Yet field data based on sound experiment on the variation of ecosystem CO2 levels under HWs remain rare. Additionally, ecosystems react to HWs and the coupled human activities (such as grazing in grasslands) are unknown. Thus, a 3-year field experiment was conducted to simulate HWs in conjunction with different mowing intensities that mimicking grazing in a Stipa krylovii steppe on the Mongolian Plateau. HWs significantly decreased ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) by 31%, 5% and 16%, respectively, over the three years. Continuous HWs over multiple years produced cumulative effects by reducing NEE at 20%, 34% and 40% in the first, second and third HW years, respectively. During three pre-defined three periods of HWs (during HW period, after HW period in the same year, and after HW period in the next year), variations in water use efficiency indicated that the grassland ecosystem exhibited a strategy for adapting to the continuous HWs to a certain extent, by adjusting community structure or increasing litter biomass. Finally, mowing increased the effects of HWs by extending the legacy effect, such that restoration of the grassland required a greater amount of time under the combination of HWs and mowing.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004630', 'afid': '60004630', 'affilname': 'Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fuzhou', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qu L.', 'Chen J.', 'Dong G.', 'Shao C.']","['56861693900', '8985856500', '48761185400', '24336312100']",Carbon assimilation | Clipping | Ecosystem function | Extreme weather event | Global warming | Water use efficiency,NSF,720-16,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969718303425,1523628

In the context of socioeconomic and biophysical changes, our knowledge on these urbanization processes remains limited. Here, we used the Mongolian Plateau (i.e., Inner Mongolia (IM) and Mongolia (MG)) as a testbed and applied the coupled natural and human (CNH) concept to understand the processes and causes of urbanization. We selected six cities on the Mongolian Plateau, classified their urban built-up areas using Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) from 1990 through 2015, and examined the driving forces of urbanization (i.e., economy, social goods, and environmental variables) through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). We found that the spatial characteristics of urbanization in IM and MG have both similarities and differences. The cities in IM and MG have experienced rapid urban expansion, with urban areas increasing by 4.36 times and 3.12 times, respectively, since 1990. Cities in IM, however, were less dense and more sprawling whereas cities in MG were linearly aggregated. We also found through PLS-SEM that multiple driving forces affected urbanization in IM and MG during the transitional period. Results (path coef.) demonstrated that economic development (0.559) is a major driver for urbanization in IM, whereas social goods (0.646) and economic development (0.433) strongly influence urbanization in MG.

One major concern is how the covariations of climate warming and extremes (e.g., ENSO) affect agricultural systems and production. Here, a dual-cropping system in the Huaihe Plain was used as a testbed to address this issue. We found that climate warming during 1982–2013 ha s produced remarkable influences on the dual-cropping agricultural system. For the spring season crop (i.e., winter wheat), a significant negative effect was found with a production loss of ˜6.9 × 10 6 tons due to an elevated T mean (˜2.21 °C) (r=-0.508, p < 0.01), which was associated with water stress. For the summer/autumn crops (i.e., rice and maize), a significant positive effect was found, but with a less substantial production gain (˜1.4 × 10 6 tons), supposedly due to the relaxed temperature constraints (an increased T max of ˜1.28 °C) for high heat resistant crops (r = 0.495, p < 0.01). The phenophase of the crop growing period was shortened by ˜7 days for the spring crop and by ˜4.4 days for the summer/autumn crops with enhanced thermal conditions. Precipitation anomalies, especially those associated with ENSO turning from El Niño to La Niña, imposed an additional serious impact on the dual-cropping system through decreased precipitation in the spring and increased precipitation in the summer/autumn. Potential impacts for the future could be derived from intensification of water and heat stresses, as well as the climate extremes (e.g., ENSO and AAO).",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100380163', 'afid': '100380163', 'affilname': 'China Land Surveying and Planning Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li F.', 'Chen J.', 'Zheng J.']","['57214075462', '8985856500', '57205721204']",Climate warming | Crop production | Dual-cropping system | ENSO | Huaihe Plain | Phenology | Precipitation anomaly,NSF,NIGLAS2016TD01,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168192319300632,1523628

Background Quantifying carbon (C) dioxide exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere and the underlying mechanism of biophysical regulations under similar environmental conditions is critical for an accurate understanding of C budgets and ecosystem functions. Methods For the first time, a cluster of four eddy covariance towers were set up to answer how C fluxes shift among four dominant ecosystems in Mongolia – meadow steppe (MDW), typical steppe (TPL), dry typical steppe (DRT) and shrubland (SHB) during two growing seasons (2014 and 2015). Results Large variations were observed for the annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from 59 to 193 g C m− 2, though all four sites acted as a C source. During the two growing seasons, MDW acted as a C sink, TPL and DRT were C neutral, while SHB acted as a C source. MDW to SHB and TPL conversions resulted in a 2.6- and 2.2-fold increase in C release, respectively, whereas the TPL to SHB conversion resulted in a 1.1-fold increase at the annual scale. C assimilation was higher at MDW than those at the other three ecosystems due to its greater C assimilation ability and longer C assimilation times during the day and growing period. On the other hand, C release was highest at SHB due to significantly lower photosynthetic production and relatively higher ecosystem respiration (ER). A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the seasonal variations in NEE, ER and gross ecosystem production (GEP) were controlled by air temperature at MDW, while they were controlled mainly by soil moisture at TPL, DRT and SHB. When air temperature increased, the NEE at MDW and TPL changed more dramatically than at DRT and SHB, suggesting not only a stronger C release ability but also a higher temperature sensitivity at MDW and TPL. Conclusions The ongoing and predicted global changes in Mongolia likely impact the C exchange at MDW and TPL more than at DRT and SHB in Mongolia. Our results suggest that, with increasing drought and vegetation type succession, a clear trend for greater CO2 emissions may result in further global warming in the future. This study implies that diverse grassland ecosystems will respond differently to climate change in the future and can be seen as nature-based solutions (NBS) supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121458', 'afid': '60121458', 'affilname': 'Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072642', 'afid': '60072642', 'affilname': 'Mongolian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulaanbaatar', 'affiliation-country': 'Mongolia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778', 'afid': '60022778', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Bari', 'affiliation-city': 'Bari', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017705', 'afid': '60017705', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002222', 'afid': '60002222', 'affilname': 'Shanxi University', 'affiliation-city': 'Taiyuan', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shao C.', 'Chen J.', 'Chu H.', 'Lafortezza R.', 'Dong G.', 'Abraha M.', 'Batkhishig O.', 'John R.', 'Ouyang Z.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Qi J.']","['24336312100', '8985856500', '55220380900', '14421241900', '48761185400', '13008527200', '25957914700', '23970517000', '36898804300', '8693543800', '7201522137']",Carbon emission | Ecosystem function | Eddy-covariance | Global change | Global warming,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0013935117315128,1523628

Phenology is well recognized as one of the most sensitive indicators of environmental change. Previous studies have focused on flowering phenology with few efforts given to the phenological successes and vegetative processes. Additionally, grazing is often characterized as a driver for community evolutionary processes, while precipitation is known as the most important abiotic cue in arid regions. Given this knowledge, we installed a nested experiment in a desert steppe to explore the coupled effects of grazing and watering on plant species’ reproductive successes and phenological timing in 2012–2013. We found that grazing increased the proportion of non-flowering individuals, with a greater proportion in 2013 than that in 2012. It decreased species richness and changed the habitat preferences in both years, and watering also reduced the richness in both years. Grazing also delayed the phenological timing for some dominant species and significantly delayed the green-up timing (5.67 days) and shortened the growing season length (GSL) in both 2012 (7.74 days) and 2013 (4.71 days). The application of watering, however, delayed some dominant species’ timing—including the browning timing of five dominate species ranging from 9.57 days in 2013 to 1.93 days in 2012—but it did not delay the species’ green-up timing. This resulted in a significantly prolonged growing season in 2013 (8.58 days). The high soil water and optimal soil temperature in the spring of 2013 contributed to an earlier green-up time (6.1 days) than in 2012.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030931', 'afid': '60030931', 'affilname': 'University of Oklahoma', 'affiliation-city': 'Norman', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han J.', 'Chen J.', 'Xia J.', 'Li L.']","['55796896300', '8985856500', '23037516700', '56849678000']",Arid environment | Foliar damage | Phenotypic plasticity | Reproductive phenology,,undefined,,,1523628

In recent years, Central Asian grasslands have been subject to both intensive grazing and variability in climatic conditions. However, uncertainties about grazing on water cycling under climate change still exist. Therefore, the Biome-BGC grazing model was applied to assess the effects of grazing on evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE). Three grassland types were studied during the period 1979–2011: forest meadow (FM), temperate grassland (TG) and desert grassland (DG). ET shows a gradual decreasing trend from FM (365.65 ± 36.86 mm m−2 yr−1) to DG (183.32 ± 21.15 mm m−2 yr−1), and WUE ranging from 0.62 ± 0.03 g C kg-1 H2O in FM to 1.12 ± 0.10 g C kg−1 H2O in TG, with an average of 0.83 ± 0.05 g C kg−1 H2O. Although there was a significant decrease in ET of 1.47–2.72 mm m−2 yr−1, WUE increased at a rate of 0.004 g C kg−1 H2O yr−1 in Central Asia. From 1979 to 2011, grazing lowered ET by 7.47% in Central Asia; the reduction rates for FM, TG and DG were 3.10%, 12.70% and 7.42%, respectively. In general, grazing decreased WUE by 3.60%. From non-grazed to grazed scenario, WUE increased by 6.86% for FM, but WUE decreased by 7.27% and 5.61% for TG and DG. An over-compensation of GPP under grazing might account for the higher WUE under certain grazing intensities. In order to achieve maximum utilization of water efficiency, proper grazing intensity for TG, DG and FM should be limited to 0.17, 0.39 and 0.38 head/ha, respectively.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143', 'afid': '60064143', 'affilname': 'Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011754', 'afid': '60011754', 'affilname': 'Auburn University', 'affiliation-city': 'Auburn', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Han Q.', 'Li C.', 'Zhao C.', 'Zhang Y.', 'Li S.']","['37032867300', '54418872100', '7403564655', '8693543800', '14031886500']",Central Asia | Evapotranspiration | Grazing | Water use efficiency,CAS,41671030,Chinese Academy of Sciences,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S030438001830317X,1523628

Across the Earth’s surface, climate change has been occurring at a non-uniform rate, affecting biomes and directly or indirectly imposing impacts on societies. The productivity of the grassland biome has also been inevitably influenced, which in turn might affect the livestock production. Here, a meaningful indicator – growth rate index (GRI) – is proposed based on plant phenology and quantified from long-term remote sensing data to understand responses of the grassland biome to climate change at a global scale. We found a steady increase in GRI for the global grassland biome from 1982 through 2013, with around 35% of global grasslands exhibiting a significant increase (p < 0.1), and 3.8% of global grasslands experiencing a decrease. Climate warming over the past three decades did not aggravate water stress on worldwide grassland biomes, especially for the typical steppes in the Northern Hemisphere where GRI appeared more sensitive to the variations in precipitation compared to the savanna biome in the Southern Hemisphere. This study suggests that the increases in grassland GRI may have the potential to elevate global livestock production.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027277', 'afid': '60027277', 'affilname': 'Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000264', 'afid': '60000264', 'affilname': 'Nagoya University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nagoya', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114308303', 'afid': '114308303', 'affilname': 'Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Environmental Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanjing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li F.', 'Zhang X.', 'Chen J.', 'Feng B.']","['57214075462', '36562756000', '8985856500', '57203913216']",,NSF,NIGLAS2016TD01,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,,1523628

Resulting forest die-off events have severe consequences for ecosystem services, biophysical and biogeochemical land–atmosphere processes. Despite advances in monitoring, modelling and experimental studies of the causes and consequences of tree death from individual tree to ecosystem and global scale, a general mechanistic understanding and realistic predictions of drought mortality under future climate conditions are still lacking. We update a global tree mortality map and present a roadmap to a more holistic understanding of forest mortality across scales. We highlight priority research frontiers that promote: (1) new avenues for research on key tree ecophysiological responses to drought; (2) scaling from the tree/plot level to the ecosystem and region; (3) improvements of mortality risk predictions based on both empirical and mechanistic insights; and (4) a global monitoring network of forest mortality. In light of recent and anticipated large forest die-off events such a research agenda is timely and needed to achieve scientific understanding for realistic predictions of drought-induced tree mortality.

We test a trait- and process-based model to predict environmental responses from an optimization of carbon gain vs hydraulic risk. We applied four drought treatments to aspen (Populus tremuloides) saplings in a research garden. First we tested the optimization algorithm by using predawn xylem pressure as an input. We then tested the full model which calculates root-zone water budget and xylem pressure hourly throughout the growing season. The optimization algorithm performed well when run from measured predawn pressures. The per cent mean absolute error (MAE) averaged 27.7% for midday xylem pressure, transpiration, net assimilation, leaf temperature, sapflow, diffusive conductance and soil-canopy hydraulic conductance. Average MAE was 31.2% for the same observations when the full model was run from irrigation and rain data. Saplings that died were projected to exceed 85% loss in soil-canopy hydraulic conductance, whereas surviving plants never reached this threshold.

Ecology Letters published by CNRS and John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Stomatal response to environmental conditions forms the backbone of all ecosystem and carbon cycle models, but is largely based on empirical relationships. Evolutionary theories of stomatal behaviour are critical for guarding against prediction errors of empirical models under future climates. Longstanding theory holds that stomata maximise fitness by acting to maintain constant marginal water use efficiency over a given time horizon, but a recent evolutionary theory proposes that stomata instead maximise carbon gain minus carbon costs/risk of hydraulic damage. Using data from 34 species that span global forest biomes, we find that the recent carbon-maximisation optimisation theory is widely supported, revealing that the evolution of stomatal regulation has not been primarily driven by attainment of constant marginal water use efficiency. Optimal control of stomata to manage hydraulic risk is likely to have significant consequences for ecosystem fluxes during drought, which is critical given projected intensification of the global hydrological cycle.",29,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104534', 'afid': '60104534', 'affilname': 'Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Kornik', 'affiliation-country': 'Poland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032717', 'afid': '60032717', 'affilname': 'Universitat de Lleida', 'affiliation-city': 'Lleida', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030522', 'afid': '60030522', 'affilname': 'Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028442', 'afid': '60028442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Politécnica de Madrid', 'affiliation-city': 'Madrid', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026722', 'afid': '60026722', 'affilname': 'Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025488', 'afid': '60025488', 'affilname': 'The University of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023517', 'afid': '60023517', 'affilname': 'Northern Arizona University', 'affiliation-city': 'Flagstaff', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017803', 'afid': '60017803', 'affilname': 'Western Sydney University', 'affiliation-city': 'Penrith', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013805', 'afid': '60013805', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Forestry', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010586', 'afid': '60010586', 'affilname': 'Universität Ulm', 'affiliation-city': 'Ulm', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007901', 'afid': '60007901', 'affilname': 'USDA ARS Corvallis Forestry Sciences Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117496429', 'afid': '117496429', 'affilname': 'Arable Labs', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Anderegg W.', 'Wolf A.', 'Arango-Velez A.', 'Choat B.', 'Chmura D.', 'Jansen S.', 'Kolb T.', 'Li S.', 'Meinzer F.', 'Pita P.', 'Resco de Dios V.', 'Sperry J.', 'Wolfe B.', 'Pacala S.']","['36169204100', '14020924000', '41760974800', '6507795483', '14028015000', '7102376433', '7007110436', '56465402000', '57207553753', '6508254324', '24281936600', '7006352443', '15729968000', '7005624522']",climate change | drought | extreme events | plant hydraulics | vegetation model,CSC,RYC-2012-10970,China Scholarship Council,,1714972

Primary production resistance, the capacity to withstand change during extreme drought, and resilience, the degree to which production recovers, vary among and within ecosystem types, obscuring generalized patterns of ecological stability. Theory and many observations suggest forest production is more resistant but less resilient than grassland production to extreme drought; however, studies of production sensitivity to precipitation variability indicate that the processes controlling resistance and resilience may be influenced more by mean annual precipitation (MAP) than ecosystem type. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis to investigate primary production resistance and resilience to extreme drought in 64 forests and grasslands across a broad MAP gradient. We found resistance to extreme drought was predicted by MAP; however, grasslands (positive) and forests (negative) exhibited opposing resilience relationships with MAP. Our findings indicate that common plant physiological mechanisms may determine grassland and forest resistance to extreme drought, whereas differences among plant residents in turnover time, plant architecture, and drought adaptive strategies likely underlie divergent resilience patterns. The low resistance and resilience of dry grasslands suggests that these ecosystems are the most vulnerable to extreme drought – a vulnerability that is expected to compound as extreme drought frequency increases in the future.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60099391', 'afid': '60099391', 'affilname': 'Berner Fachhochschule', 'affiliation-city': 'Bern', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068865', 'afid': '60068865', 'affilname': 'Estonian Institute of Ecology', 'affiliation-city': 'Tartu', 'affiliation-country': 'Estonia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030840', 'afid': '60030840', 'affilname': 'Københavns Universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Copenhagen', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025488', 'afid': '60025488', 'affilname': 'The University of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023208', 'afid': '60023208', 'affilname': 'Universität Bayreuth', 'affiliation-city': 'Bayreuth', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023020', 'afid': '60023020', 'affilname': 'Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona', 'affiliation-city': 'Barcelona', 'affiliation-country': 'Spain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021311', 'afid': '60021311', 'affilname': 'Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald', 'affiliation-city': 'Greifswald', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012937', 'afid': '60012937', 'affilname': 'Universiteit Antwerpen', 'affiliation-city': 'Antwerpen', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009999', 'afid': '60009999', 'affilname': 'University of Innsbruck', 'affiliation-city': 'Innsbruck', 'affiliation-country': 'Austria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009500', 'afid': '60009500', 'affilname': 'University of Vermont', 'affiliation-city': 'Burlington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008607', 'afid': '60008607', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecology and Botany Hungarian Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Vacratot', 'affiliation-country': 'Hungary'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008588', 'afid': '60008588', 'affilname': 'Eidgenössische Forschungsanstalt fur Wald, Schnee Und Landschaft Eth-Bereichs', 'affiliation-city': 'Birmensdorf', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002476', 'afid': '60002476', 'affilname': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Stuart-Haëntjens E.', 'De Boeck H.J.', 'Lemoine N.P.', 'Mänd P.', 'Kröel-Dulay G.', 'Schmidt I.K.', 'Jentsch A.', 'Stampfli A.', 'Anderegg W.R.L.', 'Bahn M.', 'Kreyling J.', 'Wohlgemuth T.', 'Lloret F.', 'Classen A.T.', 'Gough C.M.', 'Smith M.D.']","['56868647400', '35232836500', '55013820400', '23493041800', '23008689300', '7103297632', '6602883636', '6603178741', '36169204100', '7003969980', '23488793800', '6602126402', '36003052700', '57206427749', '7004362252', '8947893100']",Extreme drought | Forest | Grassland | Primary productivity | Resilience | Resistance,USDOE,DE-SC0010562,U.S. Department of Energy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969718314670,1714972

Models for predicting this effect have been used in a wide variety of scientific and applied contexts, including recreation planning, search and rescue, wildland firefighter safety, social network analysis, and recreating historical human movement patterns. Despite their wide use, these models are based on datasets with very small sample sizes that were collected without using instantaneous measures of travel rate and assume symmetrical effects about the slope of maximum travel rate. These models also typically resulted in a single mathematical function, ignoring the significant variability that can occur between a fast and a slow individual, or between walking and running travel rates. In this study we modeled travel rates using a database of GPS tracks from 29,928 individuals representing 421,247 individual hikes, jogs, and runs on trails in and around Salt Lake City, Utah for an entire year between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Three widely-used probability distribution functions (Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz) were used to predict travel rates based on terrain slope along segments of trails with uniform slopes. To account for the variability in travel rates between fast and slow movement, a series of travel rate models were generated to predict travel rate percentiles, ranging from the 1st to the 99th, thus providing a flexible basis for predicting travel rates as a function of slope. The large number of samples allowed us to introduce a novel term that accounts for asymmetry in travel rates on uphill and downhill slopes. All three functions performed well, with Lorentz percentile models averaging an R 2 of 0.958 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.078 m/s, Laplace with R 2 of 0.953 and MAE of 0.088 m/s, and Gauss with R 2 of 0.949 and MAE of 0.090 m/s. All three functions performed notably better at estimating lower travel rate percentiles (e.g. 5th: R 2Lorentz = 0.941; R 2Laplace = 0.940; R 2Gauss = 0.934) as compared to higher (e.g. 95th: R 2Lorentz = 0.914; R 2Laplace = 0.913; R 2Gauss = 0.908), indicating greater consistency in walking rates than the fastest running rates. Lorentz outperformed the other functions for the widest range of percentiles (5th, 30 th -90 th ), and thus is recommended for use as a flexible travel rate prediction function. However, Laplace tended to produce the best results at moderately-low travel rate percentiles (10 th -25th), suggesting a combination of the two models could produce the highest accuracies. The results of this research provide a sound basis for future studies aiming to estimate travel rates while hiking or running along slopes.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025488', 'afid': '60025488', 'affilname': 'The University of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022772', 'afid': '60022772', 'affilname': 'USDA ARS Rocky Mountain Research Station', 'affiliation-city': 'Missoula', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016341', 'afid': '60016341', 'affilname': 'Fort Lewis College', 'affiliation-city': 'Durango', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Campbell M.', 'Dennison P.', 'Butler B.', 'Page W.']","['55574215367', '6701808065', '7202035366', '57200816814']",Fitness tracker | GPS data | Hiking | Least cost path | Running | Slope | Travel rate,NSF,18JV11221637154,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0143622818307859,1714972

Plants influence the atmosphere through fluxes of carbon, water and energy1, and can intensify drought through land–atmosphere feedback effects2–4. The diversity of plant functional traits in forests, especially physiological traits related to water (hydraulic) transport, may have a critical role in land–atmosphere feedback, particularly during drought. Here we combine 352 site-years of eddy covariance measurements from 40 forest sites, remote-sensing observations of plant water content and plant functional-trait data to test whether the diversity in plant traits affects the response of the ecosystem to drought. We find evidence that higher hydraulic diversity buffers variation in ecosystem flux during dry periods across temperate and boreal forests. Hydraulic traits were the predominant significant predictors of cross-site patterns in drought response. By contrast, standard leaf and wood traits, such as specific leaf area and wood density, had little explanatory power. Our results demonstrate that diversity in the hydraulic traits of trees mediates ecosystem resilience to drought and is likely to have an important role in future ecosystem–atmosphere feedback effects in a changing climate.",54,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025488', 'afid': '60025488', 'affilname': 'The University of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009164', 'afid': '60009164', 'affilname': 'UC Merced', 'affiliation-city': 'Merced', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Anderegg W.R.L.', 'Konings A.G.', 'Trugman A.T.', 'Yu K.', 'Bowling D.R.', 'Gabbitas R.', 'Karp D.S.', 'Pacala S.', 'Sperry J.S.', 'Sulman B.N.', 'Zenes N.']","['36169204100', '36198188600', '56509633200', '56060150600', '35978069700', '57204021609', '35193765500', '7005624522', '7006352443', '36544482000', '57204020878']",,NIFA,2018-67019-27850,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,,1714972

The primacy of past human activity in triggering change in earth’s ecosystems remains a contested idea. Treating human-environmental dynamics as a dichotomous phenomenon – turning “on” or “off” at some tipping point in the past – misses the broader, longer-term, and varied role humans play in creating lasting ecological legacies. To investigate these more subtle human-environmental dynamics, we propose an interdisciplinary framework, for evaluating past and predicting future landscape change focused on human-fire legacies. Linking theory and methods from behavioral and landscape ecology, we present a coupled framework capable of explaining how and why humans make subsistence decisions and interact with environmental variation through time. We review evidence using this framework that demonstrates how human behavior can influence vegetation cover and continuity, change local disturbance regimes, and create socio-ecological systems that can dampen or even override, the environmental effects of local and regional climate. Our examples emphasize how a long-term interdisciplinary perspective provides new insights for assessing the role of humans in generating persistent landscape legacies that go unrecognized using a simple natural-versus-human driver model of environmental change.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60159398', 'afid': '60159398', 'affilname': 'Natural History Museum of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025488', 'afid': '60025488', 'affilname': 'The University of Utah', 'affiliation-city': 'Salt Lake City', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065', 'afid': '60010065', 'affilname': 'The University of Arizona', 'affiliation-city': 'Tucson', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Short Survey,"['Power M.J.', 'Codding B.F.', 'Taylor A.H.', 'Swetnam T.W.', 'Magargal K.E.', 'Bird D.W.', 'O’connell J.F.']","['7102066641', '16416561900', '7405888110', '57053720400', '57193890269', '7201990432', '57194161073']",Anthropogenic fire | Behavioral ecology | Human legacy | Interdisciplinary | Paleoecology,NSF,DEB-1714972,National Science Foundation,,1714972

Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2%) were scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31%) are at low risk from all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3%, whereas the proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21%. For 13 species, the high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the 5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the possible outcomes of management alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110003877', 'afid': '110003877', 'affilname': 'Center for Ocean Solutions', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108615082', 'afid': '108615082', 'affilname': 'Oceana', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Micheli F.', 'De Leo G.', 'Butner C.', 'Martone R.', 'Shester G.']","['7101777512', '7006105591', '56223576500', '36957809800', '36024152800']",Coastal fisheries | Ecosystem-based management | Fishing impact | Productivity-susceptibility analysis | Risk assessment | Small-scale fisheries,NSF,OCE-0410439,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320714002274,1212124

Marine reserves (MRs)areusedworldwide as ameans of conservingbiodiversity and protecting depleted populations. Despite major investments in MRs, their environmental and social benefits have proven difficult to demonstrate and are still debated. Clear expectations of the possible outcomes of MR establishment are needed to guide and strengthen empirical assessments. Previous models show that reserve establishment in overcapitalized, quota-based fisheries can reduce both catch and population abundance, thereby negating fisheries and even conservation benefits. By using a stage-structured, spatially explicit stochastic model, we show that catches under quota-based fisheries that include a network of MRs can exceed maximum sustainable yield (MSY)under conventional quota management if reserves provide protection to old, large spawners that disproportionally contribute to recruitment outside the reserves. Modelling results predict that the net fishery benefit ofMRsis lostwhen gains in fecundity of old, large individuals are small, is highest in the case of sedentary adults with high larval dispersal, and decreases with adult mobility. We also show that environmental variability may mask fishery benefits of reserve implementation and that MRs may buffer against collapse when sustainable catch quotas are exceeded owing to stock overestimation or systematic overfishing.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['De Leo G.', 'Micheli F.']","['7006105591', '7101777512']",Demographic and management models | Large spawners | Marine reserves | Quota-based fisheries | Total allowable catches,,undefined,,,1212124

The goal of this program is to support the restoration and maintenance of healthy ecosystem states and thriving human communities as well as the improvement of whole social-ecological systems. © The Ecological Society of America.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029681', 'afid': '60029681', 'affilname': 'Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile', 'affiliation-city': 'Santiago', 'affiliation-country': 'Chile'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021746', 'afid': '60021746', 'affilname': 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas Del Noroeste', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010365', 'afid': '60010365', 'affilname': 'The University of British Columbia', 'affiliation-city': 'Vancouver', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009970', 'afid': '60009970', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002913', 'afid': '60002913', 'affilname': 'Environmental Defense Fund', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114479007', 'afid': '114479007', 'affilname': 'Manta Consulting', 'affiliation-city': 'Carmel', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112958717', 'afid': '112958717', 'affilname': 'Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108615082', 'afid': '108615082', 'affilname': 'Oceana', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Micheli F.', 'De Leo G.', 'Shester G.G.', 'Martone R.G.', 'Lluch-Cota S.E.', 'Butner C.', 'Crowder L.B.', 'Fujita R.', 'Gelcich S.', 'Jain M.', 'Lester S.E.', 'McCay B.', 'Pelc R.', 'Sáenz-Arroyo A.']","['7101777512', '7006105591', '36024152800', '36957809800', '6601930762', '56223576500', '7005270269', '7103049277', '8563637100', '56226587000', '8134852700', '6603824509', '34977238500', '57203596446']",,,undefined,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,,1212124

Acidification, deoxygenation, and warming are escalating changes in coastal waters throughout the world ocean, with potentially severe consequences for marine life and ocean-based economies. To examine the influence of these oceanographic changes on a key biological process, we measured the effects of current and expected future conditions in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem on the fertilization success of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). Laboratory experiments were used to assess abalone fertilization success during simultaneous exposure to various levels of seawater pH (gradient from 7.95 to 7.2), dissolved oxygen (DO) (∼60 and 180 μm.kg SW) and temperature (9, 13, and 18 °C). Fertilization success declined continuously with decreasing pH but dropped precipitously below a threshold near pH 7.55 in cool (9 ° C-upwelling) to average (13 °C) seawater temperatures. Variation in DO had a negligible effect on fertilization. In contrast, warmer waters (18 °C) often associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation conditions in central California acted antagonistically with decreasing pH, largely reducing the strong negative influence below the pH threshold. Experimental approaches that examine the interactive effects of multiple environmental drivers and also strive to characterize the functional response of organisms along gradients in environmental change are becoming increasingly important in advancing our understanding of the real-world consequences of changing ocean conditions.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Boch C.', 'Litvin S.', 'Micheli F.', 'De Leo G.', 'Aalto E.', 'Lovera C.', 'Woodson C.', 'Monismith S.', 'Barry J.']","['24477443200', '7003428713', '7101777512', '7006105591', '55793206500', '6507638447', '8944091400', '7004116809', '7402082701']",Climate change | Fertilization | Haliotis rufescens | Hypoxia | Multiple drivers | Ocean acidification | Ocean warming | Upwelling,,DEB-1212124,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,,1212124

Marine reserves (MRs)areusedworldwide as ameans of conservingbiodiversity and protecting depleted populations. Despite major investments in MRs, their environmental and social benefits have proven difficult to demonstrate and are still debated. Clear expectations of the possible outcomes of MR establishment are needed to guide and strengthen empirical assessments. Previous models show that reserve establishment in overcapitalized, quota-based fisheries can reduce both catch and population abundance, thereby negating fisheries and even conservation benefits. By using a stage-structured, spatially explicit stochastic model, we show that catches under quota-based fisheries that include a network of MRs can exceed maximum sustainable yield (MSY)under conventional quota management if reserves provide protection to old, large spawners that disproportionally contribute to recruitment outside the reserves. Modelling results predict that the net fishery benefit ofMRsis lostwhen gains in fecundity of old, large individuals are small, is highest in the case of sedentary adults with high larval dispersal, and decreases with adult mobility. We also show that environmental variability may mask fishery benefits of reserve implementation and that MRs may buffer against collapse when sustainable catch quotas are exceeded owing to stock overestimation or systematic overfishing.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['De Leo G.', 'Micheli F.']","['7006105591', '7101777512']",Demographic and management models | Large spawners | Marine reserves | Quota-based fisheries | Total allowable catches,,undefined,,,1212124

Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2%) were scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31%) are at low risk from all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3%, whereas the proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21%. For 13 species, the high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the 5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the possible outcomes of management alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110003877', 'afid': '110003877', 'affilname': 'Center for Ocean Solutions', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108615082', 'afid': '108615082', 'affilname': 'Oceana', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Micheli F.', 'De Leo G.', 'Butner C.', 'Martone R.', 'Shester G.']","['7101777512', '7006105591', '56223576500', '36957809800', '36024152800']",Coastal fisheries | Ecosystem-based management | Fishing impact | Productivity-susceptibility analysis | Risk assessment | Small-scale fisheries,NSF,OCE-0410439,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320714002274,1212124

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Climate change is warming, deoxygenating, and acidifying the ocean at an unprecedented rate. However, responses to large-scale forcing are variable at relatively small spatial scales, creating marine microclimates. Marine microclimates can provide spatial refuges (safe spaces) or local adaptation that may be harnessed to improve marine conservation and management. We analyze multiyear data sets within two fishing cooperatives in Baja California, Mexico, to quantify small-scale ocean variability, describe the degree to which this variability affects the abundance of species, and discuss the potential for marine microclimates to improve conservation and management efforts. We find that variation in ocean conditions and species abundances at scales of a few kilometers is striking and robust to large-scale climate forcing. We posit that incorporation of marine microclimates into fisheries management and conservation efforts can improve ecosystem sustainability by allowing local adaptation and maintenance of spatial refuges in the face of climate change.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121765', 'afid': '60121765', 'affilname': 'El Colegio de la Frontera Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'San Cristobal de las Casas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113216827', 'afid': '113216827', 'affilname': 'Comunidad y Biodiversidad', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112959034', 'afid': '112959034', 'affilname': 'Sociedad Cooperativa de Produccion Pesquera Buzos y Pescadores', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Woodson C.B.', 'Micheli F.', 'Boch C.', 'Al-Najjar M.', 'Espinoza A.', 'Hernandez A.', 'Vázquez-Vera L.', 'Saenz-Arroyo A.', 'Monismith S.G.', 'Torre J.']","['8944091400', '7101777512', '24477443200', '57204510267', '57201457812', '57204513826', '57198780330', '57203596446', '7004116809', '8941306800']",climate forcing | environmental variability | fisheries | local conservation | marine microclimates,NSF,OCE-1737090,Walton Family Foundation,,1212124

ABSTRACT: There is active debate on gender issues in natural resource management. For example, it is proposed that women are more cooperative than men when dealing with natural resources decisions; however, few scientific studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. We provide evidence for a greater cooperative attitude in women compared to men in both college students and coastal fishing communities of Baja California, Mexico, by means of game theory experiments. In both laboratory and field experiments, women changed their behaviour towards lower extraction compared to men, when regulations, sanctions or social scolding were introduced in the games. These results suggest that raising the role of women in decision-making, along with an adequate institutional framework, may lead to a more sustainable use of natural resources.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121765', 'afid': '60121765', 'affilname': 'El Colegio de la Frontera Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'San Cristobal de las Casas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Revollo-Fernández D.', 'Aguilar-Ibarra A.', 'Micheli F.', 'Sáenz-Arroyo A.']","['55745596700', '7007005880', '7101777512', '57203596446']",Experimental economics | gender economics | natural resources | sustainable behaviour,CONACYT,81653,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a,,1212124

Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) aims to support the protection of natural ecosystems and to improve economic activities. It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species’ centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss. We identified species (e.g., Octopus sp. and the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) whose protection could further decrease the risk of potential negative impacts of fishing activities on the Baja California Sur food web. This work introduces an approach that can be applied to other ecosystems to aid the implementation of EBM in data-poor contexts.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60079129', 'afid': '60079129', 'affilname': 'GEOMAR - Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung Kiel', 'affiliation-city': 'Kiel', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004969', 'afid': '60004969', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Parma', 'affiliation-city': 'Parma', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rocchi M.', 'Scotti M.', 'Micheli F.', 'Bodini A.']","['57191584717', '7003580815', '7101777512', '7004447726']",Centrality indices | Ecosystem-Based Management | Food webs | Network analysis | Overfishing | Small-Scale Fisheries,NSF,DEB-1212124,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0924796316303190,1212124

Climate change is causing warming, deoxygenation, and acidification of the global ocean. However, manifestation of climate change may vary at local scales due to oceanographic conditions. Variation in stressors, such as high temperature and low oxygen, at local scales may lead to variable biological responses and spatial refuges from climate impacts. We conducted outplant experiments at two locations separated by ~2.5 km and two sites at each location separated by ~200 m in the nearshore of Isla Natividad, Mexico to assess how local ocean conditions (warming and hypoxia) may affect juvenile abalone performance. Here, we show that abalone growth and mortality mapped to variability in stress exposure across sites and locations. These insights indicate that management decisions aimed at maintaining and recovering valuable marine species in the face of climate change need to be informed by local variability in environmental conditions.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60099904', 'afid': '60099904', 'affilname': 'Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC', 'affiliation-city': 'Guaymas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120490750', 'afid': '120490750', 'affilname': 'Sociedad Cooperativa de Producción Pesquera la Purisima', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112959034', 'afid': '112959034', 'affilname': 'Sociedad Cooperativa de Produccion Pesquera Buzos y Pescadores', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Article,"['Boch C.', 'Micheli F.', 'Alnajjar M.', 'Monismith S.', 'Beers J.', 'Bonilla J.', 'Espinoza A.', 'Vazquez-Vera L.', 'Woodson C.']","['24477443200', '7101777512', '57201465827', '7004116809', '36190519000', '57201460194', '57201457812', '57198780330', '8944091400']",,,DEB-1212124,Walton Family Foundation,,1212124

Marine reserves (MRs)areusedworldwide as ameans of conservingbiodiversity and protecting depleted populations. Despite major investments in MRs, their environmental and social benefits have proven difficult to demonstrate and are still debated. Clear expectations of the possible outcomes of MR establishment are needed to guide and strengthen empirical assessments. Previous models show that reserve establishment in overcapitalized, quota-based fisheries can reduce both catch and population abundance, thereby negating fisheries and even conservation benefits. By using a stage-structured, spatially explicit stochastic model, we show that catches under quota-based fisheries that include a network of MRs can exceed maximum sustainable yield (MSY)under conventional quota management if reserves provide protection to old, large spawners that disproportionally contribute to recruitment outside the reserves. Modelling results predict that the net fishery benefit ofMRsis lostwhen gains in fecundity of old, large individuals are small, is highest in the case of sedentary adults with high larval dispersal, and decreases with adult mobility. We also show that environmental variability may mask fishery benefits of reserve implementation and that MRs may buffer against collapse when sustainable catch quotas are exceeded owing to stock overestimation or systematic overfishing.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['De Leo G.', 'Micheli F.']","['7006105591', '7101777512']",Demographic and management models | Large spawners | Marine reserves | Quota-based fisheries | Total allowable catches,,undefined,,,1212124

All rights reserved. Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = -0.018 y-1). Our analysis identified declines in 38% of ecoregions for which there are data (-0.015 to -0.18 y-1), increases in 27% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y-1), and no detectable change in 35% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.",151,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113037', 'afid': '60113037',

Just as tide pools in the rocky intertidal zone persist in depressions following the relaxation of surface waves and tides, “internal tide pools” persist in depressions in the subtidal reef following the relaxation of internal waves. When internal waves contain low dissolved oxygen (DO) water, the duration of hypoxic events can be extended for organisms within the pooling zone. Additionally, we suggest that internal wave run-up can cause the early arrival of cold hypoxic water in these same areas, thereby extending hypoxic events further. Together, internal tide pools and wave run-up extend event durations by 20% on average. However, some events are extended up to 160% of the regional-scale event length, which may be more ecologically relevant than the mean extension. When internal waves contain other environmental covariates (e.g., low pH, nutrients), internal tide pools are expected to create a similar time extension and patchy landscape in these quantities. We attribute the slowing of the relaxation of sub-thermocline water within pooling zones to retention within the reef itself rather than a drag effect of the kelp bed. Following hypoxic internal bores, internal tide pools cause a period of extreme spatial variability in the DO and temperature field which is likely to impact the distribution and behavior of local organisms.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033012', 'afid': '60033012', 'affilname': 'Naval Postgraduate School', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Leary P.', 'Woodson C.', 'Squibb M.', 'Denny M.', 'Monismith S.', 'Micheli F.']","['57031575800', '8944091400', '56490984600', '24443956200', '7004116809', '7101777512']",,,undefined,,,1212124

Ocean acidification (OA) increasingly threatens marine systems, and is especially harmful to calcifying organisms. One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO2 levels ranging from 419-2,013 μatm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-Algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO2 treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO2, abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO2. Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000000', 'afid': '60000000', 'affilname': 'Bodega Marine Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodega Bay', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118904065', 'afid': '118904065', 'affilname': 'United States of America', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodega Bay', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"[""O'Leary J.K."", 'Barry J.P.', 'Gabrielson P.W.', 'Rogers-Bennett L.', 'Potts D.C.', 'Palumbi S.R.', 'Micheli F.']","['36682814500', '7402082701', '14050091400', '6603629871', '7102258522', '7004573915', '7101777512']",,,undefined,,,1212124

Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Climate change is warming, deoxygenating, and acidifying the ocean at an unprecedented rate. However, responses to large-scale forcing are variable at relatively small spatial scales, creating marine microclimates. Marine microclimates can provide spatial refuges (safe spaces) or local adaptation that may be harnessed to improve marine conservation and management. We analyze multiyear data sets within two fishing cooperatives in Baja California, Mexico, to quantify small-scale ocean variability, describe the degree to which this variability affects the abundance of species, and discuss the potential for marine microclimates to improve conservation and management efforts. We find that variation in ocean conditions and species abundances at scales of a few kilometers is striking and robust to large-scale climate forcing. We posit that incorporation of marine microclimates into fisheries management and conservation efforts can improve ecosystem sustainability by allowing local adaptation and maintenance of spatial refuges in the face of climate change.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121765', 'afid': '60121765', 'affilname': 'El Colegio de la Frontera Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'San Cristobal de las Casas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113216827', 'afid': '113216827', 'affilname': 'Comunidad y Biodiversidad', 'affiliation-city': 'La Paz', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112959034', 'afid': '112959034', 'affilname': 'Sociedad Cooperativa de Produccion Pesquera Buzos y Pescadores', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}]",Journal,Letter,"['Woodson C.B.', 'Micheli F.', 'Boch C.', 'Al-Najjar M.', 'Espinoza A.', 'Hernandez A.', 'Vázquez-Vera L.', 'Saenz-Arroyo A.', 'Monismith S.G.', 'Torre J.']","['8944091400', '7101777512', '24477443200', '57204510267', '57201457812', '57204513826', '57198780330', '57203596446', '7004116809', '8941306800']",climate forcing | environmental variability | fisheries | local conservation | marine microclimates,NSF,OCE-1737090,Walton Family Foundation,,1212124

Diversity and Distributions published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Aim: Species distribution modelling is a useful tool for determining important habitats. By accounting for specific animal behaviour in the model, it is possible to identify finer-scale patterns of habitat use. Together with spatially explicit data on anthropogenic activities, models can be used to assess human impacts and inform conservation management. This study used observations of breeding behaviour to identify fine-scale breeding habitats of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), as well as potential overlap of these habitats with cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Location: Eastern Tropical Atlantic, West Africa. Methods: Maxent was used to model humpback distribution using pertinent environmental predictors and an integrated dataset of humpback whale occurrences filtered for breeding-specific behaviours. In conjunction with multiple anthropogenic activities, a subsequent cumulative utilization and impact analysis assessed the degree of overlap between predicted breeding habitat and potential anthropogenic impacts. Results: Greatest habitat suitability occurred in warm coastal waters of Gabon, and other highly suitable areas occurred off Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), Cameroon and Angola. Sea surface temperature and height contributed most to the model. Highest overlap between humpback whales and potential impacts from anthropogenic activities occurred off Gabon, Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), Cameroon and Angola. Impacts associated with oil and gas development (where oil and gas platforms serve as an indicator for industry activity) appeared to contribute most to potential cumulative impact. Main Conclusions: Depth and sea surface temperature of predicted breeding habitats were consistent with previous studies. However, lesser known characteristics such as sea surface height and wind speed, resulting in potentially more sheltered areas for breeding whales, may also be important in delineating finer-scale habitat suitability. Identified areas of high potential cumulative impact occurred within exclusive economic zones of multiple countries and likely represent the minimum level of impact to humpback whales in the region, highlighting the need for additional research and effective management throughout the area.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030162', 'afid': '60030162', 'affilname': 'Columbia University in the City of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016643', 'afid': '60016643', 'affilname': 'University of Washington-Bothell', 'affiliation-city': 'Bothell', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001012', 'afid': '60001012', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100698691', 'afid': '100698691', 'affilname': 'Natural Resources Defense Council', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chou E.', 'Kershaw F.', 'Maxwell S.M.', 'Collins T.', 'Strindberg S.', 'Rosenbaum H.C.']","['57212513395', '55765715700', '36970062400', '12807662100', '6508171334', '35556623900']",anthropogenic activity | breeding habitat | cumulative impacts | Gulf of Guinea | humpback whale | Maxent | species distribution models,WCS,undefined,Wildlife Conservation Society,,1212124

Kelp forests are highly productive systems that are important ecologically and commercially as well as in a blue carbon perspective. Given their importance, there is an urgent need to achieve reliable estimates of the spatial distribution of their biomass. Species distribution modelling is a powerful tool for producing such estimates, but it requires a solid framework, including important environmental covariates that have a direct effect on their biomass, a proper sampling strategy, and an independent evaluation dataset. Using Laminaria hyperborea as a model species, we developed a modelling framework considering these requirements and necessary steps to produce reliable predictions. Our modelling framework included proportion of hard substrate and bottom wave exposure, both crucial covariates that have a direct effect on the biomass of L. hyperborea, but rarely included in modelling studies. Furthermore, we devised a sampling strategy with field observations covering the whole environmental covariate space present in the study area. Subsequently, we fitted GAMs relating the field observations of the biomass of L. hyperborea to relevant environmental covariates. The best model containing the predictors bottom wave exposure, depth, and proportion hard substrate explained most of the variance in the dataset (83.1% deviance explained). This model was then used to predict the spatial distribution of biomass across the whole study area. To assess the reliability of the biomass predictions, we used an independent dataset of L. hyperborea biomass observations from the same area. This independent dataset correlated very well with spatial predictions of biomass based on our best model (R = 0.85). In total, we predicted a biomass of 457,000 tonnes in a 1,150 km2 study area on the West coast of Norway. Our modelling framework provides the means for developing a biomass model on a broader geographical scale. Such a model will be invaluable in improving kelp management regimes as well as for estimating the contribution of kelp forests to ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and climate budgets.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023659', 'afid': '60023659', 'affilname': 'Havforskningsinstituttet', 'affiliation-city': 'Bergen', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019471', 'afid': '60019471', 'affilname': 'Meteorologisk institutt', 'affiliation-city': 'Oslo', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014500', 'afid': '60014500', 'affilname': 'Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut', 'affiliation-city': 'Copenhagen', 'affiliation-country': 'Denmark'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007049', 'afid': '60007049', 'affilname': 'Norges geologiske undersekelse', 'affiliation-city': 'Trondheim', 'affiliation-country': 'Norway'}]",Journal,Article,"['van Son T.C.', 'Nikolioudakis N.', 'Steen H.', 'Albretsen J.', 'Furevik B.R.', 'Elvenes S.', 'Moy F.', 'Norderhaug K.M.']","['22136682600', '21741019000', '7101612137', '22940080900', '6602409978', '55754967800', '7004389876', '6507116533']",biomass modelling | bottom wave exposure | independent evaluation | Laminaria hyperborea | management | sampling strategy | species distribution modelling,,undefined,,,1212124

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Marine reserves are implemented to achieve a variety of objectives, but are seldom rigorously evaluated to determine whether those objectives are met. In the rare cases when evaluations do take place, they typically focus on ecological indicators and ignore other relevant objectives such as socioeconomics and governance. And regardless of the objectives, the diversity of locations, monitoring protocols, and analysis approaches hinder the ability to compare results across case studies. Moreover, analysis and evaluation of reserves is generally conducted by outside researchers, not the reserve managers or users, plausibly thereby hindering effective local management and rapid response to change.

All rights reserved. Internal waves are widespread features of global oceans that play critical roles in mixing and thermohaline circulation. Similarly to surface waves, internal waves can travel long distances, ultimately breaking along continental margins. These breaking waves can transport deep ocean water and associated constituents (nutrients, larvae, and acidic low-oxygen waters) onto the shelf and locally enhance turbulence and mixing, with important effects on nearshore ecosystems. We are only beginning to understand the role internal waves play in shaping nearshore ecosystems. Here, I review the physics of internal waves in shallow waters and identify two commonalities among internal waves in the nearshore: exposure to deep offshore waters and enhanced turbulence and mixing. I relate these phenomena to important ecosystem processes ranging from extreme events to fertilization success to draw general conclusions about the influence of internal waves on ecosystems and the effects of internal waves in a changing climate.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,['Woodson C.'],['8944091400'],ecosystem effects | exposure | internal waves | multiple stressors | nearshore | turbulence,,OCE-1416837,National Science Foundation,,1212124

Ocean acidification (OA) increasingly threatens marine systems, and is especially harmful to calcifying organisms. One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO2 levels ranging from 419-2,013 μatm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-Algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO2 treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO2, abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO2. Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000000', 'afid': '60000000', 'affilname': 'Bodega Marine Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodega Bay', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118904065', 'afid': '118904065', 'affilname': 'United States of America', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodega Bay', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"[""O'Leary J.K."", 'Barry J.P.', 'Gabrielson P.W.', 'Rogers-Bennett L.', 'Potts D.C.', 'Palumbi S.R.', 'Micheli F.']","['36682814500', '7402082701', '14050091400', '6603629871', '7102258522', '7004573915', '7101777512']",,,undefined,,,1212124

DO in sub-mixed layer nearshore waters (≤ 10 km from shore) have declined up to four times faster than reported for offshore waters over the last 15 yr. These trends were evident over depth, and along isopycnals. They have no precedent over the past 50 yr and do not appear to be attributable primarily to large-scale climate variability in ocean DO. Coastal biophysical processes, including increased phytoplankton biomass in surface waters, are likely contributing to the recent elevated rate of DO decline in nearshore waters, as evidenced by higher rates of increase in apparent oxygen utilization.

We utilize a novel behavioral approach – dynamic common-pool resource economic experiments in the field – and apply it to small-scale fisheries as a system that is particularly vulnerable to global change. Contrary to previous research, we find that when faced with higher uncertainty, resource users are choosing to reduce harvest to compensate for potential future declines. Correlates of this behavior include the capacity for social learning, previous exposure to uncertainty, and strong local institutions. These findings have important implications for any local system facing increased uncertainty from global change.

Climate drivers can impact ecosystem structure and processes by changing the composition of organisms through lethal impacts, or by altering the ecological roles of organisms through sublethal physiological and behavioral impacts. We examined potential effects of upwelling-driven hypoxia on California Current kelp forests by assessing hypoxia impacts on 2 species having important functional roles in these ecosystems. We quantified dissolved oxygen (DO) thresholds for lethal and functional-role impacts in purple and red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Mesocentrotus franciscanus). For both species in 2 size classes, we measured median lethal exposure time to severe hypoxia of 1.0 mg l-1 of DO, and quantified grazing at 7.5 (ambient), 6.5, 5.5, and 4.5 mg l-1 DO. Sea urchins of both species and size classes were tolerant of severe hypoxia, but showed 39 to 47% declines in grazing at 5.5 mg l-1 DO. We compared these thresholds to a decade-long dataset of DO in a Monterey Bay kelp forest and found that sea urchins are unlikely to experience direct mortality under current or near-future exposures to upwelling-driven hypoxia. In contrast, they are likely to experience sublethal effects of low oxygen and decreased grazing rates for substantial periods of time under current conditions. These results represent the first documentation of hypoxia-modulated kelp grazing in sea urchins. They indicate that upwelling-driven hypoxia can have important impacts on these ecologically important benthic grazers and possibly on whole ecosystems through altered trophic interactions, highlighting that sublethal, functional-role impacts of climate drivers can be as or more important than lethal impacts.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Low N.', 'Micheli F.']","['56816520600', '7101777512']",Functional roles | Hypoxia | Kelp forests | Sea urchins | Sublethal | Thresholds,,DEB 121214,,,1212124

Size generally dictates metabolic requirements, trophic level, and consequently, ecosystem structure, where inefficient energy transfer leads to bottom-heavy ecosystem structure and biomass decreases as individual size (or trophic level) increases. However, many animals deviate from simple size-based predictions by either adopting generalist predatory behavior, or feeding lower in the trophic web than predicted from their size. Here we show that generalist predatory behavior and lower trophic feeding at large body size increase overall biomass and shift ecosystems from a bottom-heavy pyramid to a top-heavy hourglass shape, with the most biomass accounted for by the largest animals. These effects could be especially dramatic in the ocean, where primary producers are the smallest components of the ecosystem. This approach makes it possible to explore and predict, in the past and in the future, the structure of ocean ecosystems without biomass extraction and other impacts.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Woodson C.', 'Schramski J.', 'Joye S.']","['8944091400', '12765841300', '7004744633']",,GoMRI,OCE-1212124,Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative,,1212124

Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = -0.018 y-1). Our analysis identified declines in 38% of ecoregions for which there are data (-0.015 to -0.18 y-1), increases in 27% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y-1), and no detectable change in 35% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.",151,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113037', 'afid': '60113037',

The intensity and frequency of climate-driven disturbances are increasing in coastal marine ecosystems. Understanding the factors that enhance or inhibit ecosystem resilience to climatic disturbance is essential. We surveyed 97 experts in six major coastal biogenic ecosystem types to identify ""bright spots"" of resilience in the face of climate change. We also evaluated literature that was recommended by the experts that addresses the responses of habitat-forming species to climatic disturbance. Resilience was commonly reported in the expert surveys (80% of experts). Resilience was observed in all ecosystem types and at multiple locations worldwide. The experts and literature cited remaining biogenic habitat, recruitment/connectivity, physical setting, and management of local-scale stressors as most important for resilience. These findings suggest that coastal ecosystems may still hold great potential to persist in the face of climate change and that local-To regional-scale management can help buffer global climatic impacts.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117630', 'afid': '60117630', 'affilname': 'Lancaster Environment Centre', 'affiliation-city': 'Lancaster', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218', 'afid': '60028218', 'affilname': 'Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna', 'affiliation-city': 'Bologna', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006683', 'afid': '60006683', 'affilname': 'California State University, Monterey Bay', 'affiliation-city': 'Marina', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114813190', 'afid': '114813190', 'affilname': 'Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"[""O'Leary J.K."", 'Micheli F.', 'Airoldi L.', 'Boch C.', 'De Leo G.', 'Elahi R.', 'Ferretti F.', 'Graham N.A.J.', 'Litvin S.Y.', 'Low N.H.', 'Lummis S.', 'Nickols K.J.', 'Wong J.']","['36682814500', '7101777512', '7005912553', '24477443200', '7006105591', '15925007200', '57203543373', '8503393500', '7003428713', '56816520600', '57207585878', '37120746500', '56514469300']",Biogenic Habitat | Conservation And Management | Persistence | Recovery | Resistance,,undefined,,,1212124

Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) aims to support the protection of natural ecosystems and to improve economic activities. It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species’ centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss.

ABSTRACT: There is active debate on gender issues in natural resource management. For example, it is proposed that women are more cooperative than men when dealing with natural resources decisions; however, few scientific studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. We provide evidence for a greater cooperative attitude in women compared to men in both college students and coastal fishing communities of Baja California, Mexico, by means of game theory experiments. In both laboratory and field experiments, women changed their behaviour towards lower extraction compared to men, when regulations, sanctions or social scolding were introduced in the games. These results suggest that raising the role of women in decision-making, along with an adequate institutional framework, may lead to a more sustainable use of natural resources.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121765', 'afid': '60121765', 'affilname': 'El Colegio de la Frontera Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'San Cristobal de las Casas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Revollo-Fernández D.', 'Aguilar-Ibarra A.', 'Micheli F.', 'Sáenz-Arroyo A.']","['55745596700', '7007005880', '7101777512', '57203596446']",Experimental economics | gender economics | natural resources | sustainable behaviour,CONACYT,81653,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a,,1212124

They face ecological changes due to the increased frequency and severity of droughts and rising energy demands; trends that entail economic costs for both nations and major implications for human wellbeing. We describe an ongoing effort by the Environment Working Group (EWG), created by The University of California's UC-Mexico initiative in 2015, to promote binational research, teaching, and outreach collaborations on the implications of climate change for Mexico and California. We synthesize current knowledge about the most pressing issues related to climate change in the US-Mexico border region and provide examples of cross-border discoveries and research initiatives, highlighting the need to move forward in six broad rubrics. This and similar binational cooperation efforts can lead to improved living standards, generate a collaborative mindset among participating universities, and create an international network to address

Climate change is causing warming, deoxygenation, and acidification of the global ocean. However, manifestation of climate change may vary at local scales due to oceanographic conditions. Variation in stressors, such as high temperature and low oxygen, at local scales may lead to variable biological responses and spatial refuges from climate impacts. We conducted outplant experiments at two locations separated by ~2.5 km and two sites at each location separated by ~200 m in the nearshore of Isla Natividad, Mexico to assess how local ocean conditions (warming and hypoxia) may affect juvenile abalone performance.

Managing for sustainable development and resource extraction requires an understanding of the feedbacks between ecosystems and humans. These feedbacks are part of complex social-ecological systems (SES), in which resources, actors, and governance systems interact to produce outcomes across these component parts. Qualitative modeling approaches offer ways to assess complex SES dynamics. Loop analysis in particular is useful for examining and identifying potential outcomes from external perturbations and management interventions in data poor systems when very little is known about functional relationships and parameter values. Using a case study of multispecies, multifleet coastal small-scale fisheries, we demonstrate the application of loop analysis to provide predictions regarding SES responses to perturbations and management actions. Specifically, we examine the potential ecological and socioeconomic consequences to coastal fisheries of different governance interventions (e.g., territorial user rights, fisheries closures, market-based incentives, ecotourism subsidies) and environmental changes. Our results indicate that complex feedbacks among biophysical and socioeconomic components can result in counterintuitive and unexpected outcomes. For example, creating new jobs through ecotourism or subsidies might have mixed effects on members of fishing cooperatives vs. nonmembers, highlighting equity issues. Market-based interventions, such as ecolabels, are expected to have overall positive economic effects, assuming a direct effect of ecolabels on marketprices, and a lack of negative biological impacts under most model structures. Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique unit of management can reveal important potential trade-offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes, highlight which user groups might be more vulnerable to external shocks, and identify which interventions should be further tested to identify potential win-win outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004969', 'afid': '60004969', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Parma', 'affiliation-city': 'Parma', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}]",Journal,Article,"['Martone R.', 'Bodini A.', 'Micheli F.']","['36957809800', '7004447726', '7101777512']",Ecosystem-based management | Loop analysis | Small-scale fisheries | Social-ecological systems | Trade-offs,NSF,OCE-0410439,National Science Foundation,,1212124

Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2%) were scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31%) are at low risk from all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3%, whereas the proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21%. For 13 species, the high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the 5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the possible outcomes of management alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110003877', 'afid': '110003877', 'affilname': 'Center for Ocean Solutions', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108615082', 'afid': '108615082', 'affilname': 'Oceana', 'affiliation-city': 'Monterey', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Micheli F.', 'De Leo G.', 'Butner C.', 'Martone R.', 'Shester G.']","['7101777512', '7006105591', '56223576500', '36957809800', '36024152800']",Coastal fisheries | Ecosystem-based management | Fishing impact | Productivity-susceptibility analysis | Risk assessment | Small-scale fisheries,NSF,OCE-0410439,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320714002274,1212124

Contrary to previous research, we find that when faced with higher uncertainty, resource users are choosing to reduce harvest to compensate for potential future declines. Correlates of this behavior include the capacity for social learning, previous exposure to uncertainty, and strong local institutions.

ABSTRACT: There is active debate on gender issues in natural resource management. For example, it is proposed that women are more cooperative than men when dealing with natural resources decisions; however, few scientific studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. We provide evidence for a greater cooperative attitude in women compared to men in both college students and coastal fishing communities of Baja California, Mexico, by means of game theory experiments. In both laboratory and field experiments, women changed their behaviour towards lower extraction compared to men, when regulations, sanctions or social scolding were introduced in the games. These results suggest that raising the role of women in decision-making, along with an adequate institutional framework, may lead to a more sustainable use of natural resources.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121765', 'afid': '60121765', 'affilname': 'El Colegio de la Frontera Sur', 'affiliation-city': 'San Cristobal de las Casas', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032442', 'afid': '60032442', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México', 'affiliation-city': 'Ciudad de México', 'affiliation-country': 'Mexico'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Revollo-Fernández D.', 'Aguilar-Ibarra A.', 'Micheli F.', 'Sáenz-Arroyo A.']","['55745596700', '7007005880', '7101777512', '57203596446']",Experimental economics | gender economics | natural resources | sustainable behaviour,CONACYT,81653,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a,,1212124

Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) aims to support the protection of natural ecosystems and to improve economic activities. It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species’ centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss. We identified species (e.g., Octopus sp. and the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) whose protection could further decrease the risk of potential negative impacts of fishing activities on the Baja California Sur food web.

Ocean acidification (OA) increasingly threatens marine systems, and is especially harmful to calcifying organisms. One important question is whether OA will alter species interactions. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) provide space and chemical cues for larval settlement. CCA have shown strongly negative responses to OA in previous studies, including disruption of settlement cues to corals. In California, CCA provide cues for seven species of harvested, threatened, and endangered abalone. We exposed four common CCA genera and a crustose calcifying red algae, Peyssonnelia (collectively CCRA) from California to three pCO2 levels ranging from 419-2,013 μatm for four months. We then evaluated abalone (Haliotis rufescens) settlement under ambient conditions among the CCRA and non-Algal controls that had been previously exposed to the pCO2 treatments. Abalone settlement and metamorphosis increased from 11% in the absence of CCRA to 45-69% when CCRA were present, with minor variation among CCRA genera. Though all CCRA genera reduced growth during exposure to increased pCO2, abalone settlement was unaffected by prior CCRA exposure to increased pCO2. Thus, we find no impacts of OA exposure history on CCRA provision of settlement cues. Additionally, there appears to be functional redundancy in genera of CCRA providing cues to abalone, which may further buffer OA effects.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024941', 'afid': '60024941', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Cruz', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011116', 'afid': '60011116', 'affilname': 'Cal Poly San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis Obispo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000000', 'afid': '60000000', 'affilname': 'Bodega Marine Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodega Bay', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118904065', 'afid': '118904065', 'affilname': 'United States of America', 'affiliation-city': 'Bodega Bay', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"[""O'Leary J.K."", 'Barry J.P.', 'Gabrielson P.W.', 'Rogers-Bennett L.', 'Potts D.C.', 'Palumbi S.R.', 'Micheli F.']","['36682814500', '7402082701', '14050091400', '6603629871', '7102258522', '7004573915', '7101777512']",,,undefined,,,1212124

Flexible statistical and machine learning models like random forests have thus been used as an alternative modeling approach to identify important stressors and to make spatial predictions of their combined effects. However, tests of such models’ prediction skill have been limited. Therefore, we tested how well ten statistical and machine learning methods predicted three ecological indicators of coastal marine ecosystem condition (kelp biodiversity, fish biomass, and rocky intertidal biodiversity) off California, USA. Spatial data representing anthropogenic stressors and ocean uses as well as natural gradients were used as predictors. The models’ prediction errors were estimated by double spatial block cross-validation. The best models achieved mean squared errors about 25% lower than a null model for kelp biodiversity and fish biomass; none of the tested models worked well for rocky intertidal biodiversity. The models captured general trends, but not local variability of the indicators. For kelp biodiversity, the best performing method was principal components regression. For fish biomass, the best performing method was boosted regression trees. However, after tuning, this model did not include any interactions between stressors, and ridge regression (a constrained linear model) performed almost as well. While in theory flexible machine learning methods are required to represent the complex stressor-ecosystem state relationships revealed by experimental ecologists, with our data, this flexibility could not be harnessed because more flexible models overfitted due to small sample sizes and low signal-to-noise ratio. The main challenge for harnessing the flexibility of statistical and machine learning methods to link ecological indicators and anthropogenic stressors is obtaining more suitable data. In particular, better data describing the spatial and temporal distribution of human uses and stressors are needed. We conclude by discussing methodological implications for future research.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033021', 'afid': '60033021', 'affilname': 'The University of New Mexico', 'affiliation-city': 'Albuquerque', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033011', 'afid': '60033011', 'affilname': 'Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory', 'affiliation-city': 'Palisades', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006683', 'afid': '60006683', 'affilname': 'California State University, Monterey Bay', 'affiliation-city': 'Marina', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Stock A.', 'Haupt A.', 'Mach M.', 'Micheli F.']","['56896871900', '23968842500', '36625854800', '7101777512']",Cumulative impacts | Kelp forests | Model selection | Multiple stressors | Regression | Spatial prediction,GBMF,DEB-1212124,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1574954118300736,1212124

Acidification, deoxygenation, and warming are escalating changes in coastal waters throughout the world ocean, with potentially severe consequences for marine life and ocean-based economies. To examine the influence of these oceanographic changes on a key biological process, we measured the effects of current and expected future conditions in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem on the fertilization success of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). Laboratory experiments were used to assess abalone fertilization success during simultaneous exposure to various levels of seawater pH (gradient from 7.95 to 7.2), dissolved oxygen (DO) (∼60 and 180 μm.kg SW) and temperature (9, 13, and 18 °C). Fertilization success declined continuously with decreasing pH but dropped precipitously below a threshold near pH 7.55 in cool (9 ° C-upwelling) to average (13 °C) seawater temperatures. Variation in DO had a negligible effect on fertilization. In contrast, warmer waters (18 °C) often associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation conditions in central California acted antagonistically with decreasing pH, largely reducing the strong negative influence below the pH threshold. Experimental approaches that examine the interactive effects of multiple environmental drivers and also strive to characterize the functional response of organisms along gradients in environmental change are becoming increasingly important in advancing our understanding of the real-world consequences of changing ocean conditions.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708', 'afid': '60012708', 'affilname': 'Stanford University', 'affiliation-city': 'Palo Alto', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005458', 'afid': '60005458', 'affilname': 'Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Moss Landing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Boch C.', 'Litvin S.', 'Micheli F.', 'De Leo G.', 'Aalto E.', 'Lovera C.', 'Woodson C.', 'Monismith S.', 'Barry J.']","['24477443200', '7003428713', '7101777512', '7006105591', '55793206500', '6507638447', '8944091400', '7004116809', '7402082701']",Climate change | Fertilization | Haliotis rufescens | Hypoxia | Multiple drivers | Ocean acidification | Ocean warming | Upwelling,,DEB-1212124,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,,1212124

The transformation of coral reefs has profound implications for millions of people. However, the interactive effects of changing reefs and fishing remain poorly resolved. We combine underwater surveys (271 000 fishes), catch data (18 000 fishes), and household surveys (351 households) to evaluate how reef fishes and fishers in Moorea, French Polynesia responded to a landscape-scale loss of coral caused by sequential disturbances (a crown-of-thorns sea star outbreak followed by a category 4 cyclone). Although local communities were aware of the disturbances, less than 20% of households reported altering what fishes they caught or ate. This contrasts with substantial changes in the taxonomic composition in the catch data that mirrored changes in fish communities observed on the reef. Our findings highlight that resource users and scientists may have very different interpretations of what constitutes ‘change’ in these highly dynamic social–ecological systems, with broad implications for successful co-management of coral reef fisheries.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027946', 'afid': '60027946', 'affilname': 'École Pratique des Hautes Etudes', 'affiliation-city': 'Paris', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002092', 'afid': '60002092', 'affilname': 'Florida State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tallahassee', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119729355', 'afid': '119729355', 'affilname': 'Laboratoire d’Excellence CORAIL', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'French Polynesia'}]",Journal,Article,"['Rassweiler A.', 'Lauer M.', 'Lester S.E.', 'Holbrook S.J.', 'Schmitt R.J.', 'Madi Moussa R.', 'Munsterman K.S.', 'Lenihan H.S.', 'Brooks A.J.', 'Wencélius J.', 'Claudet J.']","['8673550900', '12783444400', '8134852700', '7004637899', '7201439382', '36195067200', '57207620135', '6701862230', '7202568637', '55503230300', '8275355900']",Coral reef resilience | Disturbance | Fisheries | Local knowledge | Selectivity | Social–ecological feedbacks,NSF,OCE 1637396,National Science Foundation,,1714704

In this context of rapid change, effective site-based management of coral reef fisheries necessitates flexible environmental governance that is closely attuned to the needs of multiple stakeholders who depend on the fishery for income, food, and cultural identity. As such, many practitioners and scholars call for adaptive co-management of coral reef fisheries where local resource users play a primary role in environmental governance with the support of flexible institutions that operate across organizational scales. This article describes the history and evaluates the current status of marine governance in Moorea, French Polynesia. Established in 2004, the management framework is under revision because it has failed to meet its ecological objectives and has generated discontent among many stakeholders. Drawing on household surveys, interviews, and archival information, the challenges to as well as the factors that may enable a more successful transition of the current governance arrangement towards co-management are detailed. It is argued that recent social mobilization, subsistence and cultural links to the fishery, the presence of geographically and socially relevant traditional governance boundaries, and the implementation of co-management in other parts of French Polynesia are positive factors. However, lack of trust between stakeholders, social heterogeneity, disruption of traditional cultural institutions and practices, minimal institutional support, and an uncertain legal framework suggest that there are significant headwinds for maneuvering towards successful co-management in Moorea.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002092', 'afid': '60002092', 'affilname': 'Florida State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tallahassee', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hunter C.', 'Lauer M.', 'Levine A.', 'Holbrook S.', 'Rassweiler A.']","['57204000373', '12783444400', '7401603671', '7004637899', '8673550900']",Adaptive management | Biodiversity conservation | Conflict | Devolution | Marine governance | Pacific,NSF,OCE 1637396,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0308597X18304585,1714704

Our goal was to test the hypothesis that mortality rate is negatively related to the abundance of littoral coarse woody habitat, which ranged from 3 to 1500 pieces of wood per kilometre of shoreline in these lakes. Instantaneous mortality rates were well-constrained and ranged from 0.04 to 0.19 among the 13 lakes. Mortality was not related to coarse woody habitat abundance.

It is important to understand recreational anglers’ motivations for fishing in order to predict when, where, and how they interact with species that can be sensitive to overfishing. So far, few studies have investigated angler motivation in recreational fisheries that are extremely distant from their angler population, require specialized angler skill, and pose other barriers to participation like high travel and equipment costs. We collectively refer to these as “high-threshold” fisheries and explore angler motivation and its implications for anglers’ decision-making in one particularly remote example, the Mongolian fly fishery for endangered taimen, Hucho taimen, the largest salmonid in the world. We used a mixed-methods approach that enriched discrete choice experiments with in-depth qualitative interview data to investigate anglers’ motivations for participating in the taimen fishery, their satisfaction with the fishing experience, and their stated interest in participating in the fishery in the future. We found that anglers preferred fewer high-quality, trophy-sized fish to a higher catch rate of smaller taimen, but that activity-general factors like the opportunity to travel to an “exotic” wilderness destination were also highly motivating. The anglers we sampled were all first-time taimen fishermen and many were bucket-list anglers who sought a wide variety of fishing tourism experiences throughout their lifetime and therefore and had no intention to return to the taimen fishery. Instead, these fishermen selected their future trips from among a set of similarly remote, specialized, and costly fisheries throughout the world, especially in developing countries. We argue that these high-threshold fisheries should not be studied in isolation but instead would benefit from a unified research approach that accounts for their unique traits and shared angler population.",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Golden A.', 'Free C.', 'Jensen O.']","['56707027600', '55900547100', '9242529900']","Angler preferences, motivation, and satisfaction | Catch-and-release fly fishing | Discrete choice experiment | Hucho taimen | Mixed quantitative-qualitative methods | Mongolia",NSF,1716066,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016578361930219X,1716066

Wildfire risk in temperate forests has become a nearly intractable problem that can be characterized as a socioecological ""pathology"": that is, a set of complex and problematic interactions among social and ecological systems across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Assessments of wildfire risk could benefit from recognizing and accounting for these interactions in terms of socioecological systems, also known as coupled natural and human systems (CNHS). We characterize the primary social and ecological dimensions of the wildfire risk pathology, paying particular attention to the governance system around wildfire risk, and suggest strategies to mitigate the pathology through innovative planning approaches, analytical tools, and policies. We caution that even with a clear understanding of the problem and possible solutions, the system by which human actors govern fire-prone forests may evolve incrementally in imperfect ways and can be expected to resist change even as we learn better ways to manage CNHS.",63,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033389', 'afid': '60033389', 'affilname': 'University of Idaho', 'affiliation-city': 'Moscow', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032280', 'afid': '60032280', 'affilname': 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023908', 'afid': '60023908', 'affilname': 'Portland State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Portland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022462', 'afid': '60022462', 'affilname': 'University of New England, USA', 'affiliation-city': 'Biddeford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020633', 'afid': '60020633', 'affilname': 'University of Louisville', 'affiliation-city': 'Louisville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017536', 'afid': '60017536', 'affilname': 'Southern Methodist University', 'affiliation-city': 'Dallas', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015356', 'afid': '60015356', 'affilname': 'University of Tasmania', 'affiliation-city': 'Hobart', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015186', 'afid': '60015186', 'affilname': 'University of Saskatchewan', 'affiliation-city': 'Saskatoon', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012317', 'afid': '60012317', 'affilname': 'University of Oregon', 'affiliation-city': 'Eugene', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011520', 'afid': '60011520', 'affilname': ""King's College London"", 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Fischer A.', 'Spies T.', 'Steelman T.', 'Moseley C.', 'Johnson B.', 'Bailey J.', 'Ager A.', 'Bourgeron P.', 'Charnley S.', 'Collins B.', 'Kline J.', 'Leahy J.', 'Littell J.', 'Millington J.', 'Nielsen-Pincus M.', 'Olsen C.', 'Paveglio T.', 'Roos C.', 'Steen-Adams M.', 'Stevens F.', 'Vukomanovic J.', 'White E.', 'Bowman D.']","['57190244323', '57205464667', '6602907512', '7005222720', '55474608400', '7404350683', '7005143995', '6602881070', '14065724500', '7201875945', '7201770151', '15923418100', '6701373250', '8248988800', '15822262200', '16316670300', '24338896400', '43061437300', '9245253400', '41762789100', '18038980100', '8903988900', '7202508742']",,,undefined,,,1313688

This theoretical model includes forested polygons in various states of 'harvest readiness' and three types of agents: forest landowners, foresters, and peer leaders (individuals trained in conservation who use peer-to-peer networking). Agent rules, interactions, and characteristics were parameterized with values from existing literature and an empirical survey of forest landowner attitudes, intentions, and demographics. The model demonstrates that as trust in foresters and peer leaders increases, the percentage of the forest that is harvested sustainably increases. Furthermore, peer leaders can serve to increase landowner trust in foresters. Model output and equations will inform forest policy and extension/outreach efforts.

However, measuring terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity in the field is extremely laborious and expensive. Optical remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to map terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity over large areas ranging from regions to the entire globe in a repeated, cost-efficient manner. This progress report reviews the theory and practice of mapping terrestrial primary productivity using optical remotely sensed data. Terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity is generally estimated with optical remote sensing via one of the following approaches: (1) empirical estimation from spectral vegetation indices; (2) models that are based on light-use-efficiency (LUE) theory; (3) models that are not based on LUE theory, but the biophysical processes of plant photosynthesis. Among these three, models based on LUE are the primary approach because there is a solid physical basis for the linkage between fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and remotely sensed spectral signatures of vegetation. There has been much inconsistency in the literature with regard to the appropriate value for LUE. This issue should be resolved with the ongoing efforts aimed at direct mapping of LUE from remote sensing. At the same time, major efforts have been dedicated to mapping vegetation canopy biochemical composition via imaging spectroscopy for use in process-based models to estimating primary productivity. In so doing, optical remote sensing will continue to play a vital role in global carbon cycle science research. © The Author(s) 2013.",39,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015487', 'afid': '60015487', 'affilname': 'Anhui Agricultural University', 'affiliation-city': 'Hefei', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Song C.', 'Dannenberg M.', 'Hwang T.']","['7403252718', '55894282100', '24168104700']",gross primary productivity | light-use-efficiency | net primary productivity | optical remote sensing | terrestrial ecosystem models,NSF,1313756,National Science Foundation,,1313756

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sustainability of SLCP forests and the program's impacts on the livelihoods of the participating farmers based on data collected from household surveys in Anhui, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces. Overall, it seems likely that the areas will remain as forests in the near and medium future, with the possibility for the forests to be later reconverted back to croplands varying significantly across the three sites. The SLCP is associated with minor improvements in the livelihoods for a majority of participating farmers, and offers a significant safety net for households that are poor. We also found that farmers are overwhelmingly positive toward the program. To sustain these successes, continued monitoring of the forests is needed as current factors determining the success of the program may change.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Light use efficiency (LUE) is a key biophysical parameter characterizing the ability of plants to convert absorbed light to carbohydrate. However, the environmental regulations on LUE, especially moisture stress, are poorly understood, leading to large uncertainties in primary productivity estimated by LUE models. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of moisture stress on LUE for a wide range of ecosystems on daily, 8 day, and monthly scales. Using the FLUXNET and Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiometer data, we evaluated moisture stress along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, including soil water content (SWC) and soil water saturation (SWS), land surface wetness index (LSWI) and plant evaporative fraction (EF), and precipitation and daytime atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We found that LUE was most responsive to plant moisture indicators (EF and LSWI), least responsive to soil moisture (SWC and SWS) variations with the atmospheric indicator (VPD) falling in between. LUE showed higher sensitivity to SWC than VPD only for grassland ecosystems. For evergreen forest, LUE had better association with VPD than LSWI. All moisture indicators (except soil indicators) were generally less effective in affecting LUE on the daily and 8 day scales than on the monthly scale. Our study highlights the complexity of moisture stress on LUE and suggests that a single moisture indicator or function in LUE models is not sufficient to capture the diverse responses of vegetation to moisture stress. LUE models should consider the variability identified in this study to more realistically reflect the environmental controls on ecosystem functions.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021200', 'afid': '60021200', 'affilname': 'East China Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang Y.', 'Song C.', 'Sun G.', 'Band L.', 'Noormets A.', 'Zhang Q.']","['51865191500', '7403252718', '7402760408', '7005637276', '6603378706', '57203621187']",FLUXNET | GPP | LUE | MODIS | moisture stress | soil-plant-atmosphere continuum,,DEB-1313756,,,1313756

Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) are two key ecosystem fluxes in the global carbon and water cycles. As carbon and water fluxes are inherently linked, knowing one provides information for the other. However, tightly coupled and easy to use ecosystem models are rare and there are still large uncertainties in global carbon and water flux estimates. In this study, we developed a new monthly coupled carbon and water (CCW) model. GPP was estimated based on the light-use efficiency (LUE) theory that considered the effect of diffuse radiation, while ET was modeled based on GPP and water-use efficiency (WUE). We evaluated the non-linear effect of single (GPPOR) or combined (GPPAND) limitations of temperature and vapor pressure deficit on GPP. We further compared the effects of three types of WUE (i.e., WUE, inherent WUE, and underlying WUE) on ET (i.e., ETWUE, ETIWUE and ETUWUE). CCW was calibrated and validated using global eddy covariance measurement from FLUXNET and remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2007. Modeled GPPAND and GPPOR explained 67.3% and 66.8% of variations of tower-derived GPP, respectively, while ETUWUE, ETIWUE and ETWUE explained 65.7%, 59.9% and 58.1% of tower-measured ET, respectively. Consequently, we chose GPPAND and ETUWUE as the best modeling framework for CCW, and estimated global GPP as 134.2 Pg C yr-1 and ET as 57.0 × 103 km3 for vegetated areas in 2001. Global ET estimated by CCW compared favorably with MODIS ET (60.5 × 103 km3) and ET derived from global precipitation (56.5 × 103 km3). However, global GPP estimated by CCW was about 19% higher than MODIS GPP (109.0 Pg C yr-1). The mean global WUE value estimated by CCW (2.35 g C kg-1 H2O) was close to the mean tower-based WUE (2.60 g C kg-1 H2O), but was much higher than the WUE derived from MODIS products (1.80 g C kg-1 H2O).

Classifying land cover is perhaps the most common application of remote sensing, yet classification at frequent temporal intervals remains a challenging task due to radiometric differences among scenes, time and budget constraints, and semantic differences among class definitions from different dates. The automatic adaptive signature generalization (AASG) algorithm overcomes many of these limitations by locating stable sites between two images and using them to adapt class spectral signatures from a high-quality reference classification to a new image, which mitigates the impacts of radiometric and phenological differences between images and ensures that class definitions remain consistent between the two classifications. We refined AASG to adapt stable site identification parameters to each individual land cover class, while also incorporating improved input data and a random forest classifier. In the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, our new version of AASG demonstrated an improved ability to update existing land cover classifications compared to the initial version of AASG, particularly for low intensity developed, mixed forest, and woody wetland classes. Topographic indices were particularly important for distinguishing woody wetlands from other forest types, while multi-seasonal imagery contributed to improved classification of water, developed, forest, and hay/pasture classes. These results demonstrate both the flexibility of the AASG algorithm and the potential for using it to produce high-quality land cover classifications that can utilize the entire temporal range of the Landsat archive in an automated fashion while maintaining consistent class definitions through time.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dannenberg M.', 'Hakkenberg C.', 'Song C.']","['55894282100', '26422131100', '7403252718']",Classification | Land cover and land use change (LCLUC) | Landsat | National Land Cover Database (NLCD) | Random forest | Signature extension | Time series | Topography,,undefined,,,1313756

Here, the driving forces of green consumerism and two domestic energy uses (electricity consumption and vehicle fuel use) are compared. This study found that environmental attitudes predicted green consumerism, but not electricity consumption or vehicle fuel use. Furthermore, green consumerism was correlated with income and individual level demographic factors, while energy consumption was primarily predicted by household size and structural constraints. Because household energy consumption has greater environmental impacts than green consumerism, policies that aim to improve pro-environmental attitudes may not be effective in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Policies should rather aim to change structural constraints influencing transportation and household energy decisions and improve the conspicuousness of household energy consumption.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069743', 'afid': '60069743', 'affilname': 'China West Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Nanchong', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018308', 'afid': '60018308', 'affilname': ""Xi'an Jiaotong University"", 'affiliation-city': ""Xi'an"", 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Chen X.', 'De La Rosa J.', 'Peterson M.N.', 'Zhong Y.', 'Lu C.']","['36552055500', '57057143500', '7402271586', '57056849800', '54789923900']",energy consumption | environmental behaviour | environmental impacts | green consumerism | pro-environmental attitude,UNC,DEB-1313756,University of North Carolina,,1313756

Vegetation phenology manifests the rhythm of annual plant life activities. It has been extensively studied in natural ecosystems. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the impacts of urbanization on vegetation phenology. This study addresses two questions to fill the knowledge gaps: (1) How does vegetation phenology vary spatially and temporally along a rural-to-urban transect in Shanghai, China, over the past three decades? (2) How do landscape composition and configuration affect those variations of vegetation phenology? To answer these questions, 30 m × 30 m mean vegetation phenology metrics, including the start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS), were derived for urban vegetation using dense stacks of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series from images collected by Landsat 5-8 satellites from 1984 to 2015. Landscape pattern metrics were calculated using high spatial resolution aerial photos. We then used Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the associations between phenology patterns and landscape metrics. We found that vegetation in urban centers experienced advances of SOS for 5-10 days and delays of EOS for 5-11 days compared with those located in the surrounding rural areas. Additionally, we observed strong positive correlations between landscape composition (percentage of landscape area) of developed land and LOS of urban vegetation. We also found that the landscape configuration of local land cover types, especially patch density and edge density, was significantly correlated with the spatial patterns of vegetation phenology. These results demonstrate that vegetation phenology in the urban area is significantly different from its rural surroundings. These findings have implications for urban environmental management, ranging from biodiversity protection to public health risk reduction.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021200', 'afid': '60021200', 'affilname': 'East China Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100416361', 'afid': '100416361', 'affilname': 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urbanization and Ecological Restoration', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Qiu T.', 'Song C.', 'Li J.']","['57195755721', '7403252718', '56901722000']",EVI | Landscape metrics | Rural-to-urban gradient | Urban landscape | Urban phenology,NSFC,DEB-1313756,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,1313756

China has been implementing the world's most ambitious afforestation and forest conservation programs and undergoing rapid forest expansion since 1990s, thus, understanding the forest dynamics in China has global implications for sustainable forest management. Through analyzing forest area, biomass dynamics, and factors influencing deforestation and forest restoration, we found that the natural disasters and economic development drove forest dynamics and transition in China. The growth of the economy and population drove up demand for forest products, facilitating deforestation. The booming economy also boosted government's investment in forest restoration and conservation programs. Natural disasters damaged and frequently destroyed forests, but they also served as stimuli for the authorities to adopt remedy forestry policies and programs that ultimately led to forest increase. Nationwide, increasing peaks of annual afforestation were observed in the late 1950s, early 1980s, and early 2000s, and the newly increased area closed for forest restoration reached the peak in 1998. All these peaks were closely associated with peaks of natural disasters (i.e., floods, drought, and dust storm events). Based on the dynamics of forest area, biomass and forest consumption over the past 40 years, forest transition occurred during the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and it also strengthened the carbon (C) sink function of forests in China (with an increasing rate of 0.137 Pg C yr.−1 during 1994–2008).

Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) are two key ecosystem fluxes in the global carbon and water cycles. As carbon and water fluxes are inherently linked, knowing one provides information for the other. However, tightly coupled and easy to use ecosystem models are rare and there are still large uncertainties in global carbon and water flux estimates. In this study, we developed a new monthly coupled carbon and water (CCW) model. GPP was estimated based on the light-use efficiency (LUE) theory that considered the effect of diffuse radiation, while ET was modeled based on GPP and water-use efficiency (WUE). We evaluated the non-linear effect of single (GPPOR) or combined (GPPAND) limitations of temperature and vapor pressure deficit on GPP. We further compared the effects of three types of WUE (i.e., WUE, inherent WUE, and underlying WUE) on ET (i.e., ETWUE, ETIWUE and ETUWUE). CCW was calibrated and validated using global eddy covariance measurement from FLUXNET and remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2007. Modeled GPPAND and GPPOR explained 67.3% and 66.8% of variations of tower-derived GPP, respectively, while ETUWUE, ETIWUE and ETWUE explained 65.7%, 59.9% and 58.1% of tower-measured ET, respectively. Consequently, we chose GPPAND and ETUWUE as the best modeling framework for CCW, and estimated global GPP as 134.2 Pg C yr-1 and ET as 57.0 × 103 km3 for vegetated areas in 2001. Global ET estimated by CCW compared favorably with MODIS ET (60.5 × 103 km3) and ET derived from global precipitation (56.5 × 103 km3). However, global GPP estimated by CCW was about 19% higher than MODIS GPP (109.0 Pg C yr-1). The mean global WUE value estimated by CCW (2.35 g C kg-1 H2O) was close to the mean tower-based WUE (2.60 g C kg-1 H2O), but was much higher than the WUE derived from MODIS products (1.80 g C kg-1 H2O). We concluded that the new simple CCW model provided improved estimates of GPP and ET. The biome-specific parameters derived in this study allow CCW to be further linked with land use change models to project human impacts on terrestrial ecosystem functions.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021200', 'afid': '60021200', 'affilname': 'East China Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006782', 'afid': '60006782', 'affilname': 'Beijing Forestry University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang Y.', 'Song C.', 'Sun G.', 'Band L.', 'McNulty S.', 'Noormets A.', 'Zhang Q.', 'Zhang Z.']","['51865191500', '7403252718', '7402760408', '7005637276', '7005497884', '6603378706', '57203621187', '35278945900']",CCW | Evapotranspiration | FLUXNET | Gross primary productivity | Light-use efficiency | MODIS | Water-use efficiency,UNC,DEB-1313756,University of North Carolina,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0168192316302349,1313756

Using the FLUXNET and Moderate Resolution Imagine Spectroradiometer data, we evaluated moisture stress along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, including soil water content (SWC) and soil water saturation (SWS), land surface wetness index (LSWI) and plant evaporative fraction (EF), and precipitation and daytime atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We found that LUE was most responsive to plant moisture indicators (EF and LSWI), least responsive to soil moisture (SWC and SWS) variations with the atmospheric indicator (VPD) falling in between. LUE showed higher sensitivity to SWC than VPD only for grassland ecosystems. For evergreen forest, LUE had better association with VPD than LSWI. All moisture indicators (except soil indicators) were generally less effective in affecting LUE on the daily and 8 day scales than on the monthly scale. Our study highlights the complexity of moisture stress on LUE and suggests that a single moisture indicator or function in LUE models is not sufficient to capture the diverse responses of vegetation to moisture stress. LUE models should consider the variability identified in this study to more realistically reflect the environmental controls on ecosystem functions.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021200', 'afid': '60021200', 'affilname': 'East China Normal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499', 'afid': '60019499', 'affilname': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004923', 'afid': '60004923', 'affilname': 'NC State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Raleigh', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang Y.', 'Song C.', 'Sun G.', 'Band L.', 'Noormets A.', 'Zhang Q.']","['51865191500', '7403252718', '7402760408', '7005637276', '6603378706', '57203621187']",FLUXNET | GPP | LUE | MODIS | moisture stress | soil-plant-atmosphere continuum,,DEB-1313756,,,1313756

The use of Landsat data to answer ecological questions is greatly increased by the effective removal of cloud and cloud shadow from satellite images. We develop a novel algorithm to identify and classify clouds and cloud shadow, SPARCS: Spatial Procedures for Automated Removal of Cloud and Shadow. The method uses a neural network approach to determine cloud, cloud shadow, water, snow/ice and clear sky classification memberships of each pixel in a Landsat scene. It then applies a series of spatial procedures to resolve pixels with ambiguous membership by using information, such as the membership values of neighboring pixels and an estimate of cloud shadow locations from cloud and solar geometry. In a comparison with FMask, a high-quality cloud and cloud shadow classification algorithm currently available, SPARCS performs favorably, with substantially lower omission errors for cloud shadow (8.0% and 3.2%), only slightly higher omission errors for clouds (0.9% and 1.3%, respectively) and fewer errors of commission (2.6% and 0.3%). Additionally, SPARCS provides a measure of uncertainty in its classification that can be exploited by other algorithms that require clear sky pixels. To illustrate this, we present an application that constructs obstruction-free composites of images acquired on different dates in support of a method for vegetation change detection.",73,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015574', 'afid': '60015574', 'affilname': 'The University of Tennessee, Knoxville', 'affiliation-city': 'Knoxville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003029', 'afid': '60003029', 'affilname': 'ORNL Environmental Sciences Division', 'affiliation-city': 'Oak Ridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Hughes M.', 'Hayes D.']","['56697819500', '36788174700']",Cloud detection | Image analysis | Landsat | Neural networks,NASA,undefined,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,1211142

One of the most striking characteristics of protected areas is how much they vary in size. We examine the consequences of this size variation for the cost of acquiring protected areas. We use recent land acquisitions (2000-2009) in central and southern Appalachian forest ecosystems of the United States. Acquisition costs for these protected areas show pronounced economies of scale; specifically ten times the area can be purchased for seven times the cost of a smaller site. We examine how these economies of scale differ by contract type and motivations. For example, we find that easements do not show economies of scale despite costing less than fee simple acquisitions overall. Also, we find that economies of scale are stronger for protected areas that were specifically created to protect occurrences of rare or imperiled species but where development pressure was not identified as an explicit threat to the site. Conservation organizations may better account for acquisition costs in protected area creation by recognizing such economies of scale and their context dependency with respect to land acquisition contract type and conservation motivations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112891548', 'afid': '112891548', 'affilname': 'University of Tennessee', 'affiliation-city': 'Chattanooga', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kim T.', 'Cho S.H.', 'Larson E.R.', 'Armsworth P.R.']","['55918647400', '22940061400', '35234061500', '9134106600']",Acquisition costs | Conservation planning | Cost effectiveness | Economies of scale | Nature reserve | Protected area size | Single large or several small,TNC,1211142,Nature Conservancy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0921800914002316,1211142

Facing tight resource constraints, conservation organizations must allocate funds available for habitat protection as effectively as possible. Often, they combine spatially referenced economic and biodiversity data to prioritize land for protection. We tested how sensitive these prioritizations could be to differences in the spatial grain of these data by demonstrating how the conclusion of a classic debate in conservation planning between cost and benefit targeting was altered based on the available information. As a case study, we determined parcel-level acquisition costs and biodiversity benefits of land transactions recently undertaken by a nonprofit conservation organization that seeks to protect forests in the eastern United States. Then, we used hypothetical conservation plans to simulate the types of ex ante priorities that an organization could use to prioritize areas for protection. We found the apparent effectiveness of cost and benefit targeting depended on the spatial grain of the data used when prioritizing parcels based on local species richness. However, when accounting for complementarity, benefit targeting consistently was more efficient than a cost targeting strategy regardless of the spatial grain of the data involved. More pertinently for other studies, we found that combining data collected over different spatial grains inflated the apparent effectiveness of a cost targeting strategy and led to overestimation of the efficiency gain offered by adopting a more integrative return-on-investment approach.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015574', 'afid': '60015574', 'affilname': 'The University of Tennessee, Knoxville', 'affiliation-city': 'Knoxville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sutton N.', 'Armsworth P.']","['56428832100', '9134106600']",Land trust | Opportunity | Scale dependence | Systematic conservation planning | Value of information,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1211142

A fundamental principal of savanna fire ecology is that the fire regime determines vegetation cover, especially as it pertains to trees. A corollary is that late fires are more damaging to trees than early fires. Much evidence in support of this principle has been derived from a series of long-term burning experiments based on the pioneering work of André Aubréville. Eighty years ago, Aubréville devised an experiment to study the impacts of fire on savanna trees in Africa. The design conventions of this study remain highly influential. It is now clear, however, that the dates chosen by Aubréville and his followers do not reflect the burning practices of West African people. Dates that were chosen for “early” and “late” are not representative of actual fire timing; they represent extremes. This study has four goals: (i) to critically review the results of the burning experiments; (ii) to examine them in the context of results from recent savanna fire studies; (iii) to evaluate their limitations based on data for actual burning practices and fires from West Africa; and (iv) to critically evaluate the use of the early/late terminology in contemporary fire research. We find the majority of West African fires occur during the “middle” of the fire season. Our field studies find that fire temperature and burn completeness are highest in the middle-season. We conclude that the early/late fire dichotomy is not sufficient for understanding the impacts of anthropogenic fires in the region and we make suggestions for rethinking its use more broadly.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033080', 'afid': '60033080', 'affilname': 'The California State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Long Beach', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118086868', 'afid': '118086868', 'affilname': 'Institut Polytechnique Rural de Katibougou', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'South Africa'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114983554', 'afid': '114983554', 'affilname': 'Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'South Africa'}]",Journal,Article,"['Laris P.', 'Koné M.', 'Dadashi S.', 'Dembele F.']","['57203633533', '57193265321', '55349511000', '6506275071']",Africa | burning experiments | critical physical geography | fire | fire timing | Savanna,,undefined,,,1313820

According to contemporary ecological theory, the mechanisms governing tree cover in savannas vary by precipitation level. In tropical areas with mesic rainfall levels, savannas are unstable systems in which disturbances, such as fire, determine the ratio of trees to grasses. Precipitation in these so-called “disturbance-driven savannas” is sufficient to support forest but frequent disturbances prevent transition to a closed canopy state. Building on a savanna buffering model we argue that a consistent fire regime is required to maintain savannas in mesic areas. We hypothesize that the spatiotemporal pattern of fires is highly regular and stable in these areas. Furthermore, because tree growth rates in savannas are a function of precipitation, we hypothesize that savannas with the highest rainfall levels will have the most consistent fire pattern and the most intense fires—thus the strongest buffering mechanisms. We analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of burning over 11 years for a large subset of the West African savanna using a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer active fire product to document the fire regime for three savanna belts with different precipitation levels. We used LISA analysis to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of fires, coefficient of variance to quantify differences in peak fire dates, and center or gravity pathways to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of the fires for each area. Our analysis confirms that spatiotemporal regularity of the fire regime is greater for mesic areas that for areas where precipitation is lower and that areas with more precipitation have more regular fire regimes.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029378', 'afid': '60029378', 'affilname': 'California State University Long Beach', 'affiliation-city': 'Long Beach', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Laris P.', 'Dadashi S.', 'Jo A.', 'Wechsler S.']","['57203633533', '55349511000', '56548473100', '8965072100']",Africa | Buffering model | Disequilibrium | Fire regime | Savanna,,undefined,,,1313820

Because of the density of ticks and the many pathogens that they vector, cattle in East Africa are often treated with acaricides. While acaricides are known to be effective at reducing tick burdens on cattle, their effects on the overall abundance and community composition of ticks in savanna ecosystems are less well understood. It is also not known how well tick populations can be maintained in the absence of large mammals. We evaluated the effects of wildlife and of acaricide-treated cattle on hostseeking tick populations in a long-term, exclusion experiment in central Kenya. Over seven years, we sampled larval, nymphal, and adult ticks monthly on replicated treatment plots that controlled for the presence of cattle and for the presence of two guilds of large wild mammals: megaherbivores (giraffes and elephants) and all other large wild herbivores (>15 kg). Two species of ticks were found in this habitat; across all surveys, 93% were Rhipicephalus pulchellus and 7% were R. praetextatus. The presence of acaricide-treated cattle dramatically reduced the abundance of host-seeking nymphal and adult ticks but did not affect the abundance of hostseeking larval ticks. The abundance of larval ticks was determined by the presence of large wild mammals, which appear to import gravid female ticks into the experimental plots. On plots with no large mammals, either wild or domestic, larval and nymphal ticks were rare. Adult R. pulchellus were most abundant in plots that allowed wildlife but excluded cattle. Adult R. praetextatus were relatively abundant in plots without any large mammals. These differences suggest that these ticks utilize different members of the host community. The reduction in ticks that results from the presence of acaricide-treated cattle has potential health benefits for humans and wildlife, but these benefits must be weighed against potential costs, including reduced availability of food for birds such as oxpeckers that feed on ticks. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010828', 'afid': '60010828', 'affilname': 'Bard College', 'affiliation-city': 'Red Hook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Keesing F.', 'Allan B.', 'Young T.', 'Ostfeld R.']","['6701906870', '7102506146', '55755053200', '7006957295']",Amitraz | Cattle | Kenya | Kenya Long-Term Exclusion Experiment | KLEE | Parasite | Parasitism | Rhipicephalus praetextatus | Rhipicephalus pulchellus | Tick | Ungulate | Vector | Wildlife,NSF,0196177,National Science Foundation,,1313822

The experimental removal of large grazing mammals set into motion a cascade of consequences, beginning with the doubling in abundance of a small grazing mammal, the pouched mouse (Saccostomus mearnsi). The presence of abundant mice attracted venomous snakes such as the olive hissing snake (Psammophis mossambicus); devastated seedlings of the dominant tree (Acacia drepanolobium); and doubled the abundance of fleas, which potentially increased the risk of transmission of flea-borne pathogens.

Despite the established importance of rodents as reservoirs of vector-borne zoonoses in East Africa, there is relatively limited information regarding the infestation parameters and host associations of ectoparasites that vector many such pathogens among small mammals in this region. Between 2009 and 2013, small mammals were live-trapped in the semiarid savanna of Kenya. A subset of these individual hosts, including 20 distinct host taxa, was examined for ectoparasites, which were identified to species. Species of fleas, ticks, mites, and sucking lice were recorded. Based on these data, we calculated host-specific infestation parameters, documented host preferences among ectoparasites, conducted a rarefaction analysis and extrapolation to determine if ectoparasites were adequately sampled, and assessed nestedness for fleas to understand how pathogens might spread in this system. We found that the flea community structure was significantly nested. Understanding the ectoparasite network structure may have significant human relevance, as at least seven of the ectoparasite species collected are known vectors of pathogens of medical importance in the region, including Yersinia pestis, Rickettsia spp., and Theileria parva, the causative agents of plague, spotted fevers and other rickettsial illnesses in humans, and theileriosis, respectively.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60037596', 'afid': '60037596', 'affilname': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliation-city': 'Nairobi', 'affiliation-country': 'Kenya'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032083', 'afid': '60032083', 'affilname': 'University at Buffalo, The State University of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'Buffalo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241', 'afid': '60029241', 'affilname': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Barbara', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020059', 'afid': '60020059', 'affilname': 'Georgia Southern University', 'affiliation-city': 'Statesboro', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007670', 'afid': '60007670', 'affilname': 'Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007244', 'afid': '60007244', 'affilname': 'Northern Virginia Community College', 'affiliation-city': 'Annandale', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004862', 'afid': '60004862', 'affilname': 'University of Arkansas - Fayetteville', 'affiliation-city': 'Fayetteville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110315649', 'afid': '110315649', 'affilname': 'Armed Forces Pest Management Board', 'affiliation-city': 'Silver Spring', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Guerra A.S.', 'Eckerlin R.P.', 'Dowling A.P.G.', 'Durden L.A.', 'Robbins R.G.', 'Dittmar K.', 'Helgen K.M.', 'Agwanda B.', 'Allan B.F.', 'Hedlund T.', 'Young H.S.']","['56273050300', '56535132300', '7006290404', '7005284066', '7202460338', '57205989202', '6602538000', '24075534400', '7102506146', '57191614039', '36017871700']",ectoparasite | flea | louse | mite | tick,NSF,DEB-09-09670,National Science Foundation,,1313822

Cattle were collared with i-gotU loggers to track fine-scale and broad-scale movements within an integrated ecosystem (cattle and wildlife) in Laikipia, central Kenya. At the fine scale, cattle exerted a significant impact on vegetation quantity and quality; increasing grazing intensity showed a negative relationship to grass height, but a positive correlation to green-up after rain. At the broad scale, cattle movement density varied notably by herd type and habitat availability, with acacia woodland and savanna grassland habitats used most predominantly.

Capturing heterogeneity in contact patterns in animal populations is essential for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. In contrast to other regions of the world in which livestock movement networks are integral to pathogen prevention and control policies, contact networks are understudied in pastoral regions of Africa due to the challenge of measuring contact among mobile herds of cattle whose movements are driven by access to resources. Furthermore, the extent to which seasonal changes in the distribution of water and resources impacts the structure of contact networks in cattle is uncertain. Contact networks may be more conducive to pathogen spread in the dry season due to congregation at limited water sources. Alternatively, less abundant forage may result in decreased pathogen transmission due to competitive avoidance among herds, as measured by reduced contact rates. Here, we use GPS technology to concurrently track 49 free-roaming cattle herds within a semi-arid region of Kenya, and use these data to characterize seasonal contact networks and model the spread of a highly infectious pathogen. This work provides the first empirical data on the local contact network structure of mobile herds based on quantifiable contact events. The contact network demonstrated high levels of interconnectivity. An increase in contacts near to water resources in the dry season resulted in networks with both higher contact rates and higher potential for pathogen spread than in the wet season. Simulated disease outbreaks were also larger in the dry season. Results support the hypothesis that limited water resources enhance connectivity and transmission within contact networks, as opposed to reducing connectivity as a result of competitive avoidance. These results cast light on the impact of seasonal heterogeneity in resource availability on predicting pathogen transmission dynamics, which has implications for other free-ranging wild and domestic populations.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445', 'afid': '60029445', 'affilname': 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities', 'affiliation-city': 'Minneapolis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['VanderWaal K.', 'Gilbertson M.', 'Okanga S.', 'Allan B.F.', 'Craft M.E.']","['57203151844', '57191960707', '14325406700', '7102506146', '24461312300']",Animal movement | Ecology | Infectious disease | Network analysis | Pathogen,NSF,DEB-1413925,National Science Foundation,,1313822

East Africa is a global hot spot for the diversity of ixodid ticks. As ectoparasites and as vectors of pathogens, ticks negatively affect the well-being of humans, livestock and wildlife. To prevent tick infestations, livestock owners and managers typically treat livestock with acaricides that kill ticks when they attempt to feed on livestock hosts. Because of the costs of preventing and mitigating tick parasitism, predicting where and when ticks will be abundant is an important challenge in this region. We used a 7-year monthly record of tick abundance on large experimental plots to assess the effects of rainfall, wildlife and cattle on larvae, nymphs and adults of two common tick species, Rhipicephalus pulchellus and Rhipicephalus praetextatus. Nymphal and adult ticks were more abundant when there had been high cumulative rainfall in the prior months. They were less abundant when cattle were present than when only large wild mammals were. Larval abundance was not affected by the presence of cattle, and larvae did not appear to be sensitive to rainfall in prior months, though they were less abundant in our surveys when rainfall was high in the sampling month. The challenges of managing ticks in this region are being exacerbated rapidly by changes in rainfall patterns wrought by climate change, and by overall increases in livestock, making efforts to predict the impacts of these drivers all the more pressing.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439', 'afid': '60014439', 'affilname': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliation-city': 'Davis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010828', 'afid': '60010828', 'affilname': 'Bard College', 'affiliation-city': 'Red Hook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Keesing F.', 'Ostfeld R.', 'Young T.', 'Allan B.']","['6701906870', '7006957295', '55755053200', '7102506146']",climate | ectoparasite | Kenya | livestock | Rhipicephalus | tick,,undefined,,,1313822

Future climate forcing data at the temporal and spatial scales needed to drive hydrologic models are not readily available. Simple methods to derive these data from historical data or General Circulation Model (GCM) results may not adequately capture future hydrological variability. This study assessed streamflow response to daily future climate forcing data produced by a new method using subsets of multi-model GCM ensembles for the mid-21st century period in northeast Kansas. Daily timeseries of precipitation and temperature were developed for six future climate scenarios: stationary, uniform 10% changes in precipitation; shifts based on a 15-GCM ensemble-mean; and shifts based on three seasonally-consistent subsets of GCMs representing Spring-Summer combinations that were wetter or drier than the historical period. The analysis of daily streamflow and hydrologic index statistics were conducted. Stationary 10% precipitation shifts generally bounded the monthly mean streamflow projections of the other scenarios, and the 15-GCM ensemble-mean captured non-stationary effects of annual and seasonal hydrological response, but did not identify important intra-annual shifts in drought and flood characteristics. The seasonally-consistent subset ensembles produced a range of distinct monthly streamflow trends, particularly for extreme low-flow and high-flow events. Meaningful water management and planning for the future will require hydrological impact simulations that reflect the range of possible future climates. Use of GCM ensemble-mean climate forcing data without consideration of the range of seasonal patterns among models was demonstrated to remove important seasonal hydrologic patterns that were retained in the subset ensemble-mean approach.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sheshukov A.', 'Douglas-Mankin K.']","['55880756300', '25936043700']",Climate change | General circulation models | Hydrology | IHA | SWAT | Weather generator,USDA,1313815,U.S. Department of Agriculture,,1313815

Climate change in many agricultural contexts will increase tensions between farming and non-farming populations over adaptations in land use and water conservation strategies. How adequately these future tensions may be mitigated will be partially determined by each groups' beliefs about climate change. A voluminous literature shows that climate change beliefs are crucial for understanding engagement with climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and that values motivate climate change beliefs, but the role of values remains unclear, and comparisons of farming and non-farming populations are scant. We develop a model of climate change beliefs that integrates four main motivating factors - values, political ideology, knowledge, and worldview - and we explicitly compare members of farming and non-farming populations in an agricultural watershed in the Central Great Plains, USA. Our findings highlight the role of held values in motivating climate change beliefs and point to areas of potential consensus and tension within and among members of these two groups.

Precipitation and temperature are two primary drivers that significantly affect hydrologic processes in a watershed. A network of land-based National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) weather stations has been typically used as a primary source of climate input for agro-ecosystem models. However, the network may lack the density to adequately capture spatial climate variability throughout large watersheds. High-resolution weather datasets based on 4 km × 4 km grid, such as Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) and Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), have become increasingly available as alternatives to conventional land-based networks. The goal of this study was to evaluate impacts of the three weather datasets, NCDC, NEXRAD, and PRISM, on hydrologic processes in an agricultural catchment in Kansas. A method of collecting and processing three sets of weather input datasets was developed and applied to a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the Smoky Hill River watershed (SHRW) in west-central Kansas, which is sparsely covered by NCDC weather stations with fair to poor range of NEXRAD coverage. SHRW is a typical agricultural catchment in the Central Great Plains; research findings here may be applicable to large areas of the US with similar topography and climate conditions. The SWAT model based on PRISM dataset was able to capture daily streamflow alterations with a greater accuracy compared to NCDC and NEXRAD based SWAT models. With three different weather inputs, SWAT with NCDC consistently overestimated monthly stream discharges, while the SWAT models based on NEXRAD and PRISM datasets tended to underestimate monthly high flows of over 8 m3 s− 1 and overestimate monthly low flows of below 1 m3 s− 1. In general, all models overestimated streamflow in dry years and underestimated streamflow in wet years, however, the PRISM-based model generated smaller bias than the models utilizing NEXRAD or NCDC. The use of PRISM resulted in better statistical performance metrics for streamflow. The conducted study suggests that gridded weather datasets can significantly improve simulated streamflow at daily, monthly and yearly scales as compared to traditional land-based networks.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025837', 'afid': '60025837', 'affilname': 'Blackland Research and Extension Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Temple', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001989', 'afid': '60001989', 'affilname': 'USDA Agricultural Research Service, Washington DC', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gao J.', 'Sheshukov A.', 'Yen H.', 'White M.']","['55622974600', '55880756300', '56024649400', '57212699300']",Climate data | Kansas | NCDC | NEXRAD | PRISM | SWAT,NSF,1313815,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0341816217301327,1313815

This study assessed the shifts, variability, and uncertainty in streamflow simulation from three downscaling data sources (NCDC land-based weather stations, NEXRAD spatial grid, and PRISM spatial grid) relative to those introduced by six GCMs and three RCPs in west-central Kansas, U.S. Streamflow simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model was found to be more sensitive to future precipitation than to maximum and minimum temperatures. The greatest uncertainty in simulated streamflow was associated with selection of the GCM.

The study uses survey data and multinomial Logit models to predict land-use choices. Two models were tested. The first model does not incorporate variables concerning farmer perceptions and attitudes about land-use choices, while the second model does. The results show that CRP re-enrollment depends on factors, such as years of experience in cropping and percent of cropland irrigated.

Crop rotation is a commonly used management practice in the central U.S. whereby different agricultural crops are grown on a farm field in successive years to help maintain the productive capacity of the soil. Understanding hydrologic responses to crop rotation is critical for developing appropriate crop rotation strategies for sustainable water resources management. These responses are not well understood due to limited availability of multi-year, crop-specific land use-land cover data. The study focuses on the Smoky Hill River watershed in west-central Kansas, a typical agro-ecosystem watershed in the Central Great Plains of the U.S. A multi-year land use dataset developed for the state of Kansas was used to identify 3-year crop rotation patterns in the watershed for three different periods (2006–08, 2008–10, 2010–12). Out of 276 unique rotations, 21 rotations were found to be dominant, with rotation patterns of grain sorghum-fallow-winter wheat (G-F-W), winter wheat-winter wheat-fallow (W-W-F), and continuous winter wheat (W-W-W) occupying more than 81% of the cropland in each rotation period. From 2006 to 2012, the coverage of grain sorghum increased by 26% and corn by 305%, while winter wheat decreased by 20%. Three 11-year simulation scenarios based on three 3-year crop rotation patterns were implemented in the SWAT model and separately calibrated for streamflow at two gauge sites. The SWAT model produced good calibration statistics for the periods corresponding to the applied crop rotations, while the statistics tended to decrease for other periods, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient becoming unsatisfactory for periods of six to eight years outside of the calibration period. Applying a different number of dominant crop rotations to the SWAT model, it was found that the number can be reduced down to the five most dominant without significant loss in model performance. While the optimum number of crop rotations must be evaluated for each agricultural watershed, this finding provides valuable information for watershed model development and calibration, which can help to avoid issues of over-parameterization and equifinality.",10,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025837', 'afid': '60025837', 'affilname': 'Blackland Research and Extension Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Temple', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015457', 'afid': '60015457', 'affilname': 'University of Kansas, Lawrence', 'affiliation-city': 'Lawrence', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gao J.', 'Sheshukov A.', 'Yen H.', 'Kastens J.', 'Peterson D.']","['55622974600', '55880756300', '56024649400', '6602445565', '7402793322']",Crop rotations | Land use representability | Model performance | SWAT | Watershed modeling,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167880917302621,1313815

Brazil, in its intended nationally determined contribution protocol on the Paris Agreement, set to enhancement the usage of energy from sugarcane. To sustainably meet this goal, the Brazilian government rely on the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning (SAZ). The SAZ, based on soil, climate, and land use conditions, defines as suitable 63 million hectares (Mha). Such an area would suffice the future demand for sugarcane. However, climate change impacts on the climate conditions necessary to grow sugarcane may promote a mismatch between the SAZ and future suitability. Our goal is to examine the effects of climate change on the SAZ policy. We developed ecological niche models to identify the suitability criteria and generate scenarios under 17 global climate models listed in the IPCC 5 for 2050. An ensemble of the 17 scenarios identifies areas of estimation congruence thus indicating smaller uncertainty regarding the suitability of these areas. Areas of high congruence (above 70% of prediction) encompass 1.53 Mha by 2050, a reduction of 97.5% compared to SAZ. Including areas of high congruence outside of the SAZ increases the suitable area to 7 Mha. The public and private sector in Brazil needs to develop large-scale adaptation strategies such as improving the research cycle of sugarcane varieties and reducing yield gaps by advancing the management of sugarcane fields to propel Brazil into fulfilling its Paris Agreement commitment.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027136', 'afid': '60027136', 'affilname': 'Universidade Federal de Goias', 'affiliation-city': 'Goiania', 'affiliation-country': 'Brazil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Granco G.', 'Caldas M.', 'De Marco P.']","['56801068700', '7005308033', '7006718539']",Biofuels | Climate change policy | Ecological niche model | Land use policy | Sustainability | Zoning,NSF,1313815,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0921344919300400,1313815

This integrated analytical framework helps diagnose vulnerability to climate change, whilst identifying and comparing adaptation options that could reduce vulnerability, following four broad steps: i) determine likely level of exposure to climate change, and how climate change might interact with existing stresses and other future drivers of change; ii) determine the sensitivity of stocks of capital assets and flows of ecosystem services to climate change; iii) identify factors influencing decisions to develop and/or adopt different adaptation strategies, based on innovation or the use/substitution of existing assets; and iv) identify and evaluate potential trade-offs between adaptation options.

The micro-model was used to simulate macro-level diffusion patterns emerging from different configurations of micro-model parameters. Micro-level simulation results matched very closely the adoption patterns predicted by the widely-used Bass macro-level model (Bass, 1969 [1]). For a portion of the p-q domain, results from micro-simulations were consistent with aggregate-level adoption patterns reported in the literature. Induced Bass macro-level parameters p and q responded to changes in micro-parameters: (1) p increased with the number of innovators and with the rate at which innovators are introduced; (2) q increased with the probability of rewiring in small-world networks, as the characteristic path length decreases; and (3) an increase in the overall perceived utility of an innovation caused a corresponding increase in induced p and q values.

These effects gain special relevance in the mountain ranges of dry regions, which play a key role in water provision. This is the case of the eastern front of the Córdoba hills, where ~35.000 ha of pine plantations have replaced natural grasslands. We explored how this transformation has affected water yield in small watersheds. For this purpose we selected four pairs of neighboring watersheds occupied by natural grasslands and Pinus ellioti plantations (area: 27 to 143 ha; elevation: 1100 to 1750 m.a.s.l.). For all pairs, basal streamflow was measured through the tracer dilution method with seasonal frequency between May 2004 and January 2007, and in two of these pairs we performed a continuous monitoring using automatic level sensors during the transition between the dry and humid season of 2006-2007. On average, water yield in afforested watersheds was 48% less than in grassland watersheds (112 vs. 204 mm/year or 24 vs. 13% of precipitation inputs during the study period, P<0.05). Continuous measurements revealed higher base flows and little response to vegetation in high elevation and slope watersheds, and lower and more vegetation-sensitive base fows in low elevation and intermediate slope watersheds. The remote sensing characterization of watersheds based on a green index (NDVI) from MODIS suggested higher and more stable primary productivity and evapotranspiration under plantations compared to grasslands, with maximum contrasts taking place in winter. Currently the impact of plantations in the hills on water provision can be intense only at the level of primary watersheds, since those of larger order are only partially afforested. At the regional level is important to contemplate these effects to project how much, where and how will be planted, particularly in areas that supply water to the largest foci of hydroenergy and urban demand.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025269', 'afid': '60025269', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de Entre Rios', 'affiliation-city': 'Concepcion del Uruguay', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002218', 'afid': '60002218', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de San Luis', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['Jobbágy E.', 'Acosta A.', 'Nosetto M.']","['6701852277', '55820783900', '9243877400']",Afforestation | Ecosystem services | Water balance | Water cycle,,undefined,,,1211613

Depending on its depth from the soil surface, shallow groundwater can represent a valuable water resource to alleviate droughts, or a stress agent that causes waterlogging and flooding in rainfed crops. Groundwater depth varies across space, following landscape topographic features; through time, accompanying climate fluctuations; and may also shift in both dimensions in response to crop choice. We evaluated the contribution of climate, topography and crop choice on the variability of groundwater depth in rainfed systems of western Pampas, throughout a five year period of extreme precipitation fluctuation (2008-2013). Sixteen permanent monitoring wells were installed in four different topographic settings along the smoothly rolling landscape, covering the three phases of a maize-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation, common in the region. Water table dynamics, measured at weekly to monthly intervals, was very similar across landscape positions, with a range of depth from the surface of -0.2 (flood) to 1.8m and 1.8-4.4m in the lowest and highest positions, respectively. At the inter-annual scale, water table fluctuations were predominantly dictated by climate variability with no effect due to the implanted crop. Only at the intra-annual scale, crop choice appeared as a relevant control, with wheat-soybean flattening the spring level rises and summer drops repeatedly found under maize and soybean single crops. Daily meteorological data and remote sensing estimates of live and dead crop cover were used to simulate transpiration demand and soil evaporation. As the balance between precipitation and crop evapotranspiration was positive/negative, watertables raised/dropped 0.21cmmm-1 (n=80, R2 0.32) and 0.22cmmm-1 (n=1092, R2 0.31) at inter and intra-annual scales, respectively. While crop choice may influence water table levels within a growing season, it has only a subtle effect on year to year fluctuation. With the explored annual crop options, farmers in the Pampas could reduce spring flooding risk when sowing double crops but cannot have a substantial effect on the longer term dynamics of the water table.",23,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002218', 'afid': '60002218', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de San Luis', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563', 'afid': '60001563', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115753348', 'afid': '115753348', 'affilname': 'INTA (National Institute of Agricultural Technology) San Luis', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['Mercau J.', 'Nosetto M.', 'Bert F.', 'Giménez R.', 'Jobbágy E.']","['6508108850', '9243877400', '12753730800', '55377300900', '6701852277']",Annual crops | Argentina | Ecohydrology | Farming | Water table depth,IAI,CRN-2031,International Association for Identification,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378377415301050,1211613

In flat plains groundwater affects agricultural production outcomes and risks. Agricultural land use decisions, however, may strongly impact groundwater levels available for production. This paper explores the scope for managing groundwater levels through land use decisions in a sub-basin of the Salado River in the Argentine Pampas, a very flat area that plays a key role in world agricultural production. A spatially distributed hydrological model implemented with MIKE SHE software was used to establish the impacts of different land uses on groundwater dynamics, and to assess the interdependencies among spatially close decision-makers sharing a water table (WT). Additionally, groundwater level changes in response to climate variability were quantified. We found land use has strong effects on WT levels both for oneself (e.g. pastures can lead to significant decreases (up to 4.5 m) in WT levels) and others, in the form of strong interdependencies that exist between farmers sharing a WT where land use decisions of one farmer effect groundwater level of neighbouring farms and vice versa. However, the effectiveness to control groundwater levels through land use decisions is subject to the rather unpredictable effects of rainfall variability. The results presented in this paper provide key insights in relation to physical and social aspects that should be considered for managing groundwater levels through land use decisions, in order to avoid negative and/or maximize positive effects on agricultural production.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092272', 'afid': '60092272', 'affilname': 'Instituto Nacional del Agua, Argentina', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017789', 'afid': '60017789', 'affilname': 'Manhattan College', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011484', 'afid': '60011484', 'affilname': 'Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002218', 'afid': '60002218', 'affilname': 'Universidad Nacional de San Luis', 'affiliation-city': 'San Luis', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563', 'afid': '60001563', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['García P.', 'Menénendez A.', 'Podestá G.', 'Bert F.', 'Arora P.', 'Jobbágy E.']","['35775145800', '57196075091', '7004150925', '12753730800', '55192627000', '6701852277']",Argentine pampas | climate variability | groundwater dynamics | hydrological modelling | interdependencies | Land use change,IAI,0709681,International Association for Identification,,1211613

We include domain-averaged (e.g., areal) seasonal total precipitation and mean maximum and minimum temperatures as covariates for conditional simulation. Areal covariates are motivated by a principal component analysis that indicates the seasonal spatial average is the dominant mode of variability across the domain.

Farm production often involves family-owned agribusinesses where decisions are made by households or individuals, not corporate managers. As these decisions have important economic, environmental, and social implications, decision-making processes must be understood to foster sustainable agricultural production. Decision experiments, involving lotteries, targeting farmers in the Argentine Pampas were used to estimate prospect theory (PT) parameters. Results suggest that decisions under risk are better represented by prospect theory than by expected utility (EU) theory: Decision makers treat gains and losses differently and use subjective probabilities of outcomes; they are quite loss averse and are more likely to overweigh probabilities of infrequent events, such as large droughts or floods. Statistical testing revealed heterogeneity in the risk tied to land tenure (land owners vs. renters) and agribusiness roles (farmers vs. technical advisors). Perceptions of risk, probability, and outcomes played a large role in the sustainability of production. Due to a strong desire to avoid losses, decision makers have a greater short term focus: Immediate economic outcomes are more salient, and environmental and social investments are framed as costs rather than long-term gains. This research can help design policies, programs, and tools that assist agribusinesses in managing better contradictions across the triple bottom line to ensure greater sustainability.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017789', 'afid': '60017789', 'affilname': 'Manhattan College', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011484', 'afid': '60011484', 'affilname': 'Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gonzalez-Ramirez J.', 'Arora P.', 'Podesta G.']","['55576350400', '55192627000', '7004150925']",Agribusiness decision making | Land tenure | Prospect theory | Risk preferences | Sustainable agriculture,NSF,CNH-1211613,Columbia University,,1211613

We present guidelines for doing so, and provide an example in the context of the Pampas Model (PM), an ABM aimed to explore the dynamics of structural and land use changes in the agricultural systems of the Argentine Pampas. Many complementary strategies are proposed for validation of ABM's. We adopted a validation framework that relies on two main streams: (a) validation of model processes and components during model development, which involved a literature survey, design based on similar models, involvement of stakeholders, and focused test scenarios and (b) empirical validation, which involved comparisons of model outputs from multiple realistic simulations against real world data. The design process ensured a realistic model ontology and representative behavioral rules. As result, we obtained reasonable outcomes from a set of initial and simplified scenarios: the PM successfully reproduced the direction of the primary observed structural and land tenure patterns, even before calibration. The empirical validation process lead to tuning and further development of the PM. After this, the PM was able to reproduce not only the direction but also the magnitude of the observed changes.

Land exchange through rental transactions is a central process in agricultural systems. The land tenure regimes emerge from land transactions and structural and land use changes are tied to the dynamics of the land market. We introduce LARMA, a LAnd Rental MArket model embedded within the Pampas Model (PM), an agent-based model of Argentinean agricultural systems. LARMA produces endogenous formation of land rental prices. LARMA relies on traditional economic concepts for LRP formation but addresses some drawbacks of this approach by being integrated into an agent-based model that considers heterogeneous agents interacting with one another. PM-LARMA successfully reproduced the agricultural land tenure regimes and land rental prices observed in the Pampas. Including adaptive, heterogeneous and interacting agents was critical to this success. We conclude that agent-based and traditional economic models can be successfully combined to capture complex emergent land tenure and market price patterns while simplifying the overall model design.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028609', 'afid': '60028609', 'affilname': 'Argonne National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Lemont', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011484', 'afid': '60011484', 'affilname': 'Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Miami', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563', 'afid': '60001563', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bert F.', 'North M.', 'Rovere S.', 'Tatara E.', 'Macal C.', 'Podestá G.']","['12753730800', '35345782800', '36925964700', '6603258407', '6602115360', '7004150925']",Agent-based modeling | Agricultural land markets | Agricultural production | Argentina | Land tenure,IAI,W-31-109-Eng-38,University of Chicago,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1364815215001528,1211613

The psychological influence of ownership, albeit well studied in the lab, is less understood in the field. We examine its influence on agribusiness goals and decisions in the Argentine Pampas. Study 1, a survey of agribusinesses, finds differences in goal focus based on land ownership: Ownership positively predicts a focus on longer-term economic and social goals, as well as pro-environmental attitudes. Land ownership negatively predicts short-term profitability goal focus, which in turn mediates the use of futures/options to maximize profit, and influences land use for cash crops. Study 2 unpacks within-business differences via interviews with agribusiness that farm both owned and rented land. Ownership-based differences are observed in underlying intentions: the same individual focuses on enhancing the value of owned land, but on maximizing returns from rented land. This focus on deriving immediate value may be motivated by the initial rental cost incurred by the tenant, which can be thought of as a loss, making immediate profitability a more salient goal. This short-term focus, though logical in light of prevailing one-year leases in the Pampas, ignores that over 85% of leases are renewed by the same agribusiness, suggesting that the same tenant may well be the person facing future consequences. We explore the possibility that tenants may be effectively caught in a two-person social dilemma with their future selves.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030162', 'afid': '60030162', 'affilname': 'Columbia University in the City of New York', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029251', 'afid': '60029251', 'affilname': 'University of Miami', 'affiliation-city': 'Coral Gables', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017789', 'afid': '60017789', 'affilname': 'Manhattan College', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563', 'afid': '60001563', 'affilname': 'Universidad de Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-city': 'Buenos Aires', 'affiliation-country': 'Argentina'}]",Journal,Article,"['Arora P.', 'Bert F.', 'Podesta G.', 'Krantz D.']","['55192627000', '12753730800', '7004150925', '8895850200']",Argentina | Decision-making | Environmental attitudes | Goals | Land use decisions | Ownership effect | Social dilemma,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2214804315000257,1211613

We test the ability of three different partitioning configurations within the model to reproduce observed total concentrations in the midlatitudes and the Arctic as well as midlatitude gas-particle phase distributions. The configurations tested are (1) the GEOS-Chem default configuration, which uses instantaneous equilibrium partitioning to divide PAHs among the gas phase, a primary organic matter (OM) phase (absorptive), and a black carbon (BC) phase (adsorptive), (2) an SOA configuration in which PAHs are trapped in SOA when emitted and slowly evaporate from SOA thereafter, and (3) a configuration in which PAHs are trapped in primary OM/BC upon emission and subsequently slowly evaporate. We also test the influence of changing the fraction of PAHs available for particle-phase oxidation. Trapping PAHs in SOA particles upon formation and protecting against particle-phase oxidation (2) better simulates observed remote concentrations compared to our default configuration (1). However, simulating adsorptive partitioning to BC is required to reproduce the magnitude and seasonal pattern of gas-particle phase distributions. Thus, the last configuration (3) results in the best agreement between observed and simulated concentration/phase distribution data.

We use the GEOS-Chem model coupled to meteorology from a general circulation model and focus on impacts to northern hemisphere midlatitudes and the Arctic. We project declines in anthropogenic emissions (up to 20%) and concentrations (up to 37%), with particle-bound PAHs declining more, and greater declines in midlatitudes versus the Arctic. Climate change causes relatively minor increases in midlatitude concentrations for the more volatile PHE and PYR (up to 4%) and decreases (3%) for particle-bound BaP. In the Arctic, all PAHs decline slightly under future climate (up to 2%). Overall, we observe a small 2050 ""climate penalty"" for volatile PAHs and ""climate benefit"" for particle-bound PAHs. The degree of penalty or benefit depends on competition between deposition and surface-to-air fluxes of previously deposited PAHs. Particles and temperature have greater impacts on future transport than oxidants, with particle changes alone accounting for 15% of BaP decline under 2050 emissions. Higher temperatures drive increasing surface-to-air fluxes that cause PHE and PYR climate penalties.

We developed a novel system to continuously measure Hg 0g concentrations in soil pores at multiple depths and locations, and present a total of 297 days of measurements spanning 14 months in two forests in the Sierra Nevada mountains, California, U.S. Temporal patterns showed consistent pore Hg0g concentrations below levels measured in the atmosphere (termed Hg0g immobilization), ranging from 66 to 94% below atmospheric concentrations throughout multiple seasons. The lowest pore Hg0g concentrations were observed in the deepest soil layers (40 cm), but significant immobilization was already present in the top 7 cm. In the absence of sinks or sources, pore Hg 0g levels would be in equilibrium with atmospheric concentrations due to the porous nature of the soil matrix and gas diffusion. Therefore, we explain decreases in pore Hg0g in mineral soils below atmospheric concentrations - or below levels found in upper soils as observed in previous studies - with the presence of an Hg0g sink in mineral soils possibly related to Hg0g oxidation or other processes such as sorption or dissolution in soil water. Surface chamber measurements showing daytime Hg0g emissions and nighttime Hg0g deposition indicate that near-surface layers likely dominate net atmospheric Hg 0g exchange resulting in typical diurnal cycles due to photochemcial reduction at the surface and possibly Hg0g evasion from litter layers. In contrast, mineral soils seem to be decoupled from this surface exchange, showing consistent Hg0g uptake and downward redistribution - although our calculations indicate these fluxes to be minor compared to other mass fluxes.

This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are $339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from $1.4 billion to $575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are $104 billion, with a range from $6 million to $171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈1.4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations.

Using sensitivity simulations to assess processes within, outside, or transport to the Arctic, we examine the influence of climate-and emissions-driven processes on Arctic concentrations and their effect on improving the simulated Arctic seasonal cycle. We find evidence that processes occurring outside the Arctic have a greater influence on Arctic atmospheric PCB levels than processes that occur within the Arctic. Our simulations suggest that re-emissions from sea ice melting or from the Arctic Ocean during summer would have to be unrealistically high in order to capture observed temporal trends of PCBs in the Arctic atmosphere. We conclude that midlatitude processes are likely to have a greater effect on the Arctic under global change scenarios than re-emissions within the Arctic.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195', 'afid': '60022195', 'affilname': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018269', 'afid': '60018269', 'affilname': 'Maine Maritime Academy', 'affiliation-city': 'Castine', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Friedman C.', 'Selin N.']","['13005920500', '15081312600']",,,undefined,,,1313755

To examine issues of mercury contamination in lake sediments and fish, we require insight into historic sources of mercury and details of watershed methyl mercury (MeHg) cycling. Modern-day National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) estimates of atmospheric mercury deposition in the upper Midwest region range from 4-10 μg/m2/y (wet only) to 5-30 μg/m2/y (gross deposition). Sedimentary records from scattered Michigan lakes, removed from mining sites, record around 5-24 μg/m2/y modern THg deposition. However, these values are not representative of historic deposition near mining sites. On the Keweenaw Peninsula, mercury occurs naturally in copper ores and was discharged by smelting and stamp mill (tailings) operations. Here we examine mercury fluxes into two lakes (Portage and Torch Lake, portions of the Keweenaw Waterway) off Lake Superior, part of the previous Torch Lake Superfund site. Total mercury fluxes document greatly enhanced mercury loading (mean ca. 1590 μg/m2/y; peaks of 5120 to 21,300 μg/m2/y) during the height of copper mining (1880-1930), followed by a rapid decline once activities ceased. Methylmercury profiles appear to document both current methylation and historic methylation during mining operations. Time differences in MeHg and THg profiles may relate to watershed delivery time lags, toxic effects of copper on methylating bacteria, or to stratigraphic mobility. Whereas rapid sedimentation and lowered copper flux are promoting ecosystem recovery in Portage Lake, slower burial by organic-rich sediments is enhancing metal concentrations in Torch Lake sediments.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016536', 'afid': '60016536', 'affilname': 'Michigan Technological University', 'affiliation-city': 'Houghton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Charles Kerfoot W.', 'Urban N.', 'McDonald C.', 'Rossmann R.', 'Zhang H.']","['35363442700', '7006930786', '35221899600', '6701832525', '57113837900']",Copper mining | Keweenaw Peninsula | Lake Superior | Mercury flux | Methylmercury | Sediment cores,EPA,OCE 97-12872,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0380133015002051,1313755

A synthesis of published vegetation mercury (Hg) data across 11 contiguous states in the western United States showed that aboveground biomass concentrations followed the order: leaves (26 μg kg− 1) ~ branches (26 μg kg− 1) > bark (16 μg kg− 1) > bole wood (1 μg kg− 1). No spatial trends of Hg in aboveground biomass distribution were detected, which likely is due to very sparse data coverage and different sampling protocols. Vegetation data are largely lacking for important functional vegetation types such as shrubs, herbaceous species, and grasses. Soil concentrations collected from the published literature were high in the western United States, with 12% of observations exceeding 100 μg kg− 1, reflecting a bias toward investigations in Hg-enriched sites. In contrast, soil Hg concentrations from a randomly distributed data set (1911 sampling points; Smith et al., 2013a) averaged 24 μg kg− 1 (A-horizon) and 22 μg kg− 1 (C-horizon), and only 2.6% of data exceeded 100 μg kg− 1. Soil Hg concentrations significantly differed among land covers, following the order: forested upland > planted/cultivated > herbaceous upland/shrubland > barren soils. Concentrations in forests were on average 2.5 times higher than in barren locations. Principal component analyses showed that soil Hg concentrations were not or weakly related to modeled dry and wet Hg deposition and proximity to mining, geothermal areas, and coal-fired power plants. Soil Hg distribution also was not closely related to other trace metals, but strongly associated with organic carbon, precipitation, canopy greenness, and foliar Hg pools of overlying vegetation. These patterns indicate that soil Hg concentrations are related to atmospheric deposition and reflect an overwhelming influence of plant productivity — driven by water availability — with productive landscapes showing high soil Hg accumulation and unproductive barren soils and shrublands showing low soil Hg values. Large expanses of low-productivity, arid ecosystems across the western U.S. result in some of the lowest soil Hg concentrations observed worldwide.",24,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024937', 'afid': '60024937', 'affilname': 'Desert Research Institute Reno, Division of Atmospheric Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Reno', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023439', 'afid': '60023439', 'affilname': 'Desert Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Reno', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011442', 'afid': '60011442', 'affilname': 'Lamar University', 'affiliation-city': 'Beaumont', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Obrist D.', 'Pearson C.', 'Webster J.', 'Kane T.', 'Lin C.J.', 'Aiken G.R.', 'Alpers C.N.']","['6602656548', '56708100800', '55174582200', '57040710100', '57200014526', '57207563153', '7103178564']",Landscape gradients | Plant pump | Soil pollution | Trace metals | Western North American mercury synthesis | Wnams,PLR,1304202,Division of Polar Programs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0048969715310858,1313755

This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are $339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from $1.4 billion to $575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are $104 billion, with a range from $6 million to $171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈1.4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations. Per megagram of prevented emissions, our domestic policy scenario results in US benefits about an order of magnitude higher than from our global scenario, further highlighting the importance of domestic action.",34,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195', 'afid': '60022195', 'affilname': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Giang A.', 'Selin N.']","['36466297100', '15081312600']",Economic benefits | Impacts assessment | Mercury | Minamata Convention | Policy,NSF,1053648,National Science Foundation,,1313755

Mercury is an important pollutant that can be transported globally due to its long lifetime in the atmosphere. Atmosphere-surface exchange is a major process affecting the cycling of mercury in the global environment and its impacts on food webs. We investigate the sensitivities of the air-surface exchange, atmospheric transport, and budget of mercury to projected 2000-2050 changes in climate and land use/land cover with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). We find that annual mean Hg(0) dry deposition flux over land could increase by up to 20% in northern mid-latitudes by 2050 due to increased vegetation and foliage density. Climate change can significantly affect both the wet deposition and atmospheric chemistry of mercury. In response to the projected climate change, the annual mean wet deposition flux increases over most continental regions and decreases over most of the mid-latitude and tropical oceans. The annual mean mercury wet deposition flux over northern and southern high latitudes increases by 7% and 8% respectively, largely driven by increases in precipitation there. Surface Hg(0) is predicted to increase generally, because high temperatures decrease Hg(0) oxidation by bromine and high moisture increases aqueous Hg(II) photo reduction.

Over the last half century, a multijurisdictional, multiscale system of governance has emerged to address concerns associated with toxic chemicals that have the capacity to bioaccumulate in organisms and biomagnify in food chains, leading to fish consumption advisories. Components of this system of governance include international conventions (such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Minamata Convention on Mercury), laws enacted by nation states and their subjurisdictions, and efforts to adaptively manage regional ecosystems (such as the U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes). Given that many of these compounds - including mercury, industrial chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides such as toxaphene - circulate throughout the globe through cycles of deposition and reemission, regional efforts to eliminate the need for fish consumption advisories cannot be successful without efforts to reduce emissions everywhere in the world. This paper argues that the scientific community, by monitoring the concentrations of these compounds in the atmosphere and by modeling their fate and transport, play an important role in connecting the various jurisdictional scales of governance. In addition, the monitoring networks that this community of scientists has established can be visualized as a technology of governance essential in an era in which societies have the capacity to produce and release such chemicals on an industrial scale.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016536', 'afid': '60016536', 'affilname': 'Michigan Technological University', 'affiliation-city': 'Houghton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101106107', 'afid': '101106107', 'affilname': 'Northwest Indian College', 'affiliation-city': 'Tacoma', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Gorman H.', 'Gagnon V.', 'Norman E.']","['6701344423', '57193496181', '36852054600']",Chemical governance | Fish consumption advisories | Regulatory science | Toxic chemical,NSF,ICER-1313755,National Science Foundation,,1313755

A geographic enigma is that present-day atmospheric deposition of mercury in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is low (48%) and that regional industrial emissions have declined substantially (ca. 81% reduction) relative to downstate. Mercury levels should be declining. However, state (MDEQ) surveys of rivers and lakes revealed elevated total mercury (THg) in Upper Peninsula waters and sediment relative to downstate. Moreover, Western Upper Peninsula (WUP) fish possess higher methyl mercury (MeHg) levels than Northern Lower Peninsula (NLP) fish. A contributing explanation for elevated THg loading is that a century ago the Upper Peninsula was a major industrial region, centered on mining. Many regional ores (silver, copper, zinc, massive sulfides) contain mercury in part per million concentrations. Copper smelters and iron furnace-taconite operations broadcast mercury almost continuously for 140 years, whereas mills discharged tailings and old mine shafts leaked contaminated water. We show that mercury emissions from copper and iron operations were substantial (60-650 kg per year) and dispersed over relatively large areas. Moreover, lake sediments in the vicinity of mining operations have higher THg concentrations. Sediment profiles from the Keweenaw Waterway show that THg accumulation increased 50- to 400-fold above modern-day atmospheric deposition levels during active mining and smelting operations, with lingering MeHg effects. High MeHg concentrations are geographically correlated with low pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a consequence of biogeochemical cycling in wetlands, characteristic of the Upper Peninsula. DOC can mobilize metals and elevate MeHg concentrations. We argue that mercury loading from mining is historically superimposed upon strong regional wetland effects, producing a combined elevation of both THg and MeHg in the Western Upper Peninsula.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021439', 'afid': '60021439', 'affilname': 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016536', 'afid': '60016536', 'affilname': 'Michigan Technological University', 'affiliation-city': 'Houghton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kerfoot W.', 'Urban N.', 'McDonald C.', 'Zhang H.', 'Rossmann R.', 'Perlinger J.', 'Khan T.', 'Hendricks A.', 'Priyadarshini M.', 'Bolstad M.']","['7003367713', '7006930786', '35221899600', '57113837900', '6701832525', '6602131818', '57196244170', '57200407250', '57201729673', '57201724382']",,NSF,ICER-1313755,Norsk Sykepleierforbund,,1313755

Despite considerable effort to develop mechanistic dry particle deposition parameterizations for atmospheric transport models, current knowledge has been inadequate to propose quantitative measures of the relative performance of available parameterizations. In this study, we evaluated the performance of five dry particle deposition parameterizations developed by Zhang et al. (2001) (""Z01""), Petroff and Zhang (2010) (""PZ10""), Kouznetsov and Sofiev (2012) (""KS12""), Zhang and He (2014) (""ZH14""), and Zhang and Shao (2014) (""ZS14""), respectively. The evaluation was performed in three dimensions: model ability to reproduce observed deposition velocities, Vd (accuracy); the influence of imprecision in input parameter values on the modeled Vd (uncertainty); and identification of the most influential parameter( s) (sensitivity). The accuracy of the modeled Vd was evaluated using observations obtained from five land use categories (LUCs): grass, coniferous and deciduous forests, natural water, and ice/snow. To ascertain the uncertainty in modeled Vd, and quantify the influence of imprecision in key model input parameters, a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was performed. The Sobol' sensitivity analysis was conducted with the objective to determine the parameter ranking from the most to the least influential. Comparing the normalized mean bias factors (indicators of accuracy), we find that the ZH14 parameterization is the most accurate for all LUCs except for coniferous forest, for which it is second most accurate. From Monte Carlo simulations, the estimated mean normalized uncertainties in the modeled Vd obtained for seven particle sizes (ranging from 0.005 to 2.5 μm) for the five LUCs are 17, 12, 13, 16, and 27% for the Z01, PZ10, KS12, ZH14, and ZS14 parameterizations, respectively. From the Sobol' sensitivity results, we suggest that the parameter rankings vary by particle size and LUC for a given parameterization. Overall, for dp D0.001 to 1.0 μm, friction velocity was one of the three most influential parameters in all parameterizations. For giant particles (dp D10 μm), relative humidity was the most influential parameter. Because it is the least complex of the five parameterizations, and it has the greatest accuracy and least uncertainty, we propose that the ZH14 parameterization is currently superior for incorporation into atmospheric transport models.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016536', 'afid': '60016536', 'affilname': 'Michigan Technological University', 'affiliation-city': 'Houghton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Khan T.', 'Perlinger J.']","['57196244170', '6602131818']",,,undefined,,,1313755

All rights reserved. Anthropogenic activities have led to large-scale mercury (Hg) pollution in the Arctic. It has been suggested that sea-salt-induced chemical cycling of Hg (through 'atmospheric mercury depletion events', or AMDEs) and wet deposition via precipitation are sources of Hg to the Arctic in its oxidized form (Hg(ii)). However, there is little evidence for the occurrence of AMDEs outside of coastal regions, and their importance to net Hg deposition has been questioned. Furthermore, wet-deposition measurements in the Arctic showed some of the lowest levels of Hg deposition via precipitation worldwide, raising questions as to the sources of high Arctic Hg loading. Here we present a comprehensive Hg-deposition mass-balance study, and show that most of the Hg (about 70%) in the interior Arctic tundra is derived from gaseous elemental Hg (Hg(0)) deposition, with only minor contributions from the deposition of Hg(ii) via precipitation or AMDEs. We find that deposition of Hg(0)-the form ubiquitously present in the global atmosphere-occurs throughout the year, and that it is enhanced in summer through the uptake of Hg(0) by vegetation. Tundra uptake of gaseous Hg(0) leads to high soil Hg concentrations, with Hg masses greatly exceeding the levels found in temperate soils. Our concurrent Hg stable isotope measurements in the atmosphere, snowpack, vegetation and soils support our finding that Hg(0) dominates as a source to the tundra. Hg concentration and stable isotope data from an inland-To-coastal transect show high soil Hg concentrations consistently derived from Hg(0), suggesting that the Arctic tundra might be a globally important Hg sink. We suggest that the high tundra soil Hg concentrations might also explain why Arctic rivers annually transport large amounts of Hg to the Arctic Ocean.",109,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102124', 'afid': '60102124', 'affilname': 'Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées', 'affiliation-city': 'Toulouse', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033461', 'afid': '60033461', 'affilname': 'University of Massachusetts Lowell', 'affiliation-city': 'Lowell', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024937', 'afid': '60024937', 'affilname': 'Desert Research Institute Reno, Division of Atmospheric Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Reno', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007315', 'afid': '60007315', 'affilname': 'Gas Technology Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Des Plaines', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001422', 'afid': '60001422', 'affilname': 'Sorbonne Universite', 'affiliation-city': 'Paris', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Obrist D.', 'Agnan Y.', 'Jiskra M.', 'Olson C.L.', 'Colegrove D.P.', 'Hueber J.', 'Moore C.W.', 'Sonke J.E.', 'Helmig D.']","['6602656548', '39260930900', '42161592700', '57194947631', '57194944554', '12782376100', '55452477000', '6602683836', '7004211803']",,ERC,ERC-2010-StG-20091028,European Research Council,,1313755

In the original article, there were errors in some numerical values in Table 3 and in the text in Sections 3.1 and 4.1. The corrected Table and Sections are shown below. The changes are to the magnitudes of mercury species deposition to the Great Lakes region, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Adirondack region of the Lakes basin. The changes to the Adirondack values reduce the numerical differences in these magnitudes compared to magnitudes of total mercury deposition to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The changes to the mercury species deposition to the Great Lakes region and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have no implications. The changes do not impact the conclusions of the article. 3.1 Atmospheric deposition of Hg to the GL region, Michigan's UP, and New York's Adirondacks region in the present vs. 2050 Changes in total (wet + dry) Hg deposition estimated from GEOS-Chem simulations from the present to the future (2050) are summarized in Table 3, along with % contributions to the policy-in-action scenario from the three policy scales (global, U.S., or Lake Superior). Total deposition is estimated to decrease by 70% due to the aspirational policy change scenario in the GL region (Fig. S1'), while it is estimated to decrease by 65% in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) and 73% in the New York Adirondack region. These large estimated decreases are reasonable given that for the aspirational scenario, all anthropogenic emissions in the 2050 simulation were turned off. Because legacy emissions are held constant, this scenario does not represent pre-industrial emissions. The combined policy-in-action scenario leads to 20%, 15%, and 22% decreases in atmospheric deposition in 2050 in the GL, Michigan's UP, and New York Adirondack regions, respectively (Table 3). Fig. 2 presents the effects of individual scales of policies (Lake Superior, U.S., and global) on the combined policy-in-action deposition bene?t for the GL region. Approximately 85% of the total decrease is due to U.S. Clean Air Act regulations including MATS, while the local (Lake Superior Basin) and global (Minamata Convention) policies each account for 1% and 14% of the total decrease, respectively. Fig. 2B demonstrates the effect of reducing U.S. emissions on GL regional deposition. The 1.5 times greater reduction in deposition in the Adirondacks compared to the UP for this scenario is therefore largely related to differences in the in?uence of U.S. policies. Compared to the GL region policy-in-action scenario contributions of 14% from global policies, 85% from U.S., and 1% from Lake Superior, the UP receives 25% of total deposition decrease from global sources, 70% from the U.S., and 5% from Lake Superior (Table 3). In the Adirondacks region, approximately 89% of the total decrease in deposition for this scenario is due to Clean Air Act regulations in the U.S., while local (Lake Superior Basin) and global (Minamata Convention) each account for 0.1% and 11% of the total decrease, respectively. These values clearly show the signi?cant differences in contributions that proximity to up-wind sources make. The global contribution (as a percentage) of emissions reductions to decreased atmospheric deposition is 2.3 times greater for the UP than for the Adirondacks (Table 3). Sources within the U.S. (mostly coal-?red power plants) provide a greater fraction of the deposition to the Adirondacks as compared to the UP. The minimal-regulation scenario leads to increases in total deposition of 35% and 34% in the GL (Fig. S2') and Michigan's UP region, respectively (Table 3). The similarity in these estimates is likely coincidental. Based on the policy-in-action scenario, differences in deposition bene?t are largely related to U.S.-scale changes in emissions, and the largely U.S. emissions that comprise the minimal-regulation total deposition estimates happen to lead to similar increases in deposition. (Table Presented). The climate change, land use/land cover change, and biomass burning scenarios lead to smaller total Hg deposition changes in 2050 as compared to the policy scenarios (Table 3). In the GL region, these estimates are 3.8% (Fig. S3'), 0% (Fig. S4'), and 1.9% (Fig. S5'), respectively, whereas for Michigan's UP, the changes are 5.2%, 0%, and 2.3%, respectively. The climate change increase is primarily due to an increase in Hg(0) dry deposition and total wet deposition ?uxes. The negligibly small land use/land cover changes are a result of both increases and decreases in land cover in 2050 that in?uence the surfaces to which Hg deposits (Fig. S4'). The increase in deposition from biomass burning is a result of higher biomass burning emissions in the boreal parts of North America and Western U.S. These increases are, in turn, a result of greater ?re activity caused by more vegetation availability and a warmer climate in 2050. 4.1 Regional nature of deposition responses to policy changes Mapping of the projected changes in deposition due to environmental changes (climate, land use/land cover, biomass burning) and policy clearly shows that even within the GL region there is spatial variability (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Areas in close proximity to upwind sources show a larger response to controls of those sources than do areas far from sources. In all locations, the majority of the simulated decrease in deposition is due to decreased Hg(II) deposition rather than Hg(0) deposition; for the GL region as a whole, 80% of the decrease is due to Hg(II) and 20% due to Hg(0). However, in the Adirondacks, 79% of the decrease is due to Hg(II) while in the UP 75% is due to Hg(II). This projected outcome results from the short atmospheric residence time of Hg(II) emissions (0.5'2 days15) and does not re?ect regional differences in availability of oxidants for Hg(0).16 The projected large decrease in Hg(II) deposition is at odds with the absence of a trend in wet deposition of Hg but an observed decrease in litterfall Hg ?uxes in the Adirondacks37 that are postulated to result from recent declines in Hg(0) deposition. According to our scenario modeling, those areas currently receiving the highest rates of atmospheric deposition show the largest percentage decreases in deposition due to enactment of existing policies in the U.S. In contrast, the UP is not downwind of major Hg emission sources. U.S. policy-in-action changes in emissions still represent the majority of changes in deposition in the UP (70%), but the rest of the world contributes 1.8 times more to UP deposition than to the GL region, and 2.3 times more than to the Adirondacks. One implication of these regional differences in trajectories of Hg deposition is that it will be easiest to detect system responses to policy in those regions projected to show the largest responses. This study suggests that it will be difficult to detect policy-related changes in lake monitoring data in Michigan's UP over the next 50 years, unless additional policy steps are taken beyond those included in the scenarios of this project. Similarly, because the predicted changes in deposition due to climate- and land-use changes are small relative to those associated with policy changes, the likelihood is small that those changes can be detected in the GL region unless anthropogenic emissions stabilize. Within the GL region, changes will be easiest to detect in northern Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania (Fig. 2).

Urban transmission of arthropod-vectored disease has increased in recent decades. Understanding and managing transmission potential in urban landscapes requires integration of sociological and ecological processes that regulate vector population dynamics, feeding behaviour and vector-pathogen interactions in these unique ecosystems. Vectorial capacity is a key metric for generating predictive understanding about transmission potential in systems with obligate vector transmission. This review evaluates how urban conditions, specifically habitat suitability and local temperature regimes, and the heterogeneity of urban landscapes can influence the biologically relevant parameters that define vectorial capacity: vector density, survivorship, biting rate, extrinsic incubation period and vector competence. Incidence of vector-borne disease in urban host populations is rarely, if ever, evenly distributed across an urban area. The persistence and quality of vector habitat can vary significantly across socio-economic boundaries to influence vector species composition and abundance, often generating socio-economically distinct gradients of transmission potential across neighbourhoods. Urban regions often experience unique temperature regimes, broadly termed urban heat islands (UHI). Arthropod vectors are ectothermic organisms, and their growth, survival and behaviour are highly sensitive to environmental temperatures. Vector response to UHI conditions is dependent on regional temperature profiles relative to the vector's thermal performance range. In temperate climates, UHI can facilitate increased vector development rates while having countervailing influence on survival and feeding behaviour. Understanding how urban heat island (UHI) conditions alter thermal and moisture constraints across the vector life cycle to influence transmission processes is an important direction for both empirical and modelling research. There remain persistent gaps in understanding of vital rates and drivers in mosquito-vectored disease systems, and vast holes in understanding for other arthropod-vectored diseases. Empirical studies are needed to better understand the physiological constraints and socio-ecological processes that generate heterogeneity in critical transmission parameters, including vector survival and fitness. Likewise, laboratory experiments and transmission models must evaluate vector response to realistic field conditions, such as variability in sociological and environmental conditions.",53,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006297', 'afid': '60006297', 'affilname': 'University of Pennsylvania', 'affiliation-city': 'Philadelphia', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745', 'afid': '60000745', 'affilname': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'affiliation-city': 'Urbana', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['LaDeau S.', 'Allan B.', 'Leisnham P.', 'Levy M.']","['6507835181', '7102506146', '9635314400', '27167569100']",Climate | Mosquito | Pathogen | Socio-ecology | Tick | Triatomine | Urban heat island | Vector | Vectorial capacity,,undefined,,,1211797

The recent spread of mosquito-transmitted viruses and associated disease to the Americas motivates a new, data-driven evaluation of risk in temperate population centers. Temperate regions are generally expected to pose low risk for significant mosquito-borne disease; however, the spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) across densely populated urban areas has established a new landscape of risk. We use a model informed by field data to assess the conditions likely to facilitate local transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses from an infected traveler to Ae. albopictus and then to other humans in USA cities with variable human densities and seasonality. Mosquito-borne disease occurs when specific combinations of conditions maximize virus-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human contact rates. We develop a mathematical model that captures the epidemiology and is informed by current data on vector ecology from urban sites. The model demonstrates that under specific but realistic conditions, fifty-percent of introductions by infectious travelers to a high human, high mosquito density city could initiate local transmission and 10% of the introductions could result in 100 or more people infected. Despite the propensity for Ae. albopictus to bite non-human vertebrates, we also demonstrate that local virus transmission and human outbreaks may occur when vectors feed from humans even just 40% of the time. Inclusion of human behavioral changes and mitigations were not incorporated into the models and would likely reduce predicted infections. This work demonstrates how a conditional series of non-average events can result in local arbovirus transmission and outbreaks of human disease, even in temperate cities.",23,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017672', 'afid': '60017672', 'affilname': 'Tulane University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Orleans', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015457', 'afid': '60015457', 'affilname': 'University of Kansas, Lawrence', 'affiliation-city': 'Lawrence', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010499', 'afid': '60010499', 'affilname': 'University of KwaZulu-Natal', 'affiliation-city': 'Durban', 'affiliation-country': 'South Africa'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007652', 'afid': '60007652', 'affilname': 'Old Dominion University', 'affiliation-city': 'Norfolk', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006164', 'afid': '60006164', 'affilname': 'Los Alamos National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Alamos', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Manore C.', 'Ostfeld R.', 'Agusto F.', 'Gaff H.', 'LaDeau S.']","['37102427300', '7006957295', '9637294600', '57203146785', '6507835181']",,NSF,U01-GM097661,National Science Foundation,,1211797

Discarded vehicle tire casings are an important artificial habitat for the developmental stages of numerous vector mosquitoes. Discarded vehicle tires degrade under ultraviolet light and leach numerous soluble metals (e.g., barium, cadmium, zinc) and organic substances (e.g., benzothiazole and its derivatives [BZTs], polyaromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) that could affect mosquito larvae that inhabit the tire casing. This study examined the relationship between soluble zinc, a common marker of tire leachate, on mosquito densities in tire habitats in the field, and tested the effects of tire leachate on the survival and development of newly hatched Aedes albopictus and Aedes triseriatus larvae in a controlled laboratory dose-response experiment. In the field, zinc concentrations were as high as 7.26 mg/L in a single tire and averaged as high as 2.39 (SE - 1.17) mg/L among tires at a single site. Aedes albopictus (37/42 tires, 81.1%) and A. triseriatus (23/42, 54.8%) were the most widespread mosquito species, co-occurred in over half (22/42, 52.4%) of all tires, and A. triseriatus was only collected without A. albopictus in one tire. Aedes triseriatus was more strongly negatively associated with zinc concentration than A. albopictus, and another common mosquito, C. pipiens, which was found in 17 tires. In the laboratory experiment, A. albopictus per capita rate of population change (λ') was over 1.0, indicating positive population growth, from 0-8.9 mg/L zinc concentration (0-10,000 mg/L tire leachate), but steeply declined to zero from 44.50-89.00 mg/L zinc (50,000-100,000 mg/L tire leachate). In contrast, A. triseriatus declined at the lower concentration of 0.05 mg/L zinc (100 mg/L tire leachate), and was zero at 0.45, 8.90, 44.50, and 89.00 mg/L zinc (500, 10,000, 50,000 and 100,000 mg/L tire leachate). These results indicate that tire leachate can have severe negative effects on populations of container-utilizing mosquitoes at concentrations commonly found in the field. Superior tolerance to tire leachate of A. albopictus compared to A. triseriatus, and possibly other native mosquito species, may have facilitated the replacement of these native species as A. albopictus has invaded North America and other regions around the world.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304', 'afid': '60020304', 'affilname': 'University of Maryland', 'affiliation-city': 'College Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011001', 'afid': '60011001', 'affilname': 'Kyoto University', 'affiliation-city': 'Kyoto', 'affiliation-country': 'Japan'}]",Journal,Article,"['Villena O.', 'Terry I.', 'Iwata K.', 'Landa E.', 'LaDeau S.', 'Leisnham P.']","['57195579740', '57195573707', '57189661704', '7006777561', '6507835181', '9635314400']",Asian tiger mosquito | Competition | Invasion biology | Pest control | Tire leachate | Toxins | Urbanization | West nile virus | Zinc,,DEB-1211797,,,1211797

Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) satellite imagery is an important data source for many applications. However, the scan line corrector (SLC) failed on 31 May 2003. As a result of the SLC failure, about 22% of the image data is missing in each scene; this is especially pronounced away from nadir. In this article, a local regression method called geographically weighted regression (GWR) is introduced for filling the gaps of the Landsat ETM+ imagery, and it is compared with kriging/cokriging for this purpose. The case studies show that the GWR approach is an effective technique to fill gaps in Landsat ETM+ imagery, although the image restoration is still not perfect. GWR performed marginally better than the complex cokriging method, which too has proven to be an effective method, but is computationally intensive. Although there are visible seam lines at the edges of the filled wide gaps in some bands, the validation results – including RMSE values, error distribution maps, and classification results for the case studies – demonstrate that the DN values estimated by GWR are in fact closer to those of the original image than the corresponding values estimated by kriging/cokriging.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang C.', 'Li W.', 'Civco D.']","['56096971200', '35368706300', '6701563801']",,NSF,1049017,National Science Foundation,,1414108

This study introduces a Bayesian Markov chain random field (MCRF) cosimulation approach for improving land-use/land-cover (LULC) classification accuracy through integrating expert-interpreted data and pre-classified image data. The expert-interpreted data are used as conditioning sample data in cosimulation, and may be interpreted from various sources. The pre-classification can be performed using any convenient conventional method. The approach uses the recently suggested MCRF cosimulation algorithm (Co-MCSS) to take a pre-classified image as auxiliary data while performing cosimulations conditioned on expert-interpreted data. It was tested using a series of expert-interpreted data sets and an image data set pre-classified by the supervised maximum likelihood (SML) algorithm. Results show that with the density of the interpreted data (pixel labels) increasing from 0 to 1.81 % of total pixels, the accuracy of optimal classification maps from Co-MCSS improves by 8.49 to 20.96 %, being much higher than that generated by SML and those purely conditioned on expert-interpreted data. This means that expert-interpreted data may largely contribute to the accuracy of LULC classification from remotely sensed imagery, and inversely the pre-classified image data also can largely contribute to the accuracy of LULC classes simulated by the MCRF approach based on expert-interpreted data. Therefore, the proposed approach can improve classification accuracy of pre-classified maps as long as some expert-interpreted data are available. The main advantage of this approach is that it may comprehensively utilize a variety of available information seamlessly to LULC classification through expert interpretation and spatial cosimulation.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000840', 'afid': '60000840', 'affilname': 'International Food Policy Research Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Li W.', 'Zhang C.', 'Willig M.', 'Dey D.', 'Wang G.', 'You L.']","['35368706300', '56096971200', '7003499228', '7101867803', '36127012800', '9743314500']",Bayesian inference | Cosimulation | Expert interpretation | Geostatistics | Land cover classification | Markov chain | Remotely sensed image,,undefined,,,1414108

Land price plays an important role in guiding land resource allocation for urban planning and development, particularly in big cities of fast developing countries where infrastructures and populations change frequently. Therefore, detecting spatially implicit information in the spatial pattern of relationships between land price and related impact factors is critical. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis was conducted in this study for the purpose in Wuhan, China, by using a 10-year panel data set of residential land price. Based on twelve factors in three aspects (land attributes, location factors and neighborhood attributes), an evaluation index system of resident land price was established. The spatial distributions of estimated coefficients and pseudo t-values of three major explanatory variables (floor area ratio, distance to nearest center business district (CBD) and distance to nearest lake), obtained from GWR analysis, indicated that their relationships of the impact factors with land price are spatially non-stationary. The positive impact of floor area ratio on land price is more significant in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Conversely, the negative impact of distance to nearest CBD on land price is larger in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Moreover, wealthier dwellers may be willing to pay a higher price for a good lake view (especially views of small lakes), but infrastructure barriers (near some large lakes) cause negative effect.

We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants' distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for A. petiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source-sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline.

Land use and land cover (LULC) patterns play an important role in the establishment and spread of invasive plants. Understanding LULC changes is useful for early detection and management of land-use change to reduce the spread of invasive species. The primary objective of this study is to analyze and predict LULC changes in Connecticut. LULC maps for 1996, 2001 and 2006 were selected to analyze past land cover changes, and then potential LULC distribution in 2018 was predicted using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov Chain (MLP_MC) model. This study shows that the total area of forest has been decreasing, mainly caused by urban development and other human activity in Connecticut. The model predicts that the study area will lose 5535 ha of deciduous forest and gain 3502 ha of built-up area from 2006 to 2018. Moreover, forests near built-up areas and agriculture lands appear to be more vulnerable to conversion.

The Long Island Sound Watersheds (LISW) are experiencing significant land use/cover change (LUCC), which affects the environment and ecosystems in the watersheds through water pollution, carbon emissions, and loss of wildlife. LUCC modeling is an important approach to understanding what has happened in the landscape and what may change in the future. Moreover, prospective modeling can provide sustainable and efficient decision support for land planning and environmental management. This paper modeled the LUCCs between 1996, 2001 and 2006 in the LISW in the New England region, which experienced an increase in developed area and a decrease of forest. The low-density development pattern played an important role in the loss of forest and the expansion of urban areas. The key driving forces were distance to developed areas, distance to roads, and social-economic drivers, such as nighttime light intensity and population density. In addition, this paper compared and evaluated two integrated LUCC models-the logistic regression-Markov chain model and the multi-layer perception-Markov chain (MLP-MC) model. Both models achieved high accuracy in prediction, but the MLP-MC model performed slightly better. Finally, a land use map for 2026 was predicted by using the MLP-MC model, and it indicates the continued loss of forest and increase of developed area.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhai R.', 'Zhang C.', 'Li W.', 'Boyer M.', 'Hanink D.']","['57194213170', '56096971200', '35368706300', '35895239200', '6603048082']",Land use/cover change | Logistic regression | Long Island sound watersheds | Markov chain | Multi-layer perception | Nighttime lights,,undefined,,,1414108

Urban growth consists of horizontal and vertical expansions. An integrative framework for estimating horizontal and vertical expansions of city urban areas using Landsat images was presented. It includes following steps: (1) a spectrum-based classifier (here Support Vector Machine) is first used to preclassify Landsat images; (2) the spectral similarity-enhanced Markov chain random field cosimulation model is then applied to postclassify the preclassified images and detect building shadows; and (3) a morphological operator based on spatial logic reasoning is used to estimate mid-rise or taller buildings (MTBs) from detected shadows. Both horizontal urban growth and vertical urban growth in the main city area of Guangzhou for the time period of 1993–2013 were detected. The accuracy of identified MTBs by shadows was validated to be 78.1% on average for 2013. The case study indicates that Guangzhou had undergone both horizontal and vertical urban growth from 1993 to 2013, and vertical urban growth followed horizontal urban growth successively. The relationships between the horizontal and vertical urban growth and three major socioeconomic factors during the studied period were analysed. Results indicate that both the total area of built-up areas and the total area of detected MTBs are significantly correlated with population density, real gross domestic product, and fixed investment (i.e. investment in fixed assets such as land, buildings), respectively. While population density is the major driving force of horizontal urban expansion, fixed investment is the major driving force of vertical urban expansion for the city as a whole. Although themethod is not perfect currently in detectingMTBs in various situations and the case study is mainly exploratory, the proposed framework and the case study can be helpful in quantitatively exploring the horizontal urbangrowthandverticalurbangrowth of a city and their causes.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang W.', 'Li W.', 'Zhang C.', 'Ouimet W.']","['56877952500', '35368706300', '57201189803', '7801682185']",,NSF,1414108,National Science Foundation,,1414108

Spatial statistics provides useful methods for incorporating spatial dependence into land cover classification. However, the geometric features of land cover classes are difficult to be captured by geostatistical models due to smoothing effect. The objective of this study is to incorporate spectral similarity into the Markov chain random field (MCRF) cosimulation (coMCRF) model, that is, to propose a spectral similarity-enhanced MCRF cosimulation (SS-coMCRF) model, for land cover postclassification so that postclassification will cause less geometric loss. Two mutually complementary spectral similarity measures, Jaccard index and the spectral correlation measure, were employed as a constraining factor in SS-coMCRF. One medium spatial resolution scene with a complex landscape and one very high spatial resolution scene with an urban landscape were selected for case studies. Neural network classifier and support vector machine classifier were used to conduct land cover preclassifications. Both coMCRF and SS-coMCRF were used to postprocess preclassified images based on expert-interpreted sample datasets from multiple data sources. Compared with preclassified results that depend on only spectral information of pixels, postclassifications by both models achieved similar significant improvements in overall accuracy. However, compared with coMCRF, the SS-coMCRF model apparently improved postclassified land cover patterns by effectively capturing some geometric features (e.g., boundaries and linear stripes) and more details of land cover classes.

However, no study mapped land use in megacity using GSV-derived features or the three kinds of data together for land use classification. The main objectives of this study are (1) to test the performance of a parcel-based land use classification method using a Random Forest classifier with LiDAR data, HRO, and GSV images in a megacity, and (2) to explore the use of GSV in separating parcels of mixed residential & commercial buildings from other land use parcels. Two neighboring community districts in Brooklyn, New York, were selected as the study area. Thirteen automatically-derived parcel features, including nine common parcel features and four GSV-derived parcel features, were used in land use classification. The average overall classification accuracy was 77.5%, with producer's accuracies exceeding 92% for single-family housing. Comparing the results of classifications with and without GSV-derived parcel features shows that GSV-derived parcel features on average contribute to the classification accuracy of mixed residential & commercial buildings by 10 percentage points, improving it from 41.3% to 51.4%. In general, the results show that even in a complex megacity, the parcel-based land use classification technique, with parcel features extracted from airborne LiDAR, HRO, and GSV, is able to discriminate among different land use classes, such as single-family house, commercial & industrial building, and open space & park, with acceptable accuracies, and that integrating GSV into classification improves the classification accuracy of some urban land use classes, especially mixed residential & commercial building.",26,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang W.', 'Li W.', 'Zhang C.', 'Hanink D.', 'Li X.', 'Wang W.']","['56877952500', '35368706300', '56096971200', '6603048082', '56342422200', '57193572828']",Classification | Google Street View | LiDAR | Megacity | Parcel feature | Urban land use,,1414108,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0198971516302733,1414108

Web Feature Service (WFS) is a protocol for accessing geospatial data stores such as databases and Shapefiles over the Web. However, WFS does not provide direct access to data distributed in multiple servers. In addition, WFS features extracted from their original sources are not convenient for user access due to the lack of connection to high-level concepts. Users are facing the choices of either querying each WFS server first and then integrating the results, or converting the data from all WFS servers to a more expressive format such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and then querying the integrated data. The first choice requires additional programming while the second choice is not practical for large or frequently updated datasets. The new contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel adaptive and optimized RDF query interface to overcome the aforementioned limitation. Specifically, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to query and synthesize distributed WFS data through an RDF query interface, where users can specify data requests to multiple WFS servers using a single RDF query. Users can also define a simple configuration to associate WFS feature types, attributes, and values with RDF classes, properties, and values so that user queries can be written using a more uniform and informative vocabulary. The algorithm translates each RDF query written in SPARQL-like syntax to multiple WFS GetFeature requests, and then converts and integrates the multiple WFS results to get the answers to the original query. The generated GetFeature requests are sent asynchronously and simultaneously to WFS servers to take advantage of the server parallelism. The results of each GetFeature request are cached to improve query response time for subsequent queries that involve one or more of the cached requests. A JavaScript-based prototype is implemented and experimental results show that the query response time can be greatly reduced through fine-grained caching.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019909', 'afid': '60019909', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee', 'affiliation-city': 'Milwaukee', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhao T.', 'Chuanrong Z.', 'Li W.']","['7402268093', '57193848929', '35368706300']",Caching | JavaScript | RDF | SPARQL | WFS,,undefined,,,1414108

Published by Oxford University Press. Humans are the most important drivers of global invasive species introduction and natural habitat transformation. An understanding of the relationships between these impacts is needed to understand how we may prevent future species invasions. We explored the ecological differences between areas of dense human habitation and minimally managed natural habitats across an urban-to-rural gradient of land use in southern New England. Urban habitats were significantly different environmentally from rural habitats. Urban soils were more alkaline and coarse textured and had higher lead concentrations than rural soils. Urban habitats had more open canopies, impervious surface, patch forests and induced edge habitats than rural habitats. We also examined differences in presence/absence patterns and leaf functional traits for a set of invasive species across an urban to rural environmental gradient. Some species were more restricted to urban or rural sites than others along this gradient. A priori urban-classified species tended to show trait values associated with drought tolerance, including higher leaf length-to-width ratio, greater leaf thickness, higher leaf dry matter content and lower specific leaf area. Our findings suggest that urban environmental conditions contribute to an 'urban drought island' syndrome that favors drought-tolerant species.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ariori C.', 'Aiello-Lammens M.', 'Silander J.']","['57197780282', '16204946700', '6603757875']",Invasive species | New England | Urban ecology | Urbanization,,2008-35615-19014,,,1414108

Land-use maps are important references for urban planning and urban studies. Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the façades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their façade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so.

The Markov chain random field (MCRF) model is a spatial statistical approach for modeling categorical spatial variables in multiple dimensions. However, this approach tends to be computationally costly when dealing with large data sets because of its sequential simulation processes. Therefore, improving its computational efficiency is necessary in order to run this model on larger sizes of spatial data. In this study, we suggested four parallel computing solutions by using both central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for executing the sequential simulation algorithm of the MCRF model, and compared them with the nonparallel computing solution on computation time spent for a land cover post-classification. The four parallel computing solutions are: (1) multicore processor parallel computing (MP), (2) parallel computing by GPU-accelerated nearest neighbor searching (GNNS), (3) MP with GPU-accelerated nearest neighbor searching (MP-GNNS), and (4) parallel computing by GPU-accelerated approximation and GPU-accelerated nearest neighbor searching (GA-GNNS). Experimental results indicated that all of the four parallel computing solutions are at least 1.8× faster than the nonparallel solution.

This study makes use of the new approach to examine the horizontal and vertical urban expansion of three capital megacities (Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo) in East Asia during the late 1980s to the mid-2010s. In contrast to previous studies that only assessed horizontal urban growth, which usually showed almost no increase in urban area in some highly developed cities, this study indicates some different findings: (1) Both horizontal and vertical urban expansion had been happening in the three megacities during the studied period, especially with respect to vertical urban expansion. During the studied period there were 20.7 km2, 11.3 km2, and 6.8 km2 MTB area increases in Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo, respectively. (2) Different cities showed some differences in growth patterns, mainly because they were at different urban development stages and impacted by different local situations in terms of geography, population, and development policies.

Context: Landscape metrics play an important role in measurement, analysis, and interpretation of spatial patterns of landscapes. There are a variety of different landscape metrics widely used in landscape ecology. However, existing landscape metrics are mostly non-graphic and single-value indices, which may not be sufficient to describe the complex spatial correlation and interclass relationships of various landscapes. As a transition probability diagram over the lag distance, the transiogram, which emerged in recent years, essentially provides a new graphic metric for measuring and visualizing the auto and cross correlations of landscape categories. Objectives: To explore the capability of the transiogram for measuring spatial patterns of categorical landscape maps and compare it with existing landscape metrics. Methods: Sixteen commonly-used landscape metrics and transiograms (including auto- and cross-transiograms) were estimated and compared for land cover/use classes in four areas with different landscapes. Results: Results show that (1) these transiograms can provide visual information about the proportions, aggregation levels, interclass adjacencies, and intra-class/interclass correlation ranges of landscape classes; (2) sills and auto-correlation ranges of transiograms are correlated with the values of some landscape metrics; and (3) the peak height ratios of idealized transiograms can effectively represent the juxtaposition strength of neighboring class pairs. Conclusions: The transiogram can be an effective graphic metric for characterizing the auto-correlation of single classes (through auto-transiograms) and the complex interclass relationships, such as interdependency and juxtaposition, between different landscape classes (through cross-transiograms).",1,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhai R.', 'Li W.', 'Zhang C.', 'Zhang W.', 'Wang W.']","['57194213170', '35368706300', '57201189803', '56877952500', '57193572828']",Graphic metric | Landscape metrics | Spatial pattern | Transiogram | Transition probability | Visual information,NSF,1414108,National Science Foundation,,1414108

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Traditional methods of detecting and mapping utility poles are inefficient and costly because of the demand for visual interpretation with quality data sources or intense field inspection. The advent of deep learning for object detection provides an opportunity for detecting utility poles from side-view optical images. In this study, we proposed using a deep learning-based method for automatically mapping roadside utility poles with crossarms (UPCs) from Google Street View (GSV) images. The method combines the state-of-the-art DL object detection algorithm (i.e., the RetinaNet object detection algorithm) and a modified brute-force-based line-of-bearing (LOB, a LOB stands for the ray towards the location of the target [UPC at here] from the original location of the sensor [GSV mobile platform]) measurement method to estimate the locations of detected roadside UPCs from GSV. Experimental results indicate that: (1) both the average precision (AP) and the overall accuracy (OA) are around 0.78 when the intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold is greater than 0.3, based on the testing of 500 GSV images with a total number of 937 objects; and (2) around 2.6%, 47%, and 79% of estimated locations of utility poles are within 1 m, 5 m, and 10 m buffer zones, respectively, around the referenced locations of utility poles. In general, this study indicates that even in a complex background, most utility poles can be detected with the use of DL, and the LOB measurement method can estimate the locations of most UPCs.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659', 'afid': '60022659', 'affilname': 'University of Connecticut', 'affiliation-city': 'Storrs', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195', 'afid': '60022195', 'affilname': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Zhang W.', 'Witharana C.', 'Li W.', 'Zhang C.', 'Li X.', 'Parent J.']","['56877952500', '55453025500', '35368706300', '57201189803', '56342422200', '35099253600']",Deep learning | Google street view | Infrastructure mapping | Line-of-bearing measurement | Object detection | Utility pole,,1414108,,,1414108

The Authors. Growth in wind power production has motivated investigation of wind-farm impacts on in situ flow fields and downstream interactions with agriculture and other wind farms. These impacts can be simulated with both large-eddy simulations (LES) and mesoscale wind-farm parameterizations (WFP). The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model offers both approaches. We used the validated generalized actuator disk (GAD) parameterization in WRF-LES to assess WFP performance. A 12-turbine array was simulated using the GAD model and the WFP in WRF. We examined the performance of each scheme in both convective and stable conditions. The GAD model and WFP produced qualitatively similar wind speed deficits and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production across the array in both stability regimes, though the magnitudes of velocity deficits and TKE production levels were underestimated and overestimated, respectively. While wake growth slowed in the latter half of the WFP array as expected, wakes did not approach steady state by the end of the array as simulated by the GAD model. A sensitivity test involving the deactivation of explicit TKE production by the WFP resulted in turbulence levels within the array well that were below those produced by the GAD in both stable and unstable conditions. Finally, the WFP overestimated downwind power production deficits in stable conditions because of the lack of wake stabilization in the latter half of the array.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030451', 'afid': '60030451', 'affilname': 'National Renewable Energy Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Golden', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026175', 'afid': '60026175', 'affilname': 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Livermore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021243', 'afid': '60021243', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Vanderwende B.', 'Kosović B.', 'Lundquist J.', 'Mirocha J.']","['55376561000', '6602729251', '35569011300', '9233435600']",actuator-disk model | LES | RANS | turbine wakes | wind-farm parameterization | WRF,NREL,APUP UGA-0-41026-22,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,1413980

The lower wind speeds and increased turbulence that are characteristic of turbine wakes have considerable consequences on large wind farms: turbines located downwind generate less power and experience increased turbulent loads. The structures of wakes and their downwind impacts are sensitive to wind speed and atmospheric variability. Wake characterization can provide important insights for turbine layout optimization in view of decreasing the cost of wind energy. The CWEX-13 field campaign, which took place between June and September 2013 in a wind farm in Iowa, was designed to explore the interaction of multiple wakes in a range of atmospheric stability conditions. Based on lidar wind measurements, we extend, present, and apply a quantitative algorithm to assess wake parameters such as the velocity deficits, the size of the wake boundaries, and the location of the wake centerlines. We focus on wakes from a row of four turbines at the leading edge of the wind farm to explore variations between wakes from the edge of the row (outer wakes) and those from turbines in the center of the row (inner wakes). Using multiple horizontal scans at different elevations, a three-dimensional structure of wakes from the row of turbines can be created. Wakes Erode very quickly during unstable conditions and can in fact be detected primarily in stable conditions in the conditions measured here. During stable conditions, important differences emerge between the wakes of inner turbines and the wakes of outer turbines. Further, the strong wind veer associated with stable conditions results in a stretching of the wake structures, and this stretching manifests differently for inner and outer wakes. These insights can be incorporated into low-order wake models for wind farm layout optimization or for wind power forecasting.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030451', 'afid': '60030451', 'affilname': 'National Renewable Energy Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Golden', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015986', 'afid': '60015986', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Trento', 'affiliation-city': 'Trento', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bodini N.', 'Zardi D.', 'Lundquist J.']","['57195362269', '6603536554', '35569011300']",,NREL,APUP UGA-0-41026-22,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,1413980

A generalized actuator line (GAL) wind turbine parameterization is implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting model to enable high-fidelity large-eddy simulations of wind turbine interactions with boundary layer flows under realistic atmospheric forcing conditions. Numerical simulations using the GAL parameterization are evaluated against both an already implemented generalized actuator disk (GAD) wind turbine parameterization and two field campaigns that measured the inflow and near-wake regions of a single turbine. The representation of wake wind speed, variance, and vorticity distributions is examined by comparing fine-resolution GAL and GAD simulations and GAD simulations at both fine and coarse-resolutions. The higher-resolution simulations show slightly larger and more persistent velocity deficits in the wake and substantially increased variance and vorticity when compared to the coarse-resolution GAD. The GAL generates distinct tip and root vortices that maintain coherence as helical tubes for approximately one rotor diameter downstream. Coarse-resolution simulations using the GAD produce similar aggregated wake characteristics to both fine-scale GAD and GAL simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. The GAL parameterization provides the capability to resolve near wake physics, including vorticity shedding and wake expansion.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030451', 'afid': '60030451', 'affilname': 'National Renewable Energy Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Golden', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026175', 'afid': '60026175', 'affilname': 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Livermore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025038', 'afid': '60025038', 'affilname': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliation-city': 'Berkeley', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015590', 'afid': '60015590', 'affilname': 'University Corporation for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Marjanovic N.', 'Mirocha J.', 'Kosović B.', 'Lundquist J.', 'Chow F.']","['56810959900', '9233435600', '6602729251', '35569011300', '7005264401']",,NREL,APUP UGA-0-41026-22,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,1413980

The Authors. Multiscale modeling of a diurnal cycle of real-world conditions is presented for the first time, validated using data from the CWEX-13 field experiment. Dynamical downscaling from synoptic-scale down to resolved three-dimensional eddies in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was performed, spanning 4 orders of magnitude in horizontal grid resolution: from 111 km down to 8.2 m (30 m) in stable (convective) conditions. Computationally efficient mesoscale-to-microscale transition was made possible by the generalized cell perturbation method with time-varying parameters derived from mesoscale forcing conditions, which substantially reduced the fetch to achieve fully developed turbulence. In addition, careful design of the simulations was made to inhibit the presence of under-resolved convection at convection-resolving mesoscale resolution and to ensure proper turbulence representation in stably-stratified conditions. Comparison to in situ wind-profiling lidar and near-surface sonic anemometer measurements demonstrated the ability to reproduce the ABL structure throughout the entire diurnal cycle with a high degree of fidelity. The multiscale simulations exhibit realistic atmospheric features such as convective rolls and global intermittency. Also, the diurnal evolution of turbulence was accurately simulated, with probability density functions of resolved turbulent velocity fluctuations nearly identical to the lidar measurements. Explicit representation of turbulence in the stably-stratified ABL was found to provide the right balance with larger scales, resulting in the development of intra-hour variability as observed by the wind lidar; this variability was not captured by the mesoscale model. Moreover, multiscale simulations improved mean ABL characteristics such as horizontal velocity, vertical wind shear, and turbulence.",32,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030451', 'afid': '60030451', 'affilname': 'National Renewable Energy Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Golden', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021243', 'afid': '60021243', 'affilname': 'National Center for Atmospheric Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006164', 'afid': '60006164', 'affilname': 'Los Alamos National Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Los Alamos', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221', 'afid': '60000221', 'affilname': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'affiliation-city': 'Boulder', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Muñoz-Esparza D.', 'Lundquist J.', 'Sauer J.', 'Kosović B.', 'Linn R.']","['26023688200', '35569011300', '57146578400', '6602729251', '7005044056']",atmospheric boundary layers | CWEX-13 | large-eddy simulation | multiscale modeling | turbulence | WRF,NREL,APUP UGA-0-41026-22,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,1413980

Therefore, the wind energy industry has great interest in determining the spatial dimensions of offshore wind farm wakes to assess the economical potential of planned wind farms. In this work we use wake measurements conducted by a research aircraft to evaluate the performance of a wind farm parameterization (WFP) in a mesoscale model during stably-stratified atmospheric conditions, in which the wake is expected to be the strongest. The observations were conducted on the 10 September 2016 within the project WIPAFF (Wind PArk Far Field) at the North Sea. The observations allow evaluation of both the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of the wake. The model simulates the length and most of the time the spatial dimensions of the wake.

Collective action has played a vital role in managing common pool resources in numerous global contexts. This article explores the factors affecting collective action related to the removal of the mile-a-minute weed (Mikania micrantha, referred to as Mikania), an invasive plant, in community forests in the buffer zone region around Chitwan National Park in Chitwan, Nepal. Few studies have combined larger sample size quantitative data with greater generalizability and nuanced, qualitative data to explore what factors influence collective action or focused on how perception of the issue at multiple levels affects outcomes. This research employs household and community forest management survey data from 21 community forests in and near the buffer zone of Chitwan National Park in Nepal. Our multilevel econometric analyses, including an analysis examining geographic space using eigenvectors, investigate what influences local people's participation in Mikania removal and we contextualize the findings with case-study interview data. Our results indicate that reliance on community forest resources, perception of the issue, and neighborhood sizes influence are influential factors in their participation in Mikania removal.

Differences in governance relationships and community efforts to remove an exotic, rapidly spreading invasive plant, the-mile-a-minute weed (Mikania micrantha), are explored in five case study community forests in the subtropical region of Chitwan, Nepal. An institutional analysis informs an examination of the de jure (formal) versus de facto (on the ground) institutions and actor relationships relevant to Mikania removal efforts. Contrary to the expectations set by the de jure situation, we find heterogeneous governance relationships and norms related to Mikania management across community forests. Content analysis of interview data illuminates reoccurring themes and their implications for social and ecological outcomes in the communities. Complex governance relationships and regular discussion of distrust of government and non-government officials help explain collective action efforts and management decisions. The content analysis suggests that Mikania is impacting people’s daily lives but the degree of severity and the response to the disruption varies substantially and is affected by other problems experienced by community forest members. Our results indicate that understanding how the de facto, or on the ground situation, differs from the de jure institutions may be vital in structuring successful efforts to manage invasive species and understanding collective action problems related to other social-ecological threats.

All rights reserved. There are multiple theories regarding how institutions change over time, but institutional change is often difficult to study and understand in practice. Agent-based modeling is known as a technique to explore emergent phenomena resulting from the micro level activities and interactions between heterogeneous agents and between agents and the environment. Such models allow researchers to investigate theories which may otherwise be difficult to examine. We present a theoretically driven agent-based model to explore two perspectives on institutional change, rational choice and cultural diffusion, in the context of invasive plant management in Chitwan, Nepal. The Chitwan region is grappling with the spread of the invasive mile-a-minute weed, Mikania micrantha (Mikania). We focus on understanding which perspective of institutional change better fits empirical survey data on Mikania management. We find that rational choice is an unlikely candidate for institutional change in Chitwan and that the social learning and imitation mechanism modeled in the cultural diffusion perspective better replicates empirical patterns. Additionally, the model reveals that the percentage of agents adopting the best practice removal method is not as influential in reducing Mikania as the initial amount of Mikania removed. This result indicates that it may be useful to conduct an empirical assessment varying the initial amount of Mikania removed to understand the management implications for successful removal of Mikania in Chitwan and elsewhere.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018926', 'afid': '60018926', 'affilname': 'San Diego State University', 'affiliation-city': 'San Diego', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sullivan A.', 'An L.', 'York A.']","['56088772000', '7102775296', '8639695600']",Agent-based model | Collective action | Institutions | Invasive pest,,SES-1462086,National Science Foundation,,1658209

Recent settlement, soil resource, and vegetation surveys were completed during a re-evaluation of the earthworks of Tikal. The objective of this research was to combine non-parametric multiplicative regression, stable carbon isotopes, soil properties, and remote-sensing data for cost-effective, predictive modelling of ancient maize (Zea mays L.) agricultural areas. The study area is positioned within a 300 km2 region surrounding the Tikal site centre (17° 13′ 19.0″ N, 89° 27′ 25.2″ W). In the study area, ancient maize agriculture was determined using carbon (C) isotopic signatures of C4 vegetation that were incorporated into the soil humin fraction. Probability models predicting C isotopic enrichment were used to outline areas of potential long-term maize agriculture. A binomial model predicted areas mainly along the bajo margins, indicating that these areas may have been used for sustained ancient maize agriculture. Upland areas with shallow Rendolls soil were found to lack strong C4 isotopic signatures. They showed a long-term C3 vegetation signature that could have supported native forest, silvicultural activities, or C3 cropping practices (i.e. forest gardens). The mosaic of C3 and C4 signatures within the study site soils suggests that the Tikal area supported a variety of food production systems. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006832', 'afid': '60006832', 'affilname': 'Brigham Young University', 'affiliation-city': 'Provo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001439', 'afid': '60001439', 'affilname': 'Pennsylvania State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Balzotti C.', 'Webster D.', 'Murtha T.', 'Petersen S.', 'Burnett R.', 'Terry R.']","['36477059200', '22990229900', '26322697000', '36852156000', '35851935600', '7202320006']",,NSF,BCS-0443280,National Science Foundation,,1211809

Although it is widely understood that personal values and beliefs, social norms, economics, and policies influence farmer decisionmaking, very little is known about decisionmaking specific to fertilizer management. In addition, little is known about the socioeconomic influences on decisionmaking across scales and how ecological change is perceived and responded to.

In these regions the adaptation challenge is complicated by the fact that elevation contrasts and dissected topography produce diverse climatic conditions that are often accompanied by significant ecological and agricultural diversity within a relatively small region. Such is the case for the Choke Mountain watersheds, in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia. These watersheds extend from tropical alpine environments at over 4000 m elevation to the hot and dry Blue Nile gorge that includes areas below 1000 m elevation, and contain a diversity of slope forms and soil types. This physical diversity and accompanying socio-economic contrasts demand diverse strategies for enhanced climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. To support development of locally appropriate climate resilience strategies across the Blue Nile Highlands, we present here an agroecosystem analysis of Choke Mountain, under the premise that the agroecosystem-the intersection of climatic and physiographic conditions with agricultural practices-is the most appropriate unit for defining adaptation strategies in these primarily subsistence agriculture communities. To this end, we present two approaches to agroecosystem analysis that can be applied to climate resilience studies in the Choke Mountain watersheds and, as appropriate, to other agroecologically diverse regions attempting to design climate adaptation strategies. First, a full agroecoystem analysis was implemented in collaboration with local communities. It identified six distinct agroecosystems that differ systematically in constraints and adaptation potential. This analysis was then paired with an objective landscape classification trained to identify agroecosystems based on climate and physiographic setting alone. It was found that the distribution of Choke Mountain watershed agroecosystems can, to first order, be explained as a function of prevailing climate. This suggests that the conditions that define current agroecosystems are likely to migrate under a changing climate, requiring adaptive management strategies. These agroecosystems show a remarkable degree of differentiation in terms of production orientation and socio-economic characteristics of the farming communities suggesting different options and interventions towards building resilience to climate change. ©2013 by the authors.",22,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071181', 'afid': '60071181', 'affilname': 'Addis Ababa University', 'affiliation-city': 'Addis Ababa', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Simane B.', 'Zaitchik B.', 'Ozdogan M.']","['6603056316', '6507498114', '7003494809']",Adaptation | Agroecosystem | Climate change | Ethiopia,NSF,GEO-1211235,National Science Foundation,,1211235

In topographically diverse highland terrain, socio-economic and environmental conditions can vary dramatically over relatively short distances. This presents a challenge for climate resilient development strategies, as exposure to climate variability and change, climate impacts, and adaptive capacity differ between communities located within common cultural and administrative units. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framed within the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC) offers a tool to assess climate vulnerability through direct household surveys. This makes it particularly appropriate for analyses at sub-community and community scales. Here we apply the LVI-IPCC to communities of Choke Mountain, located in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia. Recognizing the physiographic and climatic diversity that exists in this mountainous environment, we implement LVI-IPCC analysis for 793 mixed crop-livestock farming households using the five distinct agroecological systems (AES) that compose the populated area of Choke Mountain as a framework for analysis. For each AES, an LVI index, adaptive capacity metric, and LVI-IPCC vulnerability score was calculated. We found that each of these metrics varied systematically across AES. High elevation sloping lands and low elevation steep lands exhibited relatively low adaptive capacity and high vulnerability while midland AES had higher capacity and lower vulnerability. These results suggest that resilience building interventions for Choke Mountain ecosystems should be targeted to address the specific circumstances of each AES. The approach of applying LVI-IPCC at AES scale could be applicable to other climate vulnerable mountainous regions.",38,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071181', 'afid': '60071181', 'affilname': 'Addis Ababa University', 'affiliation-city': 'Addis Ababa', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Simane B.', 'Zaitchik B.', 'Foltz J.']","['6603056316', '6507498114', '7003668907']",Adaptive capacity | Agroecosystem | Climate change | Exposure | Vulnerability,AAU,GEO-1211235,Addis Ababa University,,1211235

Ranking the performance of global climate models (GCMs) is a notoriously difficult exercise. Multi-model comparison studies nearly always show that each model has strengths and weaknesses relative to others, and for many purposes the multi-model ensemble mean delivers better estimates than any individual model. Nevertheless, in regions like East Africa, where there is little consensus between models on the magnitude or sign of 21st century precipitation change, the multi-model ensemble mean approach to climate projection provides little value for adaptation planning. Here, we consider several possible frameworks for model evaluation and ranking, and assess the differences in performance of a subset of models participating in the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) according to each framework. Our test case is precipitation in the Nile River headwaters regions. We find that there is little consistency in the relative performance of models across frameworks based on amount and seasonality of precipitation, interannual precipitation variability, precipitation teleconnections, and continental scale climate patterns. These analyses offer some guidance on which GCMs are most likely to provide meaningful results for specific applications, but they caution that any effort to select 'best performing' GCMs for the Nile River basin must carefully consider the purposes for which GCMs are being selected.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027716', 'afid': '60027716', 'affilname': 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Bhattacharjee P.', 'Zaitchik B.']","['35621564700', '6507498114']",Climate change | CMIP5 | GCM | Nile River | Water resources,,undefined,,,1211235

Despite this, there is a lack of knowledge on macroinvertebrate responses to human disturbances and the application of biological monitoring in tropical highland waterways in general. In this study, we have evaluated the human impact on the ecological integrity of the Chemoga River catchment in the Choke mountain watershed in the northwestern region of the Ethiopian Blue Nile highlands. During wet and dry seasons the water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed. Multivariate statistics and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were used to identify factors influencing macroinvertebrate community structures in highland streams in the northwest regions of Ethiopia. A total of 66 taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates were recorded, among which Diptera (38%) and Coleoptera (21%) were the most dominant.

Many studies have documented dramatic climatic and environmental changes that have affected Africa over different time scales. These studies often raise questions regarding the spatial extent and regional connectivity of changes inferred from observations and proxies and/or derived from climate models. Objective regionalization offers a tool for addressing these questions. To demonstrate this potential, applications of hierarchical climate regionalizations of Africa using observations and GCM historical simulations and future projections are presented. First, Africa is regionalized based on interannual precipitation variability using Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) data for the period 1981-2014. A number of data processing techniques and clustering algorithms are tested to ensure a robust definition of climate regions. These regionalization results highlight the seasonal and even month-to-month specificity of regional climate associations across the continent, emphasizing the need to consider time of year as well as research question when defining a coherent region for climate analysis. CHIRPS regions are then compared to those of five GCMs for the historic period, with a focus on boreal summer. Results show that some GCMs capture the climatic coherence of the Sahel and associated teleconnections in a manner that is similar to observations, while other models break the Sahel into uncorrelated subregions or produce a Sahel-like region of variability that is spatially displaced from observations. Finally, shifts in climate regions under projected twenty-first-century climate change for different GCMs and emissions pathways are examined. A projected change is found in the coherence of the Sahel, in which the western and eastern Sahel become distinct regions with different teleconnections. This pattern is most pronounced in high-emissions scenarios.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006337', 'afid': '60006337', 'affilname': 'NASA Goddard Space Flight Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Greenbelt', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002442', 'afid': '60002442', 'affilname': 'Universities Space Research Association', 'affiliation-city': 'Columbia', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Badr H.', 'Dezfuli A.', 'Zaitchik B.', 'Peters-Lidard C.']","['36720018400', '8554764800', '6507498114', '6701845806']",Africa | Climate change | Climate models | Climate variability | Interannual variability | Precipitation,,undefined,,,1211235

The effects of development and the uncertainty of a changing climate in eastern Africa pose myriad challenges for water managers along the Blue Nile. Sudan's large irrigation potential, hydroelectric dams, and prime location within the basin mean that Sudan's water management decisions will have great social, economic and political implications for the region. At the same time, Sudan's water use options are constrained by tradeoffs between upstream irrigation developments and downstream hydropower facilities as well as by the country's commitments under existing or future transboundary water sharing agreements. Here, we present a model that can be applied to evaluate optimal allocation of surface water resources to irrigation and hydropower in the Sudanese portion of the Blue Nile. Hydrologic inputs are combined with agronomic and economic inputs to formulate an optimization model within the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). A sensitivity analysis is performed by testing model response to a range of economic conditions and to changes in the volume and timing of hydrologic flows. Results indicate that changing hydroclimate inputs have the capacity to greatly influence the productivity of Sudan's water resource infrastructure. Results also show that the economically optimal volume of water consumption, and thus the importance of existing treaty constraints, is sensitive to the perceived value of agriculture relative to electricity as well as to changing hydrological conditions.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Satti S.', 'Zaitchik B.', 'Siddiqui S.']","['57194234585', '6507498114', '57195021018']",,NASA,NNX09AT61G,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,1211235

In the past decade, machine learning methods for empirical rainfall&ndash;runoff modeling have seen extensive development and been proposed as a useful complement to physical hydrologic models, particularly in basins where data to support process-based models are limited. However, the majority of research has focused on a small number of methods, such as artificial neural networks, despite the development of multiple other approaches for non-parametric regression in recent years. Furthermore, this work has often evaluated model performance based on predictive accuracy alone, while not considering broader objectives, such as model interpretability and uncertainty, that are important if such methods are to be used for planning and management decisions. In this paper, we use multiple regression and machine learning approaches (including generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural networks, random forests, and M5 cubist models) to simulate monthly streamflow in five highly seasonal rivers in the highlands of Ethiopia and compare their performance in terms of predictive accuracy, error structure and bias, model interpretability, and uncertainty when faced with extreme climate conditions. While the relative predictive performance of models differed across basins, data-driven approaches were able to achieve reduced errors when compared to physical models developed for the region. Methods such as random forests and generalized additive models may have advantages in terms of visualization and interpretation of model structure, which can be useful in providing insights into physical watershed function. However, the uncertainty associated with model predictions under extreme climate conditions should be carefully evaluated, since certain models (especially generalized additive models and multivariate adaptive regression splines) become highly variable when faced with high temperatures.",45,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shortridge J.', 'Guikema S.', 'Zaitchik B.']","['56024247600', '55892955400', '6507498114']",,,undefined,,,1211235

For this reason, adaptation planning efforts frequently focus on natural resource conservation as the primary motivation for and primary outcome of adaptation activities. Here, we present an analysis of the sustainability of community based adaptation (CBA) activities in 20 community based organizations (CBO) that were established in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia in order to promote resilience to climate change. CBA sustainability was assessed through multi-criteria analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Sustainability was considered for social, institutional, technical, financial, and environmental dimensions, with second-order indicators or factors defined for each dimension. According to this analysis, CBA efforts of two thirds of the COBs studied were found to be unsustainable in all dimensions and CBA efforts of the remaining CBOs were found to be at risk of unsustainability. A number of barriers to CBA sustainability were identified, including inadequacies in community participation, training of local community members, local government commitment, farmer capacity, and bureaucratic efficiency. Participatory evaluation of CBA, however, revealed that many of these barriers can be attributed to the decision to use conservation of natural resources as the primary framework for CBA activities. Based on this evaluation, new efforts have been developed that use markets as the entry and exit points for sustainability activities.

Background: In Ethiopia, child undernutrition remains to be a major public health challenge and a contributing factor for child mortality and morbidity. To reduce the problem, it is apparent to identify determinants of child undernutrition in specific contexts to deliver appropriately, targeted, effective and sustainable interventions. Methods: An agroecosystem linked cross-sectional survey was conducted in 3108 children aged 6-59 months. Multistage cluster sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, child anthropometry and on potential immediate, underlying and basic individual and community level determinants of child undernutrition using the UNICEF conceptual framework. Analysis was done using STATA 13 after checking for basic assumptions of linear regression. Important variables were selected and individual and community level determinants of child height-for-age Z score were identified. P values less than 0.05 were considered the statistical level of significance. Results: In the intercept only model and full models, 3.8% (p < 0.001) and 1.4% (p < 0.001) of the variability were due to cluster level variability. From individual level factors, child age in months, child sex, number of under five children, immunization status, breast feeding initiation time, mother nutritional status, diarrheal morbidity, household level water treatment and household dietary diversity were significant determinants of child height for age Z score. Also from community level determinants, agroecosystem type, liquid waste disposal practice and latrine utilization were significantly associated with child height-for-age Z score. Conclusion: In this study, a statistical significant heterogeneity of child height-for-age Z score was observed among clusters even after controlling for potential confounders. Both individual and community level factors, including the agroecosystem characteristics had a significant role in determining child height-for-age Z score in the study area. In addition to the existing efforts at the individual levels to improve child nutritional status, agroecosystem and community WASH related interventions should get more attention to improve child nutritional status in the study area.",7,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109514', 'afid': '60109514', 'affilname': 'Debre Markos University', 'affiliation-city': 'Debre Markos', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071181', 'afid': '60071181', 'affilname': 'Addis Ababa University', 'affiliation-city': 'Addis Ababa', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Alemu Z.', 'Ahmed A.', 'Yalew A.', 'Birhanu B.', 'Zaitchik B.']","['57202557784', '57143339400', '54581929000', '56990065400', '6507498114']",Amhara regional state | Children | East gojjam zone | Ethiopia | Multilevel | Stunting,,undefined,,,1211235

From the perspective of floods, flash droughts, and agriculture, variability on intraseasonal time scales is a critical component of total variability. The principal objective of this study is to explore subseasonal impacts of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) on tropospheric circulations affecting East Africa (EA) during the long (March-May) and short (October-December) rains and associated variability in precipitation. Analyses are performed for 1979-2012 for dynamics and 1998-2012 for precipitation. Consistent with previous studies, significant MJO influence is found on wet and dry spells during the long and short rains. This influence, however, is found to vary within each season. Specifically, indices of MJO convection at 70°-80°E and 120°W are strongly associated with precipitation variability across much of EA in the early (March) and late (May) long rainy season and in the middle and late (November-December) short rainy season. In the early short rains (October) a different pattern emerges, in which MJO strength at 120°E (10°W) is associated with dry (wet) spells in coastal EA but not the interior. In April the MJO influence on precipitation is obscured but can be diagnosed in lead time associations.

In the face of deeply uncertain climate change projections, robust decision frameworks are becoming a popular tool for incorporating climate change uncertainty into water infrastructure planning. These methodologies have the potential to be particularly valuable in developing countries where extensive infrastructure development is still needed and uncertainties can be large. However, many applications of these methodologies have relied on a sophisticated process of climate model downscaling and impact modeling that may be unreliable in data-scarce contexts. In this study, we demonstrate a modified application of the robust decision making (RDM) methodology that is specifically tailored for application in data-scarce situations. This modification includes a novel method for generating transient climate change sequences that account for potential variable dependence but do not rely on detailed GCM projections, and an emphasis on identifying the relative importance of data limitations and uncertainty within an integrated modeling framework. We demonstrate this methodology in the Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia, showing how the approach can highlight the vulnerability of alternative plans across different time scales and identify priorities for research and model refinement. We find that infrastructure performance is particularly sensitive to uncertainty in streamflow model accuracy, irrigation efficiency, and evaporation rates, suggesting that additional research in these areas could provide valuable insights for long-term infrastructure planning. This work demonstrates how tailored application of robust decision frameworks using simple modeling approaches can provide decision support in data-scarce regions where more complex modeling and analysis may be impractical.",9,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090', 'afid': '60027090', 'affilname': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Blacksburg', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778', 'afid': '60025778', 'affilname': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-city': 'Ann Arbor', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Shortridge J.', 'Guikema S.', 'Zaitchik B.']","['56024247600', '55892955400', '6507498114']",,NSF,1211235,National Science Foundation,,1211235

In topographically diverse highland terrain, socio-economic and environmental conditions can vary dramatically over relatively short distances. This presents a challenge for climate resilient development strategies, as exposure to climate variability and change, climate impacts, and adaptive capacity differ between communities located within common cultural and administrative units. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framed within the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC) offers a tool to assess climate vulnerability through direct household surveys. This makes it particularly appropriate for analyses at sub-community and community scales. Here we apply the LVI-IPCC to communities of Choke Mountain, located in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia. Recognizing the physiographic and climatic diversity that exists in this mountainous environment, we implement LVI-IPCC analysis for 793 mixed crop-livestock farming households using the five distinct agroecological systems (AES) that compose the populated area of Choke Mountain as a framework for analysis. For each AES, an LVI index, adaptive capacity metric, and LVI-IPCC vulnerability score was calculated. We found that each of these metrics varied systematically across AES. High elevation sloping lands and low elevation steep lands exhibited relatively low adaptive capacity and high vulnerability while midland AES had higher capacity and lower vulnerability. These results suggest that resilience building interventions for Choke Mountain ecosystems should be targeted to address the specific circumstances of each AES. The approach of applying LVI-IPCC at AES scale could be applicable to other climate vulnerable mountainous regions.",38,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071181', 'afid': '60071181', 'affilname': 'Addis Ababa University', 'affiliation-city': 'Addis Ababa', 'affiliation-country': 'Ethiopia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179', 'afid': '60032179', 'affilname': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliation-city': 'Madison', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248', 'afid': '60005248', 'affilname': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'affiliation-city': 'Baltimore', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Simane B.', 'Zaitchik B.', 'Foltz J.']","['6603056316', '6507498114', '7003668907']",Adaptive capacity | Agroecosystem | Climate change | Exposure | Vulnerability,AAU,GEO-1211235,Addis Ababa University,,1211235

In many parts of the eastern US, the provision of ecosystem services depends on private land. In these regions, decisions about land management and conservation made by private landowners can have significant effects on habitat and other ecosystem services. Advancing permanent conservation of land can be particularly challenging in dynamic rural-to-urban landscapes facing development pressures. We estimated private landowner ""conservation awareness"" using a mail survey instrument to assess relative familiarity, knowledge, and experience with various conservation and land management options. Conservation awareness differed significantly by town, implying hotspots and troughs of awareness, potentially leading to significant geographical variation in landowner decision-making and long-term conservation futures. We were surprised to find that conservation awareness did not necessarily diminish in more suburbanized environments of our study area. Higher conservation awareness was related to enhanced conservation social capital at the town level as well as relative affluence. We suggest that low conservation awareness could represent a precursor to or symptom of eventual land use change and hence loss of habitat. As a result, conservation efforts should focus not only on biophysical aspects such as habitat connectivity and rarity, but also on the conservation awareness of owners of private land.",8,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014313', 'afid': '60014313', 'affilname': 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'affiliation-city': 'Amherst MA', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007624', 'afid': '60007624', 'affilname': 'Harvard Forest', 'affiliation-city': 'Petersham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Kittredge D.', 'Short Gianotti A.', 'Hutyra L.', 'Foster D.', 'Getson J.']","['7003886116', '56499261400', '6507003616', '7403219324', '56499249800']",Decision-making | Development | Forest conservation | Non-industrial private landowner | Urban-to-rural gradient,NSF,BCS-1211802,National Science Foundation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0006320715000038,1211802

In the absence of binding international treaties or decisive U.S. federal policy for greenhouse gas regulation, cities have also become leaders in greenhouse gas reduction efforts through climate action plans. These plans focus on anthropogenic carbon flows only, however, ignoring a potentially substantial contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations from biological respiration. Our aim was to measure the contribution of CO2 efflux from soil respiration to atmospheric CO2 fluxes using an automated CO2 efflux system and to use these measurements to model urban soil CO2 efflux across an urban area. We find that growing season soil respiration is dramatically enhanced in urban areas and represents levels of CO2 efflux of up to 72% of FFCO2 within greater Boston's residential areas, and that soils in urban forests, lawns, and landscaped cover types emit 2.62 ± 0.15, 4.49 ± 0.14, and 6.73 ± 0.26 μmolCO2 m-2 s-1, respectively, during the growing season. These rates represent up to 2.2 times greater soil respiration than rates found in nearby rural ecosystems in central Massachusetts (MA), a potential consequence of imported carbon amendments, such as mulch, within a general regime of landowner management.

Women who fight in wars also have to fight for their right to do so. But what are the obstacles impeding their progress in achieving equal status as both active service members and as veterans? This book, written by a team of female veterans and military scholars, demonstrates the ways in which women service members and veterans experience a unique set of challenges when attempting to both honorably serve their country and reintegrate into civilian society following military service. These challenges include - but are not limited to - discrimination, staggering rates of suicide, and barriers to obtaining treatment for military sexual trauma and other critical benefits through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Women Veterans: Lifting the Veil of Invisibility examines current service-related policies and gender in the military’s hierarchical power structure. Here, a confluence of white male privilege and entitlement, the culture of domination, and the effeminization of the enemy manifest themselves as a backlash against women, calling into question a woman’s agency and her very status as a citizen. Special attention in the book is paid to the civil-military divide, representative bureaucracy, and the function of the military and civilian justice systems. Moreover, the need for appropriate healthcare policies and structures is examined within a ‘wicked problems’ framework.

Although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests, no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the Mongol Empire. Here we present a 1,112-y tree-ring reconstruction of warm-season water balance derived from Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) trees in central Mongolia. Our reconstruction accounts for 56% of the variability in the regional water balance and is significantly correlated with steppe productivity across central Mongolia. In combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction, our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of Chinggis Khan's (Genghis Khan's) 13th-century Mongol Empire was warm and persistently wet. This period, characterized by 15 consecutive years of above-average moisture in central Mongolia and coinciding with the rise of Chinggis Khan, is unprecedented over the last 1,112 y. We propose that these climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power. Tree-ring and meteorological data also suggest that the early 21st-century drought in central Mongolia was the hottest drought in the last 1,112 y, consistent with projections of warming over Inner Asia.

To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a 0.5 × 0.5 data set of global burned area from 1901 to 2007 by coupling Global Fire Emission Database version 3 with a process-based fire model and conducted factorial simulation experiments to evaluate the impacts of human, climate, and atmospheric components. The average global burned area is ~442 × 104 km2 yr-1 during 1901-2007 and our results suggest a notable declining rate of burned area globally (1.28 × 104 km2 yr-1). Burned area in tropics and extratropics exhibited a significant declining trend, with no significant trend detected at high latitudes. Factorial experiments indicated that human activities were the dominant factor in determining the declining trend of burned area in tropics and extratropics, and climate variation was the primary factor controlling the decadal variation of burned area at high latitudes. Elevated CO2 and nitrogen deposition enhanced burned area in tropics and southern extratropics but suppressed fire occurrence at high latitudes. Rising temperature and frequent droughts are becoming increasingly important and expected to increase wildfire activity in many regions of the world. ©2014. American Geophysical Union.

None of them, however, considered multifaceted environmental drivers and the coupled analysis of historical reports and natural archives. Here we investigate annually resolved, absolutely dated and spatially explicit paleoclimatic evidence between 1230 and 1250 CE. Documentary sources and tree-ring chronologies reveal warm and dry summers from 1238-1241, followed by cold and wet conditions in early-1242. Marshy terrain across the Hungarian plain most likely reduced pastureland and decreased mobility, as well as the military effectiveness of the Mongol cavalry, while despoliation and depopulation ostensibly contributed to widespread famine. These circumstances arguably contributed to the determination of the Mongols to abandon Hungary and return to Russia. While overcoming deterministic and reductionist arguments, our environmental hypothesis demonstrates the importance of minor climatic fluctuations on major historical events.",17,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027485', 'afid': '60027485', 'affilname': 'Institute for Advanced Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020486', 'afid': '60020486', 'affilname': 'University of Bern', 'affiliation-city': 'Bern', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008588', 'afid': '60008588', 'affilname': 'Eidgenössische Forschungsanstalt fur Wald, Schnee Und Landschaft Eth-Bereichs', 'affiliation-city': 'Birmensdorf', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116206527', 'afid': '116206527', 'affilname': 'Global Change Research Centre AS CR', 'affiliation-city': 'Brno', 'affiliation-country': 'Czech Republic'}]",Journal,Article,"['Büntgen U.', 'Di Cosmo N.']","['10140927300', '7801566244']",,,undefined,,,1210360

All rights reserved. Climatic changes during the first half of the Common Era have been suggested to play a role in societal reorganizations in Europe and Asia. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil. Our understanding of the magnitude and spatial extent as well as the possible causes and concurrences of climate change during this period is, however, still limited. Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD (ref.), which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, as well as a solar minimum. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere, we suggest that this cold phase be considered as an additional environmental factor contributing to the establishment of the Justinian plague, transformation of the eastern Roman Empire and collapse of the Sasanian Empire, movements out of the Asian steppe and Arabian Peninsula, spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China.",190,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103885', 'afid': '60103885', 'affilname': 'Sukachev Institute of Forest of the Siberian Branch of the RAS', 'affiliation-city': 'Krasnoyarsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60075346', 'afid': '60075346', 'affilname': 'Siberian Federal University', 'affiliation-city': 'Krasnoyarsk', 'affiliation-country': 'Russian Federation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031216', 'afid': '60031216', 'affilname': 'Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz', 'affiliation-city': 'Mainz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028564', 'afid': '60028564', 'affilname': 'Max Planck Institute for Meteorology', 'affiliation-city': 'Hamburg', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028378', 'afid': '60028378', 'affilname': 'Stockholms universitet', 'affiliation-city': 'Stockholm', 'affiliation-country': 'Sweden'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027485', 'afid': '60027485', 'affilname': 'Institute for Advanced Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025858', 'afid': '60025858', 'affilname': 'ETH Zürich', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich ZH,', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025641', 'afid': '60025641', 'affilname': 'Universität Freiburg im Breisgau', 'affiliation-city': 'Freiburg im Breisgau', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025288', 'afid': '60025288', 'affilname': 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht -

Hitherto, there has been no consensus on its age, with estimates spanning at least the tenth century CE. Here, we identify the cosmogenic radiocarbon signal of 775 CE in a subfossil larch engulfed and killed by pyroclastic currents emplaced during the initial rhyolitic phase of the explosive eruption. Combined with glaciochemical evidence from Greenland, this enables us to date the eruption to late 946 CE. This secure date rules out the possibility that the Millennium Eruption contributed to the collapse of the Bohai Kingdom (Manchuria/Korea) in 926 CE, as has previously been hypothesised. Further, despite the magnitude of the eruption, we do not see a consequent cooling signal in tree-ring-based reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures. A tightly-constrained date for the Millennium Eruption improves the prospect for further investigations of historical sources that may shed light on the eruption's impacts, and enhances the value of the B-Tm ash as a chronostratigraphic marker.",42,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60101360', 'afid': '60101360', 'affilname': 'Laboratoire de géographie physique et environnementale, Clermont-Ferrand', 'affiliation-city': 'Clermont-Ferrand', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031216', 'afid': '60031216', 'affilname': 'Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz', 'affiliation-city': 'Mainz', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031101', 'afid': '60031101', 'affilname': 'University of Cambridge', 'affiliation-city': 'Cambridge', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027485', 'afid': '60027485', 'affilname': 'Institute for Advanced Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025858', 'afid': '60025858', 'affilname': 'ETH Zürich', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich ZH,', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020486', 'afid': '60020486', 'affilname': 'University of Bern', 'affiliation-city': 'Bern', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020195', 'afid': '60020195', 'affilname': 'Paul Scherrer Institut', 'affiliation-city': 'Villigen', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019816', 'afid': '60019816', 'affilname': 'Leiden University', 'affiliation-city': 'Leiden', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860', 'afid': '60009860', 'affilname': 'Fudan University', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009016', 'afid': '60009016', 'affilname': 'Birkbeck University of London', 'affiliation-city': 'London', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008588', 'afid': '60008588', 'affilname': 'Eidgenössische Forschungsanstalt fur Wald, Schnee Und Landschaft Eth-Bereichs', 'affiliation-city': 'Birmensdorf', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004718', 'afid': '60004718', 'affilname': 'Université de Genève', 'affiliation-city': 'Geneva', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003725', 'afid': '60003725', 'affilname': 'China Earthquake Administration', 'affiliation-city': 'Beijing', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",Journal,Article,"['Oppenheimer C.', 'Wacker L.', 'Xu J.', 'Galván J.D.', 'Stoffel M.', 'Guillet S.', 'Corona C.', 'Sigl M.', 'Di Cosmo N.', 'Hajdas I.', 'Pan B.', 'Breuker R.', 'Schneider L.', 'Esper J.', 'Fei J.', 'Hammond J.O.S.', 'Büntgen U.']","['7005631653', '6603463064', '55645751500', '55342194400', '57202563842', '55886663400', '36143932300', '35168107300', '7801566244', '57203030970', '57206682366', '54929091000', '55759708900', '8576228100', '36815482800', '24764933600', '10140927300']",Cosmogenic isotopes | Eastern Asia | Holocene | Ice cores | Paleoclimatology | Tree-rings,NERC,come30001,Natural Environment Research Council,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0277379116305017,1210360

Meanwhile, encroachment by peri-urban development, landless farmers, and Prosopis juliflora has reduced inflow and tank capacity. This exploratory study presents a conceptual framework and proposed indicator set for measuring water security in the context of rainwater harvesting tanks. The primary benefits of tanks and threats to their functionality are profiled as a precursor to construction of a causal network of water security. The causal network identifies the key components, causal linkages, and outcomes of water security processes, and is used to derive a suite of indicators that reflect the multiple economic and socio-ecological uses of tanks.

This is concerning, as vegetation die-off is expected to reduce the marshes' capacity to adapt to sea level rise by vegetation-induced sediment accretion. Quantitative analyses of the spatial and temporal development of marsh vegetation die-off are scarce, although these are needed to understand the bio-geomorphic feedback effects of vegetation die-off on flow, erosion, and sedimentation. In this study, we quantified the spatial and temporal development of marsh vegetation die-off with aerial images from 1938 to 2010 in a submerging coastal marsh along the Blackwater River (Maryland, U.S.A). Our results indicate that die-off begins with conversion of marsh vegetation into bare open water pools that are relatively far (> 75 m) from tidal channels. As vegetation die-off continues, pools expand, and new pools emerge at shorter and shorter distances from channels. Consequently larger pools are found at larger distances from the channels. Our results suggest that the size of the pools and possibly the connection of pools with the tidal channel system have important bio-geomorphic implications and aggravate marsh deterioration. Moreover, we found that the temporal development of vegetation die-off in moderately degraded marshes is similar as the spatial die-off development along a present-day gradient, which indicates that the contemporary die-off gradient might be considered a chronosequence that offers a unique opportunity to study vegetation die-off processes.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016053', 'afid': '60016053', 'affilname': 'Virginia Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Gloucester Point', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012937', 'afid': '60012937', 'affilname': 'Universiteit Antwerpen', 'affiliation-city': 'Antwerpen', 'affiliation-country': 'Belgium'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004404', 'afid': '60004404', 'affilname': 'Patuxent Wildlife Research Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Laurel', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Schepers L.', 'Kirwan M.', 'Guntenspergen G.', 'Temmerman S.']","['56085586900', '10044268300', '6603361494', '6602902860']",,,LTER 1237733,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,,1426308

The sustainability of marshes adjacent to coastal bays is driven by the exchange of sediment across the marsh-bay boundary, where edge erosion commonly leads to lateral marsh loss and enhanced vertical accretion. The timing and patterns of sediment deposition on salt marshes adjacent to larger bodies of water such as coastal bays, however, differ from those on better-studied tidal creek marshes primarily owing to the importance of wind-waves. We combined field measurements and modeling to examine controls on suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes on a tidal flat (tidal range of 1.2 m) and rates of sediment deposition on the adjacent marsh at a site on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Suspended sediment concentrations over tidal flats were strongly controlled by waves. Yet, storm winds sufficient to drive large resuspension events often coincided with peak tidal elevations that were too low to flood the marsh, which was oriented away from the wind directions most favorable for storm surge, thereby restricting storm-driven, episodic sediment delivery to the marsh. Winds also drove wide variability in the direction of surface currents near the marsh edge when water depths were high enough to flood the marsh. Nevertheless, our results show that sediment in the upper water column over the tidal flat was effectively transported across the marsh edge during flooding tides. A sediment deposition model developed to investigate the combined effects of vegetation and wave action on depositional patterns predicted that waves displace maximum deposition inland from the marsh edge, consistent with measured deposition at the study site. Marsh deposition was sensitive to inundation frequency as well as the concentration of sediment in water flooding the marsh, underscoring the importance of nontidal controls on water surface elevation, such as meteorological effects (e.g., storm surge) and sea level rise. Whereas short-term increases in marsh inundation enhance deposition, sea level rise that results in deeper average water depths over the tidal flats decreases deposition if marsh elevation is rising in step with sea level.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021918', 'afid': '60021918', 'affilname': 'University of Virginia', 'affiliation-city': 'Charlottesville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020096', 'afid': '60020096', 'affilname': 'Duke University Marine Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Beaufort', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016053', 'afid': '60016053', 'affilname': 'Virginia Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Gloucester Point', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Duvall M.', 'Wiberg P.', 'Kirwan M.']","['56330715400', '7004126924', '10044268300']",Salt marsh | Sea-level rise | Sediment deposition | Sediment flux | Shallow coastal bays | Storms | Suspended sediment concentrations,NSF,1237733,National Science Foundation,,1426308

Tidal marshes rank among Earth's vulnerable ecosystems, which will retreat if future rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) exceed marshes' ability to accrete vertically. Here, we assess the limits to marsh vulnerability by analyzing >780 Holocene reconstructions of tidal marsh evolution in Great Britain. These reconstructions include both transgressive (tidal marsh retreat) and regressive (tidal marsh expansion) contacts. The probability of a marsh retreat was conditional upon Holocene rates of RSLR, which varied between -7.7 and 15.2 mm/yr. Holocene records indicate that marshes are nine times more likely to retreat than expand when RSLR rates are ≥7.1 mm/yr. Coupling estimated probabilities of marsh retreat with projections of future RSLR suggests a major risk of tidal marsh loss in the twenty-first century.

We find that marsh loss is nearly inevitable where topographic and anthropogenic barriers limit migration. Where unconstrained by barriers, however, rates of marsh migration are much more sensitive to accelerated sea level rise than rates of edge erosion.

Previous results show that overwash provides an important sediment source to back-barrier marshes, sustaining a narrow marsh state under conditions in which marsh drowning would otherwise occur. We expand the coupled barrier island-marsh evolution model GEOMBEST+ to explore the effects of wind waves on back-barrier marshes. We find that the addition of marsh edge erosion leads to wider, more resilient marshes and that horizontal erosion of the marsh edge is a more efficient sediment source than vertical erosion of the marsh surface as it drowns. Where marshes and bays are vertically keeping up with sea level, and the net rate of sediment imported to (or exported from) the basin is known, the rate of marsh edge erosion or progradation can be predicted knowing only the present basin geometry, sea level rise rate, and the net rate of sediment input (without considering the erosion or progradation mechanisms). If the rate of sediment input/export is known, this relationship applies whether sediment exchange with the open ocean is negligible (as in basins dominated by riverine sediment input) or is significant (including the loss of sediment remobilized by waves in the bay). Analysis of these results reveals that geometry and stratigraphy can exert a first-order control on back-barrier marsh evolution and on the marsh-barrier island system as a whole and provides new insights into the resilience of back-barrier marshes and on the interconnectedness of the barrier-marsh system. Plain Language Summary Sand washed across barrier islands during storms (called overwash) provides sediment for salt marshes behind those islands, and can allow a marsh which otherwise would drown to grow vertically fast enough to keep up with sea level. We use a barrier island-marsh evolution model (GEOMBEST+) to see what effect marsh edge erosion by waves has on overwash-supported marshes. Consistent with previous research, we find that wave erosion can make marshes more resilient by freeing sediment that can be used elsewhere on the marsh surface. We add that horizontal erosion of the marsh edge provides more sediment per volume eroded than vertical erosion of the marsh surface. This is because the bottom layers of the marsh contain more sediment (that can stay on marsh surfaces), while the surface layers include plant material (that drifts away or decomposes). We also find that when the marsh and bay are keeping up with sea level, expanding or eroding the marsh is the only way to change the volume of the bay, so how fast the marsh is expanding or eroding can be predicted using geometry, knowing only the size of the basin, sea-level-rise rate, and the net rate of sediment import or export.",5,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016053', 'afid': '60016053', 'affilname': 'Virginia Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Gloucester Point', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724', 'afid': '60008724', 'affilname': 'Duke University', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Lauzon R.', 'Murray A.', 'Moore L.', 'Walters D.', 'Kirwan M.', 'Fagherazzi S.']","['57201272380', '57192172539', '7401847647', '57188570898', '10044268300', '6701805445']",,NSF,DEB-123773,National Science Foundation,,1426308

In the mapped region (i.e., 25% of modern Chesapeake Bay marshland), 94 km2 of marsh was lost primarily to shoreline erosion, whereas 101 km2 of marsh was created by upland drowning. Simple projections over the entire Chesapeake region suggest that approximately 100,000 acres (400 km2) of uplands have converted to wetlands and that about a third of all present-day marsh was created by drowning of upland ecosystems since the late nineteenth century.

The sustainability of dynamic natural systems often depends on their capacity to adapt to uncertain climate-related changes, where different management options may be combined to facilitate this adaptation. Salt marshes exemplify such a system. Marsh sustainability under rapid sea level rise requires the preservation of transgression zones - undeveloped uplands onto which marshes migrate. Whether these uplands eventually become marsh depends on uncertain sea level rise and natural dynamics that determine migration onto different land types. Under conditions such as these, systematically diversified management actions generally outperform ad hoc or non-diversified alternatives.

Ghost forests, consisting of dead trees adjacent to marshes, are a striking feature of lowlying coastal and estuarine landscapes, and they represent the migration of coastal ecosystems with relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Although ghost forests have been observed along many coastal margins, rates of ecosystem change and their dependence on RSLR remain poorly constrained. Here, we reconstructed forest retreat rates using sediment coring and historical imagery at five sites along the Mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, a hotspot for accelerated RSLR. We found that the elevation of the marsh-forest boundary generally increased with RSLR over the past 2000 yr, and that retreat accelerated concurrently with the late 19th century acceleration in global sea level. Lateral retreat rates increased through time for most sampling intervals over the past 150 yr, and modern lateral retreat rates are 2 to 14 times faster than pre-industrial rates at all sites. Substantial deviations between RSLR and forest response are consistent with previous observations that episodic disturbance facilitates the mortality of adult trees.

Salt marshes are valued for their ecosystem services, and their vulnerability is typically assessed through biotic and abiotic measurements at individual points on the landscape. However, lateral erosion can lead to rapid marsh loss as marshes build vertically. Marsh sediment budgets represent a spatially integrated measure of competing constructive and destructive forces: a sediment surplus may result in vertical growth and/or lateral expansion, while a sediment deficit may result in drowning and/or lateral contraction. Here we show that sediment budgets of eight microtidal marsh complexes consistently scale with areal unvegetated/vegetated marsh ratios (UVVR) suggesting these metrics are broadly applicable indicators of microtidal marsh vulnerability. All sites are exhibiting a sediment deficit, with half the sites having projected lifespans of less than 350 years at current rates of sea-level rise and sediment availability. These results demonstrate that open-water conversion and sediment deficits are holistic and sensitive indicators of salt marsh vulnerability.",54,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016053', 'afid': '60016053', 'affilname': 'Virginia Institute of Marine Science', 'affiliation-city': 'Gloucester Point', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011347', 'afid': '60011347', 'affilname': 'United States Geological Survey', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000481', 'afid': '60000481', 'affilname': 'Università degli Studi di Padova', 'affiliation-city': 'Padua', 'affiliation-country': 'Italy'}]",Journal,Article,"['Ganju N.K.', 'Defne Z.', 'Kirwan M.L.', 'Fagherazzi S.', ""D'Alpaos A."", 'Carniello L.']","['6603421362', '6503982040', '10044268300', '6701805445', '6506326460', '23003812100']",,,undefined,,,1426308

To ensure the correctness of network analysis methods, the network (as the input) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data. However, when representing sequential data from complex systems, such as global shipping traffic or Web clickstream traffic as networks, conventional network representations that implicitly assume the Markov property (first-order dependency) can quickly become limiting. This assumption holds that, when movements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on the current node, discounting the fact that the movement may depend on several previous steps. However, we show that data derived from many complex systems can show up to fifth-order dependencies. In these cases, the oversimplifying assumption of the first-order network representation can lead to inaccurate network analysis results. To address this problem, we propose the higher-order network (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders of dependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON, including accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existing suite of network analysis methods. We illustrate how HON can be applied to a broad variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering, and ranking, and we demonstrate that, by using it as input, HON yields more accurate results without any modification to these tasks.",36,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Xu J.', 'Wickramarathne T.', 'Chawla N.']","['56355199300', '35108503700', '35077581400']",,,undefined,,,1426973

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. The foundation for any ecological study and for the effective management of biodiversity in natural systems requires knowing what species are present in an ecosystem. We assessed fish communities in a stream using two methods, depletion-based electrofishing and environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) from water samples, to test the hypothesis that eDNA provides an alternative means of determining species richness and species identities for a natural ecosystem. In a northern Indiana stream, electrofishing yielded a direct estimate of 12 species and a mean estimated richness (Chao II estimator) of 16.6 species with a 95% confidence interval from 12.8 to 42.2. eDNA sampling detected an additional four species, congruent with the mean Chao II estimate from electrofishing. This increased detection rate for fish species between methods suggests that eDNA sampling can enhance estimation of fish fauna in flowing waters while having minimal sampling impacts on fish and their habitat. Modern genetic approaches therefore have the potential to transform our ability to build a more complete list of species for ecological investigations and inform management of aquatic ecosystems.",46,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022812', 'afid': '60022812', 'affilname': 'Oceanic Institute an affiliate of Hawaii Pacific University', 'affiliation-city': 'Waimanalo', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009841', 'afid': '60009841', 'affilname': 'Central Michigan University', 'affiliation-city': 'Mount Pleasant', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001769', 'afid': '60001769', 'affilname': 'University of Nevada, Reno', 'affiliation-city': 'Reno', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Olds B.', 'Jerde C.', 'Renshaw M.', 'Li Y.', 'Evans N.', 'Turner C.', 'Deiner K.', 'Mahon A.', 'Brueseke M.', 'Shirey P.', 'Pfrender M.', 'Lodge D.', 'Lamberti G.']","['55286238600', '8574691500', '8205539000', '55955850800', '56047696900', '25230535700', '16027686900', '7005243200', '6507468958', '24448223800', '6603132922', '7101657153', '7004993649']",Chao estimator | electrofishing | freshwater community | metabarcoding | species identity,,undefined,,,1426973

Molecular Ecology Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd The genomic revolution has fundamentally changed how we survey biodiversity on earth. High-throughput sequencing (“HTS”) platforms now enable the rapid sequencing of DNA from diverse kinds of environmental samples (termed “environmental DNA” or “eDNA”). Coupling HTS with our ability to associate sequences from eDNA with a taxonomic name is called “eDNA metabarcoding” and offers a powerful molecular tool capable of noninvasively surveying species richness from many ecosystems. Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.",197,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105121', 'afid': '60105121', 'affilname': 'Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences', 'affiliation-city': 'Aberystwyth', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032619', 'afid': '60032619', 'affilname': 'Université Laval', 'affiliation-city': 'Quebec', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029526', 'afid': '60029526', 'affilname': 'University of California, Riverside', 'affiliation-city': 'Riverside', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025779', 'afid': '60025779', 'affilname': 'Bangor University', 'affiliation-city': 'Bangor', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021508', 'afid': '60021508', 'affilname': 'University of Notre Dame', 'affiliation-city': 'Notre Dame', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012614', 'afid': '60012614', 'affilname': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005517', 'afid': '60005517', 'affilname': 'Wellcome Sanger Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Hinxton', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002612', 'afid': '60002612', 'affilname': 'Eawag - Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology', 'affiliation-city': 'Dubendorf', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100847039', 'afid': '100847039', 'affilname': 'National Botanic Garden of Wales', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}]",Journal,Review,"['Deiner K.', 'Bik H.', 'Mächler E.', 'Seymour M.', 'Lacoursière-Roussel A.', 'Altermatt F.', 'Creer S.', 'Bista I.', 'Lodge D.', 'de Vere N.', 'Pfrender M.', 'Bernatchez L.']","['16027686900', '57210975650', '55365166600', '55344176300', '26641910800', '16686534500', '57188762757', '21740779100', '7101657153', '23488430200', '6603132922', '7005123164']",bioinformatic pipeline | biomonitoring | citizen science | conservation | ecology | eDNA | invasive species | macro-organism | species richness,DOD,W912HQ-12-C-0073,U.S. Department of Defense,,1426973

All rights reserved. Risk analysis of species invasions links biology and economics, is increasingly mandated by international and national policies, and enables improved management of invasive species. Biological invasions proceed through a series of transition probabilities (i.e., introduction, establishment, spread, and impact), and each of these presents opportunities for management. Recent research advances have improved estimates of probability and associated uncertainty. Improvements have come from species-specific trait-based risk assessments (of estimates of introduction, establishment, spread, and impact probabilities, especially from pathways of commerce in living organisms), spatially explicit dispersal models (introduction and spread, especially from transportation pathways), and species distribution models (establishment, spread, and impact). Results of these forecasting models combined with improved and cheaper surveillance technologies and practices [e.g., environmental DNA (eDNA), drones, citizen science] enable more efficient management by focusing surveillance, prevention, eradication, and control efforts on the highest-risk species and locations. Bioeconomic models account for the interacting dynamics within and between ecological and economic systems, and allow decision makers to better understand the financial consequences of alternative management strategies. In general, recent research advances demonstrate that prevention is the policy with the greatest long-term net benefit.",58,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url':

Because significant global changes are currently underway in the Arctic, creating a large-scale standardized database for Arctic marine biodiversity is particularly pressing. This study evaluates the potential of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to detect Arctic coastal biodiversity changes and characterizes the local spatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in two locations. We extracted and amplified eDNA using two COI primer pairs from ~80 water samples that were collected across two Canadian Arctic ports, Churchill and Iqaluit based on optimized sampling and preservation methods for remote regions surveys. Results demonstrate that aquatic eDNA surveys have the potential to document large-scale Arctic biodiversity change by providing a rapid overview of coastal metazoan biodiversity, detecting nonindigenous species, and allowing sampling in both open water and under the ice cover by local northern-based communities. We show that DNA sequences of ~50% of known Canadian Arctic species and potential invaders are currently present in public databases. A similar proportion of operational taxonomic units was identified at the species level with eDNA metabarcoding, for a total of 181 species identified at both sites. Despite the cold and well-mixed coastal environment, species composition was vertically heterogeneous, in part due to river inflow in the estuarine ecosystem, and differed between the water column and tide pools. Thus, COI-based eDNA metabarcoding may quickly improve large-scale Arctic biomonitoring using eDNA, but we caution that aquatic eDNA sampling needs to be standardized over space and time to accurately evaluate community structure changes.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032619', 'afid': '60032619', 'affilname': 'Université Laval', 'affiliation-city': 'Quebec', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012614', 'afid': '60012614', 'affilname': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010833', 'afid': '60010833', 'affilname': 'Fisheries and Oceans Canada', 'affiliation-city': 'Ottawa', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009614', 'afid': '60009614', 'affilname': 'St. Andrews Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada', 'affiliation-city': 'St Andrews', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121016739', 'afid': '121016739', 'affilname': 'Division of Science', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,,"['Lacoursière-Roussel A.', 'Howland K.', 'Normandeau E.', 'Grey E.', 'Archambault P.', 'Deiner K.', 'Lodge D.', 'Hernandez C.', 'Leduc N.', 'Bernatchez L.']","['26641910800', '6701805429', '23095645600', '6603864727', '7004147881', '16027686900', '7101657153', '57190674456', '57203143043', '7005123164']",Arctic | Coastal biodiversity | eDNA metabarcoding | Global changes | Invasion | Spatio-temporal distribution,,undefined,,,1426973

We consider two components of risk – introduction and establishment. Risk of introduction is based on economic modeling predictions of changes in trade flows from future opening of Arctic shipping. Risk of establishment given successful introduction is based on climate similarities determined by an environmental model. We estimate total NIS spread risk as the product of introduction and establishment risks. Results highlight risk profiles for key U.S. trade partners in Asia and show that NIS spread risk to the U.S. east coast is highest from China and Japan. Shipments from Hong Kong and the Philippines present nominal increased species spread risk to the U.S. given low levels of terrestrial and marine climate similarity and minor expected trade changes between the two regions.,0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031791', 'afid': '60031791', 'affilname': 'Governors State University', 'affiliation-city': 'University Park', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002722', 'afid': '60002722', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Nong D.', 'Warziniack T.', 'Countryman A.', 'Grey E.']","['57193762491', '34574105700', '57190044836', '6603864727']",Climate matching | GTAP | Nonindigenous species | Risk assessment | Trade,NIFA,1002351,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1462901118309778,1426973

To meet local and global aspirations toward sustainable resource management, we must first understand what success looks like. At global levels, well-being can be narrowly defined, which may clash with local values and cause adverse impacts. Melanesia is home to a complex mosaic of resource management systems, and finding locally appropriate indicators of success poses particular challenges. We propose that biocultural approaches can assist in developing grounded and appropriate well-being indicators. Biocultural approaches frame issues from the perspectives of place-based communities and work with resource users to develop desired outcomes. In doing so, biocultural approaches recognize links between people and the environment and seek to understand feedbacks between social and ecological components. Biocultural approaches may help to improve the fit between local aspirations and national or international actions and can also cocreate knowledge that draws on local knowledge and practice as well as western science. Here, we report on one such approach in Western Province, Solomon Islands, where rural communities are weighing a variety of trade-offs around the use of natural resources. The work encompasses four locations and seeks to define local needs and priorities, develop appropriate local indicators of success, assess indicator baselines, and catalyze appropriate action. Implementation challenges have included scaffolding between local and national levels and the diversity of the four locations. These have, however, been offset by the engaged nature of indicator creation, which assists communities in planning toward action around local definitions of wellbeing.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004', 'afid': '60031004', 'affilname': 'The University of Queensland', 'affiliation-city': 'Brisbane', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011425', 'afid': '60011425', 'affilname': 'American Museum of Natural History', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120513762', 'afid': '120513762', 'affilname': 'Coastal Marine Management', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120513709', 'afid': '120513709', 'affilname': 'Vavanga', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120513625', 'afid': '120513625', 'affilname': 'Biche', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120513429', 'afid': '120513429', 'affilname': 'Nia Tero', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120513354', 'afid': '120513354', 'affilname': 'West Parara', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120512988', 'afid': '120512988', 'affilname': 'Munda', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120512982', 'afid': '120512982', 'affilname': 'Zaira', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117845370', 'afid': '117845370', 'affilname': 'Solomon Islands Community Conservation Partnership', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117187081', 'afid': '117187081', 'affilname': 'Ecological Solutions Solomon Islands', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Solomon Islands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/105932670', 'afid': '105932670', 'affilname': 'New York City Department of Parks and Recreation', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100615803', 'afid': '100615803', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'Suva', 'affiliation-country': 'Fiji'}]",Journal,Article,"['McCarter J.', 'Sterling E.', 'Jupiter S.', 'Cullman G.', 'Albert S.', 'Basi M.', 'Betley E.', 'Boseto D.', 'Bulehite E.', 'Harron R.', 'Holland P.', 'Horning N.', 'Hughes A.', 'Jino N.', 'Malone C.', 'Mauli S.', 'Pae B.', 'Papae R.', 'Rence F.', 'Revo O.', 'Taqala E.', 'Taqu M.', 'Woltz H.', 'Filardi C.']","['54400288800', '7003855330', '23990559200', '26422808500', '8512278400', '57201520639', '57193362435', '12785271200', '57201520729', '57201527166', '57201518849', '6603559581', '57201522752', '57201527040', '57193360735', '57192369560', '57201518305', '57201522148', '57201526664', '57201518797', '57201525669', '57201521456', '24831256600', '6602884889']",Biocultural | Indicators | Monitoring and evaluation | Resource management | Solomon islands | Western province,TNC,1444184,Nature Conservancy,,1427091

Monitoring and evaluation are central to ensuring that innovative, multi-scale, and interdisciplinary approaches to sustainability are effective. The development of relevant indicators for local sustainable management outcomes, and the ability to link these to broader national and international policy targets, are key challenges for resource managers, policymakers, and scientists. Sets of indicators that capture both ecological and social-cultural factors, and the feedbacks between them, can underpin cross-scale linkages that help bridge local and global scale initiatives to increase resilience of both humans and ecosystems. Here we argue that biocultural approaches, in combination with methods for synthesizing across evidence from multiple sources, are critical to developing metrics that facilitate linkages across scales and dimensions. Biocultural approaches explicitly start with and build on local cultural perspectives-encompassing values, knowledges, and needs-and recognize feedbacks between ecosystems and human well-being. Adoption of these approaches can encourage exchange between local and global actors, and facilitate identification of crucial problems and solutions that are missing from many regional and international framings of sustainability. Resource managers, scientists, and policymakers need to be thoughtful about not only what kinds of indicators are measured, but also how indicators are designed, implemented, measured, and ultimately combined to evaluate resource use and well-being. We conclude by providing suggestions for translating between local and global indicator efforts.",48,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url':

Measuring progress toward sustainability goals is a multifaceted task. International, regional, and national organizations and agencies seek to promote resilience and capacity for adaptation at local levels. However, their measurement systems may be poorly aligned with local contexts, cultures, and needs. Understanding how to build effective, culturally grounded measurement systems is a fundamental step toward supporting adaptive management and resilience in the face of environmental, social, and economic change. To identify patterns and inform future efforts, we review seven case studies and one framework regarding the development of culturally grounded indicator sets. Additionally, we explore ways to bridge locally relevant indicators and those of use at national and international levels. The process of identifying and setting criteria for appropriate indicators of resilience in social-ecological systems needs further documentation, discussion, and refinement, particularly regarding capturing feedbacks between biological and social-cultural elements of systems.",18,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013791', 'afid': '60013791', 'affilname': 'University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa', 'affiliation-city': 'Honolulu', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011425', 'afid': '60011425', 'affilname': 'American Museum of Natural History', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003342', 'afid': '60003342', 'affilname': 'USDA Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': 'Washington, D.C.', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001012', 'afid': '60001012', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101890357', 'afid': '101890357', 'affilname': 'National Center for Scientific Research', 'affiliation-city': 'Bellevue', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sterling E.', 'Ticktin T.', 'Morgan T.K.K.', 'Cullman G.', 'Alvira D.', 'Andrade P.', 'Bergamini N.', 'Betley E.', 'Burrows K.', 'Caillon S.', 'Claudet J.', 'Dacks R.', 'Eyzaguirre P.', 'Filardi C.', 'Gazit N.', 'Giardina C.', 'Jupiter S.', 'Kinney K.', 'McCarter J.', 'Mejia M.', 'Morishige K.', 'Newell J.', 'Noori L.', 'Parks J.', 'Pascua P.', 'Ravikumar A.', 'Tanguay J.', 'Sigouin A.', 'Stege T.', 'Stege M.', 'Wali A.']","['7003855330', '6602221644', '11939704000', '26422808500', '6507596848', '55388335300', '57195982683', '57193362435', '57195984291', '56168992300', '8275355900', '55885123000', '13806773500', '6602884889', '57195989159', '57204297643', '23990559200', '53981634800', '54400288800', '55795108800', '57195983957', '55359345700', '57195982618', '8555082700', '57195414986', '55270708500', '57195981902', '57192397294', '57195985879', '57195983225', '35872117400']",Biocultural indicators | Indicator sets | Indigenous peoples | Local communities | Resilience | Sustainability | Well-being,NCC,undefined,Nature Conservancy of Canada,,1427091

Remote island nations face a number of challenges in addressing concerns about shark population status, including access to rigorously collected data and resources to manage fisheries. At present, very little data are available on shark populations in the Solomon Islands and scientific surveys to document shark and ray diversity and distribution have not been completed. We aimed to provide a baseline of the relative abundance and diversity of reef sharks and rays and assess the major drivers of reef shark abundance/biomass in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands using stereo baited remote underwater video. On average reef sharks were more abundant than in surrounding countries such as Fiji and Indonesia, yet below that of remote islands without historical fishing pressure, suggesting populations are relatively healthy but not pristine. We also assessed the influence of location, habitat type/complexity, depth and prey biomass on reef shark abundance and biomass. Location was the most important factor driving reef shark abundance and biomass with two times the abundance and a 43% greater biomass of reef sharks in the more remote locations, suggesting fishing may be impacting sharks in some areas. Our results give a much needed baseline and suggest that reef shark populations are still relatively unexploited, providing an opportunity for improved management of sharks and rays in the Solomon Islands.",3,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031806', 'afid': '60031806', 'affilname': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031226', 'afid': '60031226', 'affilname': 'Curtin University', 'affiliation-city': 'Perth', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019870', 'afid': '60019870', 'affilname': 'James Cook University, Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Townsville', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011425', 'afid': '60011425', 'affilname': 'American Museum of Natural History', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001012', 'afid': '60001012', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121028205', 'afid': '121028205', 'affilname': 'Coastal and Marine Management', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Ireland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100615803', 'afid': '100615803', 'affilname': 'Wildlife Conservation Society', 'affiliation-city': 'Suva', 'affiliation-country': 'Fiji'}]",Journal,Article,"['Goetze J.', 'Langlois T.', 'McCarter J.', 'Simpfendorfer C.', 'Hughes A.', 'Leve J.', 'Jupiter S.']","['35777870400', '56258294000', '54400288800', '7006384244', '57201522752', '57203187283', '23990559200']",,WCS,13-105118-000-INP,Wildlife Conservation Society,,1427091

Hippopotami can play a significant role as ecosystem engineers and may play an important role as carbon and nutrient vectors from savanna grasslands to aquatic systems. We coupled the results of a feeding study of captive hippopotami, faeces leaching/mineralisation experiments, hippopotamus consumption estimates and the stoichiometry of savanna grasses to calculate excretion and egestion rates of hippopotami. We then used time budgets and population estimates to calculate nutrient loading by hippopotami in the Mara River, Kenya. In captivity, hippopotami consumed 11.0 g dry matter (DM) kg hippopotamus-1 day-1 (110.6 C; 6.8 N; 1.0 P) and egested 5.3 g DM kg-1 day-1. They excreted or egested 2.72 g C, 0.28 g N and 0.04 g P kg hippopotamus-1 day-1, and urine comprised 12% of C, 70% of N and 33% of P of total excretion and egestion. By integrating data from previously published work on hippopotamus digestion with the data we collected in the field, we estimated an average hippopotamus in the Mara River would excrete or egest 1.93-3.58 g DM, 0.78-1.47 g C, 0.13-0.19 g N and 0.01-0.02 g P kg hippopotamus-1 day-1, and that half of this excretion/egestion would enter the river. The hippopotamus population increased by 1500% inside the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, between 1959 and 2006. We estimate that hippopotami egest 36 200 kg faeces day-1 into the Mara River (wet mass). Daily loading into the river by excretion and egestion equals 8563 kg DM, 3499 kg C, 492 kg N and 48 kg P, which is equivalent to 670% of CPOM, 15% of DOC, 27% of TN and 29% of TP of loading from the upstream catchment. This research provides the first estimates for hippopotamus inputs to rivers that include both excretion and egestion and provides evidence that hippopotami are important resource vectors in sub-Saharan African rivers, even when compared to other sources of carbon and nutrients.",59,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Subalusky A.', 'Dutton C.', 'Rosi-Marshall E.', 'Post D.']","['26326511900', '55759606400', '6505822000', '7103012603']",Hippopotamus amphibius | Allochthonous resource | Animal subsidy | Egestion | Excretion,,undefined,,,1354062

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. The Mara River Basin in East Africa is a trans-boundary basin of international significance experiencing excessive levels of sediment loads. Sediment levels in this river are extremely high (turbidities as high as 6,000 NTU) and appear to be increasing over time. Large wildlife populations, unregulated livestock grazing, and agricultural land conversion are all potential factors increasing sediment loads in the semi-Arid portion of the basin. The basin is wellknown for its annual wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) migration of approximately 1.3 million individuals, but it also has a growing population of hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibius), which reside within the river and may contribute to the flux of suspended sediments. We used in situ pressure transducers and turbidity sensors to quantify the sediment flux at two sites for the Mara River and investigate the origin of riverine suspended sediment. We found that the combined Middle MaraDTalek catchment, a relatively flat but semi-Arid region with large populations of wildlife and domestic cattle, is responsible for 2/3 of the sediment flux. The sediment yield from the combined Middle Mara-Talek catchment is approximately the same as the headwaters, despite receiving less rainfall. There was high monthly variability in suspended sediment fluxes. Although hippopotamus pools are not a major source of suspended sediments under baseflow, they do contribute to short-Term variability in suspended sediments. This research identified sources of suspended sediments in the Mara River and important regions of the catchment to target for conservation, and suggests hippopotami may influence riverine sediment dynamics.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60037596', 'afid': '60037596', 'affilname': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliation-city': 'Nairobi', 'affiliation-country': 'Kenya'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dutton C.', 'Subalusky A.', 'Anisfeld S.', 'Njoroge L.', 'Rosi E.', 'Post D.']","['55759606400', '26326511900', '6506287945', '37047560300', '57192427561', '7103012603']",,,undefined,,,1354062

Organic matter and nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems affects ecosystem structure and function and can result in eutrophication and hypoxia. Hypoxia is often attributed to anthropogenic pollution and is not common in unpolluted rivers. Here we show that organic matter loading from hippopotami causes the repeated occurrence of hypoxia in the Mara River, East Africa. We documented 49 high flow events over 3 years that caused dissolved oxygen decreases, including 13 events resulting in hypoxia, and 9 fish kills over 5 years. Evidence from experiments and modeling demonstrates a strong mechanistic link between the flushing of hippo pools and decreased dissolved oxygen in the river. This phenomenon may have been more widespread throughout Africa before hippopotamus populations were severely reduced. Frequent hypoxia may be a natural part of tropical river ecosystem function, particularly in rivers impacted by large wildlife.",15,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707', 'afid': '60031707', 'affilname': 'Michigan State University', 'affiliation-city': 'East Lansing', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017474', 'afid': '60017474', 'affilname': 'Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliation-city': 'Millbrook', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dutton C.', 'Subalusky A.', 'Hamilton S.', 'Rosi E.', 'Post D.']","['55759606400', '57203455675', '7402244920', '57192427561', '7103012603']",,NGS,NCST/RRI/12/1/BS-011/25,National Geographic Society,,1354062

The common hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius ('hippo') is a keystone species whose foraging activities and behaviour have profound effects on the structure and dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems within its habitat. Although hippos are typically regarded as obligate herbivores and short-grass grazing specialists, field studies have demonstrated that hippos are facultative carnivores that consume flesh and intestinal tissues from the carcasses of other animals. Carnivory by hippos is not an aberrant behaviour restricted to particular individuals in certain localities, but a behaviour pattern that occurs within populations distributed in most of the hippo's current range in eastern and southern Africa. Carnivory is frequently associated with communal feeding involving multiple individuals or entire social groups of hippos. The observed tendency of hippos to feed on carcasses, including those of other hippos, has important implications for the ecology and epidemiology of anthrax and other ungulate-associated zoonotic diseases in African landscapes. Scavenging and carnivory by hippos may explain why the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of anthrax mortality among hippos often differ markedly from those of other anthrax-susceptible herbivores within the same habitats, and why levels of hippo mortality from anthrax may be orders of magnitude higher than those of other anthrax-susceptible ungulate populations within the same localities. Recognition of the role of carnivory as a key factor in modulating the dynamics of mass anthrax outbreaks in hippos can provide a basis for improved understanding and management of the effects of anthrax outbreaks in hippo and human populations.",11,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109509', 'afid': '60109509', 'affilname': 'Leidos Inc.', 'affiliation-city': 'Reston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072796', 'afid': '60072796', 'affilname': 'University of Zambia', 'affiliation-city': 'Lusaka', 'affiliation-country': 'Zambia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851', 'afid': '60026851', 'affilname': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016183', 'afid': '60016183', 'affilname': 'Robert Koch Institut', 'affiliation-city': 'Berlin', 'affiliation-country': 'Germany'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012614', 'afid': '60012614', 'affilname': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliation-city': 'Zurich', 'affiliation-country': 'Switzerland'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011976', 'afid': '60011976', 'affilname': 'University of Alaska Fairbanks', 'affiliation-city': 'Fairbanks', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116755318', 'afid': '116755318', 'affilname': 'Departamento de Colonia', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'Uruguay'}]",Journal,Review,"['Dudley J.P.', ""Hang'Ombe B.M."", 'Leendertz F.H.', 'Dorward L.J.', 'de Castro J.', 'Subalusky A.L.', 'Clauss M.']","['7102008768', '6602652387', '6602340558', '55226041300', '57189581576', '26326511900', '7006886894']",Anthrax | Carnivory | Hippopotamus | Predation | Scavenging,,undefined,,,1354062

Background: Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). Results: We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Conclusions: Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026479', 'afid': '60026479', 'affilname': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliation-city': 'Exeter', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Berdahl A.', 'Leeuwen A.', 'Levin S.', 'Torney C.']","['23479355600', '57195319007', '26643470900', '24588214300']",Anadromous fish | Collective navigation | Dispersal | Local adaptation | Migration | Migratory birds | Migratory marine fish | Migratory ungulates | Population collapse,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1426746

Climate change is often described as the greatest environmental challenge of our time. In addition, a changing climate can reallocate natural capital, change the value of all forms of capital and lead to mass redistribution of wealth. Here we explain how the inclusive wealth framework provides a means to measure shifts in the amounts and distribution of wealth induced by climate change. Biophysical effects on prices, pre-existing institutions and socio-ecological changes related to shifts in climate cause wealth to change in ways not correlated with biophysical changes. This implies that sustainable development in the face of climate change requires a coherent approach that integrates biophysical and social measurement. Inclusive wealth provides a measure that indicates sustainability and has the added benefit of providing an organizational framework for integrating the multiple disciplines studying global change.",25,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892', 'afid': '60003892', 'affilname': 'Arizona State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Tempe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Fenichel E.', 'Levin S.', 'McCay B.', 'St. Martin K.', 'Abbott J.', 'Pinsky M.']","['9335127600', '26643470900', '6603824509', '55663657100', '25121167800', '8608637700']",,NSF,OCE-1426746,NordForsk,,1426746

We use a simple dynamical model describing capital accumulation along the lines of a fixed-savings-ratio Solow-type model capable of producing endogenous growth and convergence behavior, and pollution accumulation in each country with pollution diffusion between countries or regions. The basic mechanism underlying the movements of capital across space is the quest for locations where the marginal productivity of capital is relatively higher than the productivity at the location of origin. The notion that capital moves to locations of relatively higher productivity but not necessarily from locations of high concentration to locations of low concentration, does not face difficulties associated with the Lucas paradox. We show that, for a wide range of capital and pollution rates of flow, spatial heterogeneity emerges even between two economies with identical fundamental structures. These results can be interpreted as suggesting that the neoclassical convergence hypothesis might not hold under differential rates of flow of capital and polluting activities among countries of the same fundamental structure.",0,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019507', 'afid': '60019507', 'affilname': 'Athens University of Economics and Business', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'Greece'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Levin S.', 'Xepapadeas A.']","['26643470900', '6701402028']",Capital | Diffusion | Pollution | Spatial heterogeneity | Transboundary flows | Turing instability,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1426746

Background: Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). Results: We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Conclusions: Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030961', 'afid': '60030961', 'affilname': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'affiliation-city': 'Santa Fe', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026479', 'afid': '60026479', 'affilname': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliation-city': 'Exeter', 'affiliation-country': 'United Kingdom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Berdahl A.', 'Leeuwen A.', 'Levin S.', 'Torney C.']","['23479355600', '57195319007', '26643470900', '24588214300']",Anadromous fish | Collective navigation | Dispersal | Local adaptation | Migration | Migratory birds | Migratory marine fish | Migratory ungulates | Population collapse,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1426746

All rights reserved. Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives - either economic or social norms, or both - can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.",46,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Lubchenco J.', 'Cerny-Chipman E.', 'Reimer J.', 'Levin S.']","['6701631227', '56829484100', '56828943000', '26643470900']",Complex adaptive systems | Conservation solutions | Fisheries | Marine reserves | Rights-based fishery management,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1426746

All rights reserved. Marine social-ecological systems are constantly changing, and fishers who make a living from working the seas are continually adapting in response to different sources of variability. One main way in which fishers can adapt to ecosystem change is to change the fisheries they participate in. This acts to connect fisheries, creating interlinked networks of alternative sources of income for fishers. Here, we synthesize fisheries data and construct fisheries connectivity networks for all major ports in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Fisheries connectivity networks are comprised of nodes, which are fisheries, connected by edges, whose weights are proportional to the number of participating vessels. Fisheries connectivity networks identify central fisheries in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, specifically Dungeness crab and Spiny Lobster, and systematic topological differences, e.g. in network resilience and modularity. These network metrics directly relate to the social vulnerability of coastal fishing communities, especially their sensitivity and capacity to adapt to perturbation. Ultimately, improving knowledge of fisheries connectivity is vital if policy makers are to create governance institutions that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental, technological and management change while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries. In doing so, new policies that account for fisheries connectivity, will lead to improved sustainable fisheries management, and enhanced socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities.",21,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008279', 'afid': '60008279', 'affilname': 'University of Maine', 'affiliation-city': 'Orono', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003723', 'afid': '60003723', 'affilname': 'NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Seattle', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

Coral communities continue to be threatened by chronic and acute stressors and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms that maintain their persistence. In this work, we use a model of coral-macroalgae dynamics to explore the effects of different assumptions regarding grazing and coral recruitment seasonality in coral-algae systems. We find that the grazing functional form constrains the potential for alternative stable states and coexistence, highlighting the need to further elucidate herbivore dynamics on reef systems. We also show that coral recruitment from external sources facilitates coral persistence and recovery, both when recruitment is assumed to be constant over time, and when recruitment occurs seasonally. In systems with alternative stable states, the total number of larvae that reaches a patch is the primary driver that dictates whether a system with low coral cover can flip into the coral-dominated basin of attraction. However, in a limited parameter space, the duration and timing of this larval pulse can also determine whether coral can recover in a bistable system. These results highlight the multiple factors that influence whether a coral reef is likely to remain in its present state or not, especially as ocean conditions change.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator–prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions.

Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator–prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions.

Coral communities continue to be threatened by chronic and acute stressors and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms that maintain their persistence. In this work, we use a model of coral-macroalgae dynamics to explore the effects of different assumptions regarding grazing and coral recruitment seasonality in coral-algae systems. We find that the grazing functional form constrains the potential for alternative stable states and coexistence, highlighting the need to further elucidate herbivore dynamics on reef systems. We also show that coral recruitment from external sources facilitates coral persistence and recovery, both when recruitment is assumed to be constant over time, and when recruitment occurs seasonally. In systems with alternative stable states, the total number of larvae that reaches a patch is the primary driver that dictates whether a system with low coral cover can flip into the coral-dominated basin of attraction. However, in a limited parameter space, the duration and timing of this larval pulse can also determine whether coral can recover in a bistable system. These results highlight the multiple factors that influence whether a coral reef is likely to remain in its present state or not, especially as ocean conditions change.",2,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402', 'afid': '60013402', 'affilname': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Corvallis', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001785', 'afid': '60001785', 'affilname': 'Kungl.

All rights reserved. Understanding why some renewable resources are overharvested while others are conserved remains an important challenge. Most explanations focus on institutional or ecological differences among resources. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that conservation and overharvest can be alternative stable states within the same exclusive-resource management system because of path-dependent processes, including slow institutional adaptation. Surprisingly, this theory predicts that the alternative states of strong conservation or overharvest are most likely for resources that were previously thought to be easily conserved under optimal management or even open access. Quantitative analyses of harvest rates from 217 intensely managed fisheries supports the predictions. Fisheries’ harvest rates also showed transient dynamics characteristic of path dependence, as well as convergence to the alternative stable state after unexpected transitions. This statistical evidence for path dependence differs from previous empirical support that was based largely on case studies, experiments, and distributional analyses. Alternative stable states in conservation appear likely outcomes for many cooperatively managed renewable resources, which implies that achieving conservation outcomes hinges on harnessing existing policy tools to navigate transitions.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60119141', 'afid': '60119141', 'affilname': 'Rutgers University–New Brunswick', 'affiliation-city': 'New Brunswick', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849', 'afid': '60016849', 'affilname': 'University of Toronto', 'affiliation-city': 'Toronto', 'affiliation-country': 'Canada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455', 'afid': '60005455', 'affilname': 'Yale University', 'affiliation-city': 'New Haven', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269', 'afid': '60003269', 'affilname': 'Princeton University', 'affiliation-city': 'Princeton', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Tekwa E.', 'Fenichel E.', 'Levin S.', 'Pinsky M.']","['56698256500', '9335127600', '26643470900', '8608637700']",Alternative stable states | Conservation | Fishery | Institution | Path dependence,NSF,OCE-1426746,National Science Foundation,,1426746

Salinization, a widespread threat to the structure and ecological functioning of inland and coastal wetlands, is currently occurring at an unprecedented rate and geographic scale. The causes of salinization are diverse and include alterations to freshwater flows, land-clearance, irrigation, disposal of wastewater effluent, sea level rise, storm surges, and applications of de-icing salts. Climate change and anthropogenic modifications to the hydrologic cycle are expected to further increase the extent and severity of wetland salinization. Salinization alters the fundamental physicochemical nature of the soil-water environment, increasing ionic concentrations and altering chemical equilibria and mineral solubility. Increased concentrations of solutes, especially sulfate, alter the biogeochemical cycling of major elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, and silica. The effects of salinization on wetland biogeochemistry typically include decreased inorganic nitrogen removal (with implications for water quality and climate regulation), decreased carbon storage (with implications for climate regulation and wetland accretion), and increased generation of toxic sulfides (with implications for nutrient cycling and the health/functioning of wetland biota). Indeed, increased salt and sulfide concentrations induce physiological stress in wetland biota and ultimately can result in large shifts in wetland communities and their associated ecosystem functions. The productivity and composition of freshwater species assemblages will be highly altered, and there is a high potential for the disruption of existing interspecific interactions. Although there is a wealth of information on how salinization impacts individual ecosystem components, relatively few studies have addressed the complex and often non-linear feedbacks that determine ecosystem-scale responses or considered how wetland salinization will affect landscape-level processes. Although the salinization of wetlands may be unavoidable in many cases, these systems may also prove to be a fertile testing ground for broader ecological theories including (but not limited to): investigations into alternative stable states and tipping points, trophic cascades, disturbance-recovery processes, and the role of historical events and landscape context in driving community response to disturbance.",182,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026306', 'afid': '60026306', 'affilname': 'University of Nebraska–Lincoln', 'affiliation-city': 'Lincoln', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021121', 'afid': '60021121', 'affilname': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliation-city': 'Bloomington', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016529', 'afid': '60016529', 'affilname': 'Radboud University Nijmegen', 'affiliation-city': 'Nijmegen', 'affiliation-country': 'Netherlands'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016280', 'afid': '60016280', 'affilname': 'East Carolina University', 'affiliation-city': 'Greenville', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012560', 'afid': '60012560', 'affilname': 'Northern Kentucky University', 'affiliation-city': 'Highland Heights', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010859', 'afid': '60010859', 'affilname': 'Federation University Australia', 'affiliation-city': 'Ballarat', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006234', 'afid': '60006234', 'affilname': 'Victoria University Melbourne', 'affiliation-city': 'Melbourne', 'affiliation-country': 'Australia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002476', 'afid': '60002476', 'affilname': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Herbert E.', 'Boon P.', 'Burgin A.', 'Neubauer S.', 'Franklin R.', 'Ardon M.', 'Hopfensperger K.', 'Lamers L.', 'Gell P.', 'Langley J.']","['55980152000', '55628577504', '57207523777', '7102853250', '7201428388', '12788079100', '14420038500', '7003439068', '7004028173', '7101653386']",Biodiversity | Biogeochemistry | Ecosystem services | Global change | Hydrology | Non-linear feedbacks | Salinification | Salinization | Saltwater intrusion | Wetland,,undefined,,,1355059

Salinity is a major driver of bacterial community composition across the globe. Despite growing recognition that different bacterial species are present or active at different salinities, the mechanisms by which salinity structures community composition remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that these patterns reflect ecological coherence in the salinity preferences of phylogenetic groups using a reciprocal transplant experiment of fresh- and saltwater wetland soils. The salinity of both the origin and host environments affected community composition (16S rRNA gene sequences) and activity (CO2 and CH4 production, and extracellular enzyme activity). These changes in community composition and activity rates were strongly correlated, which suggests the effect of environment on function could be mediated, at least in part, by microbial community composition. Based on their distribution across treatments, each phylotype was categorized as having a salinity preference (freshwater, saltwater, or none) and phylogenetic analyses revealed a significant influence of evolutionary history on these groupings. This finding was corroborated by examining the salinity preferences of high-level taxonomic groups. For instance, we found that the majority of α- and γ-proteobacteria in these wetland soils preferred saltwater, while many β-proteobacteria prefer freshwater. Overall, our results indicate the effect of salinity on bacterial community composition results from phylogenetically-clustered salinity preferences.",19,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023517', 'afid': '60023517', 'affilname': 'Northern Arizona University', 'affiliation-city': 'Flagstaff', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002476', 'afid': '60002476', 'affilname': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Morrissey E.', 'Franklin R.']","['36673604300', '7201428388']",Biogeochemistry | Community composition | Marsh | Methanogen | Phylogeny | Saltwater intrusion,NSF,DEB-1210357,National Science Foundation,,1355059

Sea-level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. The resulting changes in the soil environment would likely cause shifts in plant and microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. To simulate saltwater intrusion, we constructed a solar-powered automated irrigation system. The system consisted of holding tanks that were filled with freshwater or artificial brackish water during high tide. During low tide, the water was gravity-fed through solenoid valves and metered out to each plot. This system was controlled by an open-source microcontroller platform and built from off-the-shelf electronics at a cost of $1800. Porewater salinity in near-surface soils of the plots receiving brackish water was increased from freshwater to oligohaline levels within one month of operation and was maintained throughout the first summer of operation.

A mixing model derived from first principles describes the bulk density (BD) of intertidal wetland sediments as a function of loss on ignition (LOI). The model assumes that the bulk volume of sediment equates to the sum of self-packing volumes of organic and mineral components or BD = 1/[LOI/k1 + (1-LOI)/k2], where k1 and k2 are the self-packing densities of the pure organic and inorganic components, respectively. The model explained 78% of the variability in total BD when fitted to 5075 measurements drawn from 33 wetlands distributed around the conterminous United States. The values of k1 and k2 were estimated to be 0.085 ± 0.0007 g cm-3 and 1.99 ± 0.028 g cm-3, respectively. Based on the fitted organic density (k1) and constrained by primary production, the model suggests that the maximum steady state accretion arising from the sequestration of refractory organic matter is ≤ 0.3 cm yr-1. Thus, tidal peatlands are unlikely to indefinitely survive a higher rate of sea-level rise in the absence of a significant source of mineral sediment. Application of k2 to a mineral sediment load typical of East and eastern Gulf Coast estuaries gives a vertical accretion rate from inorganic sediment of 0.2 cm yr-1. Total steady state accretion is the sum of the parts and therefore should not be greater than 0.5 cm yr-1 under the assumptions of the model. Accretion rates could deviate from this value depending on variation in plant productivity, root:shoot ratio, suspended sediment concentration, sediment-capture efficiency, and episodic events.",77,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085748', 'afid': '60085748', 'affilname': 'University of San Francisco', 'affiliation-city': 'San Francisco', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029747', 'afid': '60029747', 'affilname': 'The University of Georgia', 'affiliation-city': 'Athens', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028707', 'afid': '60028707', 'affilname': 'Bates College', 'affiliation-city': 'Lewiston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027629', 'afid': '60027629', 'affilname': 'Belle W.

Saltwater intrusion associated with climate change is expected to dramatically affect the biogeochemistry of these soils and induce changes in the composition of the soil microbial community that may alter their ability to process nitrogen. In this study, the abundance and community structure of microorganisms associated with two key nitrate removal pathways – denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) – were assessed for eight tidal wetlands along a naturally-occurring salinity gradient (0–2 ppt) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (USA). Molecular analyses targeted functional genes specific for each pathway (denitrification: nirS and nosZ; DNRA: nrfA). Shifts in abundance and community structure of both groups of nitrate reducers were strongly coupled to changes in salinity, and correlation analyses suggested that the effect of salinity on these organisms may have been mediated, at least in part, by changes in soil organic matter availability. Considering the growing body of evidence that microbial community composition may help regulate ecosystem process rates, an increased understanding of how salinity affects nitrogen cycling microbial communities may help us better predict how wetland soil function will be affected by global change and issues such as sea level rise.",27,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021143', 'afid': '60021143', 'affilname': 'West Virginia University', 'affiliation-city': 'Morgantown', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002476', 'afid': '60002476', 'affilname': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Franklin R.', 'Morrissey E.', 'Morina J.']","['7201428388', '36673604300', '56080435400']",Denitrification | DNRA | Marsh | Microbial community structure | NirS | NosZ | NrfA | Saltwater intrusion | Sea level rise,,undefined,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031405616301391,1355059

Environmental changes can alter the interactions between biotic and abiotic ecosystem components in tidal wetlands and therefore impact important ecosystem functions. The objective of this study was to determine how saltwater intrusion affects wetland nutrient biogeochemistry, with a specific focus on the soil microbial communities and physicochemical parameters that control nitrate removal. Our work took place in a tidal freshwater marsh in South Carolina, USA, where a 3.5-year saltwater intrusion experiment increased porewater salinities from freshwater to oligohaline levels. We measured rates of denitrification, soil oxygen demand, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and used molecular genetic techniques to assess the abundance and community structure of soil microbes. In soils exposed to elevated salinities, rates of denitrification were reduced by about 70% due to changes in the soil physicochemical environment (higher salinity, higher carbon:nitrogen ratio) and shifts in the community composition of denitrifiers. Saltwater intrusion also affected the microbial community responsible for DNRA, increasing the abundance of genes associated with this process and shifting microbial community composition. Though rates of DNRA were below detection, the microbial community response may be a precursor to increased rates of DNRA with continued saltwater intrusion. Overall, saltwater intrusion reduces the ability of tidal freshwater marshes to convert reactive nitrogen to dinitrogen gas and therefore negatively affects their water quality functions. Continued study of the interrelationships between biotic communities, the abiotic environment, and biogeochemical transformations will lead to a better understanding of how the progressive replacement of tidal freshwater marshes with brackish analogues will affect the overall functioning of the coastal landscape.",4,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111', 'afid': '60025111', 'affilname': 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-city': 'Chapel Hill', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020138', 'afid': '60020138', 'affilname': 'Baruch Marine Field Laboratory', 'affiliation-city': 'Georgetown', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017574', 'afid': '60017574', 'affilname': 'Tropical Research &amp; Education Center', 'affiliation-city': 'Homestead', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002476', 'afid': '60002476', 'affilname': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Neubauer S.C.', 'Piehler M.F.', 'Smyth A.R.', 'Franklin R.B.']","['7102853250', '6603595090', '55349337300', '7201428388']",ecosystem ecology | global change | nitrogen cycle | salinization | sea level rise | wetland,USC,DEB-1355059,University of South Carolina,,1355059

Saltwater intrusion modifies soil physicochemistry and can immediately affect microbial metabolism, but further alterations to biogeochemical processing can occur over time as microbial communities adapt to the changed environmental conditions. To assess temporal changes in microbial community composition and biogeochemical activity due to saltwater intrusion, soil cores were transplanted from a tidal freshwater marsh to a downstream mesohaline marsh and periodically sampled over 1 year. This experimental saltwater intrusion produced immediate changes in carbon mineralization rates, whereas shifts in the community composition developed more gradually. Salinity affected the composition of the prokaryotic community but did not exert a strong influence on the community composition of fungi. After only 1 week of saltwater exposure, carbon dioxide production doubled and methane production decreased by three orders of magnitude. By 1 month, carbon dioxide production in the transplant was comparable to the saltwater controls. Over time, we observed a partial recovery in methane production which strongly correlated with an increase in the relative abundance of three orders of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Taken together, our results suggest that ecosystem responses to saltwater intrusion are dynamic over time as complex interactions develop between microbial communities and the soil organic carbon pool. The gradual changes in microbial community structure we observed suggest that previously freshwater wetlands may not experience an equilibration of ecosystem function until long after initial saltwater intrusion. Our results suggest that during this transitional period, likely lasting years to decades, these ecosystems may exhibit enhanced greenhouse gas production through greater soil respiration and continued methanogenesis.",6,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021143', 'afid': '60021143', 'affilname': 'West Virginia University', 'affiliation-city': 'Morgantown', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002476', 'afid': '60002476', 'affilname': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'affiliation-city': 'Richmond', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Dang C.', 'Morrissey E.', 'Neubauer S.', 'Franklin R.']","['57204943538', '36673604300', '7102853250', '7201428388']",carbon biogeochemistry | methanogenesis | microbial community composition | saltwater intrusion | soil | succession | sulfate-reducing bacteria,NSF,DEB 1645596,National Science Foundation,,1355059

In this review, we discuss spatial patterns and effects of N deposition and tropospheric O3 on net greenhouse-gas fluxes in North American forest and grassland ecosystems. While projected rates of ammonia emissions and deposition are expected to remain unchanged, projected declines in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions within the US will likely lead to reductions in total N deposition and O3.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company. All rights reserved. • Background and Aims: Many individual studies have shown that the timing of leaf senescence in boreal and temperate deciduous forests in the northern hemisphere is influenced by rising temperatures, but there is limited consensus on the magnitude, direction and spatial extent of this relationship. • Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted of published studies from the peer-reviewed literature that reported autumn senescence dates for deciduous trees in the northern hemisphere, encompassing 64 publications with observations ranging from 1931 to 2010. • Key Results: Among the meteorological measurements examined, October temperatures were the strongest predictors of date of senescence, followed by cooling degree-days, latitude, photoperiod and, lastly, total monthly precipitation, although the strength of the relationships differed between high- and low-latitude sites. Autumn leaf senescence has been significantly more delayed at low (25° to 49°N) than high (50° to 70°N) latitudes across the northern hemisphere, with senescence across high-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of photoperiod and low-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of temperature. Delays in leaf senescence over time were stronger in North America compared with Europe and Asia. • Conclusions: The results indicate that leaf senescence has been delayed over time and in response to temperature, although low-latitude sites show significantly stronger delays in senescence over time than high-latitude sites. While temperature alone may be a reasonable predictor of the date of leaf senescence when examining a broad suite of sites, it is important to consider that temperature-induced changes in senescence at high-latitude sites are likely to be constrained by the influence of photoperiod. Ecosystem-level differences in the mechanisms that control the timing of leaf senescence may affect both plant community interactions and ecosystem carbon storage as global temperatures increase over the next century.",86,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Gill A.', 'Gallinat A.', 'Sanders-DeMott R.', 'Rigden A.', 'Short Gianotti D.', 'Mantooth J.', 'Templer P.']","['56718641300', '55973447500', '56971445700', '56610379200', '56971594600', '56120004700', '6602781232']",Autumn phenology | climate change | deciduous tree | growing season | leaf senescence | temperature | woody plants,,undefined,,,1149929

In the absence of binding international treaties or decisive U.S. federal policy for greenhouse gas regulation, cities have also become leaders in greenhouse gas reduction efforts through climate action plans. These plans focus on anthropogenic carbon flows only, however, ignoring a potentially substantial contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations from biological respiration. Our aim was to measure the contribution of CO2 efflux from soil respiration to atmospheric CO2 fluxes using an automated CO2 efflux system and to use these measurements to model urban soil CO2 efflux across an urban area. We find that growing season soil respiration is dramatically enhanced in urban areas and represents levels of CO2 efflux of up to 72% of FFCO2 within greater Boston's residential areas, and that soils in urban forests, lawns, and landscaped cover types emit 2.62 ± 0.15, 4.49 ± 0.14, and 6.73 ± 0.26 μmolCO2 m-2 s-1, respectively, during the growing season. These rates represent up to 2.2 times greater soil respiration than rates found in nearby rural ecosystems in central Massachusetts (MA), a potential consequence of imported carbon amendments, such as mulch, within a general regime of landowner management.

Over the next century, air temperature increases up to 5°C are projected for the northeastern United States. As evapotranspiration strongly influences water loss from terrestrial ecosystems, the ecophysiological response of trees to warming will have important consequences for forest water budgets. We measured growing season sap flow rates in mature northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) trees in a combined air (up to 5.5°C above ambient) and soil (up to 1.85°C above ambient at 6-cm depth) warming experiment at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, United States. Through principal components analysis, we found air and soil temperatures explained the largest amount of variance in environmental variables associated with rates of sap flow, with relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation and vapor pressure deficit having significant, but smaller, effects. On average, each 1°C increase in temperature increased sap flow rates by approximately 1100 kg H2O m-2 sapwood area day-1 throughout the growing season and by 1200 kg H2O m-2 sapwood area day-1 during the early growing season. Reductions in the number of cold winter days correlated positively with increased sap flow during the early growing season (a decrease in 100 heating-degree days was associated with a sapflow increase in approximately 5 kg H2O m-2 sapwood area day-1).

Snow cover is projected to decline during the next century in many ecosystems that currently experience a seasonal snowpack. Because snow insulates soils from frigid winter air temperatures, soils are expected to become colder and experience more winter soil freeze-thaw cycles as snow cover continues to decline. Tree roots are adversely affected by snowpack reduction, but whether loss of snow will affect root-microbe interactions remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to distinguish and attribute direct (e.g., winter snow-and/or soil frost-mediated) vs. indirect (e.g., root-mediated) effects of winter climate change on microbial biomass, the potential activity of microbial exoenzymes, and net N mineralization and nitrification rates. Soil cores were incubated in situ in nylon mesh that either allowed roots to grow into the soil core (2 mm pore size) or excluded root ingrowth (50 μm pore size) for up to 29 months along a natural winter climate gradient at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH (USA). Microbial biomass did not differ among ingrowth or exclusion cores. Across sampling dates, the potential activities of cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase, and net N mineralization rates were more strongly related to soil volumetric water content (P < 0.05; R2 = 0.25-0.46) than to root biomass, snow or soil frost, or winter soil temperature (R2 < 0.10). Root ingrowth was positively related to soil frost (P < 0.01; R2 = 0.28), suggesting that trees compensate for overwinter root mortality caused by soil freezing by re-allocating resources towards root production. At the sites with the deepest snow cover, root ingrowth reduced nitrification rates by 30% (P < 0.01), showing that tree roots exert significant influence over nitrification, which declines with reduced snow cover. If soil freezing intensifies over time, then greater compensatory root growth may reduce nitrification rates directly via plant-microbe N competition and indirectly through a negative feedback on soil moisture, resulting in lower N availability to trees in northern hardwood forests.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032706', 'afid': '60032706', 'affilname': 'Miami University', 'affiliation-city': 'Oxford', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024878', 'afid': '60024878', 'affilname': 'Vassar College', 'affiliation-city': 'Poughkeepsie', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023908', 'afid': '60023908', 'affilname': 'Portland State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Portland', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023814', 'afid': '60023814', 'affilname': 'Brooklyn College', 'affiliation-city': 'New York', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020985', 'afid': '60020985', 'affilname': 'Universidade de Coimbra', 'affiliation-city': 'Coimbra', 'affiliation-country': 'Portugal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776', 'afid': '60007776', 'affilname': 'Cornell University', 'affiliation-city': 'Ithaca', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sorensen P.', 'Templer P.', 'Christenson L.', 'Duran J.', 'Fahey T.', 'Fisk M.', 'Groffman P.', 'Morse J.', 'Finzi A.']","['55992489500', '6602781232', '7004283657', '22952909200', '35502101300', '7006710408', '56885159000', '36605009200', '7005483704']",Hubbard Brook | Nitrification | Phenol oxidase | Root production | Snow | Soil frost | Sugar maple (Acer saccharum),USDOE,10-DOE- 1053,U.S. Department of Energy,,1149929

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2017 British Ecological Society Ecosystem-scale climate warming experiments have provided insight into the future dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. In seasonally snow covered regions, changes in winter soil temperatures are largely mediated through shifts in depth and duration of snowpack that have implications for ecosystem processes. Despite known effects of changes in snowpack dynamics on ecosystem processes in seasonally snow covered environments, the extent to which warming experiments address winter climate change is unclear. Identifying how previous warming studies have addressed changes in winter climate is important for understanding what is known about interacting effects of climate change across seasons and to highlight gaps in our understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change throughout the year. We reviewed 64 published ecosystem-scale climate change manipulation experiments spanning three decades that were conducted in seasonally snow covered regions and simulated warmer growing season temperatures. We found that only 20% of experiments in snow covered ecosystems explicitly manipulated the winter climate to reflect projected changes in winter soil temperatures mediated through changes in snowpack over the next several decades. Experiments that manipulated both winter and the growing season climate employed a variety of passive and active warming methods. Above-ground active methods most realistically simulated projected changes in soil temperature that will be mediated through changes in snow cover. Experiments with distinct winter treatments were distributed among tundra, forest, grassland and wetland ecosystems and together show that shifts in winter climate have a strong influence on, and in some cases offset, observed responses to experimental warming in the growing season alone or across the year. By designing climate change experiments that examine the effects of winter and growing season climate change together, there is an opportunity to develop a better mechanistic understanding and more accurate projections of ecosystem responses to climate change that would not be evident from examining changes in either season alone.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Review,"['Sanders-DeMott R.', 'Templer P.']","['56971445700', '6602781232']",ecosystem warming | global change | nutrient cycling | snow addition | snow removal | soil freezing | soil warming,NSF,DGE0947950,National Science Foundation,,1149929

Growing season warming and winter soil freeze-thaw cycles also resulted in a two-fold reduction in phenol oxidase activity and a 20% reduction in peroxidase activity and these declines persisted throughout the snow-free time of the year.

The combined effects of these changes in climate will lead to warmer soils in the growing season and increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in winter due to the loss of a continuous, insulating snowpack. Previous experiments have warmed soils or removed snow via shoveling or with shelters to mimic projected declines in the winter snowpack. To our knowledge, no experiment has examined the interactive effects of declining snowpack and increased frequency of soil FTCs, combined with soil warming in the snow-free season on terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, none have mimicked directly the projected increase in soil FTC frequency in tall statured forests that is expected as a result of a loss of insulating snow in winter. We established the Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in 2012 to assess the combined effects of these changes in climate on a variety of pedoclimate conditions, biogeochemical processes, and ecology of northern hardwood forests. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of creating soil FTC events in a tall statured ecosystem in winter to simulate the projected increase in soil FTC frequency over the next century and combines this projected change in winter climate with ecosystem warming throughout the snow-free season. Together, this experiment provides a new and more comprehensive approach for climate change experiments that can be adopted in other seasonally snow-covered ecosystems to simulate expected changes resulting from global air temperature rise.",13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027576', 'afid': '60027576', 'affilname': 'University of New Hampshire Durham', 'affiliation-city': 'Durham', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119023199', 'afid': '119023199', 'affilname': 'US Forest Service', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110755776', 'afid': '110755776', 'affilname': 'Research Designs', 'affiliation-city': None, 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Templer P.', 'Reinmann A.', 'Sanders-Demott R.', 'Sorensen P.', 'Juice S.', 'Bowles F.', 'Sofen L.', 'Harrison J.', 'Halm I.', 'Rustad L.', 'Martin M.', 'Grant N.']","['6602781232', '53064483000', '56971445700', '55992489500', '13606512100', '7003448269', '47361633400', '57193327796', '57193327129', '7003307911', '57214667606', '57193324325']",,,undefined,,,1149929

By contrast, little is known about tree growth response to projected declines in winter snowpack and increases in soil freezing in seasonally snow-covered forest ecosystems, despite extensive documentation of the importance of winter climate in mediating ecological processes. We conducted a 5-year snow-removal experiment whereby snow was removed for the first 4–5 weeks of winter in a northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. Our results indicate that adverse impacts of reduced snowpack and increased soil freezing on the physiology of Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a dominant species across northern temperate forests, are accompanied by a 40 ± 3% reduction in aboveground woody biomass increment, averaged across the 6 years following the start of the experiment. Further, we find no indication of growth recovery 1 year after cessation of the experiment. Based on these findings, we integrate spatial modeling of snowpack depth with forest inventory data to develop a spatially explicit, regional-scale assessment of the vulnerability of forest aboveground growth to projected declines in snowpack depth and increased soil frost. These analyses indicate that nearly 65% of sugar maple basal area in the northeastern United States resides in areas that typically experience insulating snowpack. However, under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emissions scenarios, we project a 49%–95% reduction in forest area experiencing insulating snowpack by the year 2099 in the northeastern United States, leaving large areas of northern forest vulnerable to these changes in winter climate, particularly along the northern edge of the region.

We conducted a 2-year (2014–2015) experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA to characterize the response of root damage, nitrogen uptake capacity, and soil solution nitrogen to growing season warming combined with soil freeze–thaw cycles in winter.

During the peak growing season (July), root nitrogen uptake capacity was reduced 40% by warming alone and 49% by warming combined with freeze–thaw cycles. These results indicate the projected combination of colder soils in winter and warmer soils in the snow-free season will alter root function by reducing root nitrogen uptake capacity and lead to transient increases of nitrogen in soil solution during the early growing season, with the potential to alter root competition for soil nitrogen and seasonal patterns of soil nitrogen availability.

Journal of Ecology © 2017 British Ecological Society Northern forest ecosystems are projected to experience warmer growing seasons, as well as winters with reduced snowpack depth and duration. Reduced snowpack will expose soils to cold winter air and lead to increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. The interactions between warmer soils in the growing season and colder soils in winter may have important implications for the phenology, productivity and nutrient content of forest plants. We conducted an experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, USA, to examine the effects of growing season warming, reduced depth and duration of winter snowpack, as well as increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles on sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum) saplings. We examined the direct effects of soil temperatures on plant root health, timing of leaf-out, foliar nitrogen, rates of photosynthesis and growth, as well as the indirect effects of snowpack reduction on herbivory on plant stems. A smaller winter snowpack and increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter led to increased root damage and delayed leaf-out for maple saplings. Snowpack reduction decreased rates of stem herbivory in winter, indicating that alleviation of above-ground stem damage in winters with reduced snowpack may offset the root damage incurred from successive soil freeze-thaw cycles in winters with low snowpack. Synthesis. By examining the response of two dominant tree species to simulated climate change in both the growing season and winter, we find that plant responses are mediated through a combination of changes in soil temperature and plant–herbivore interactions that differentially affect above- and below-ground plant components. These results highlight the feedbacks between trophic levels that shape forest function and demonstrate the need for considering climate change across seasons in global change experiments to determine how forest function may change in the future.",14,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674', 'afid': '60019674', 'affilname': 'Boston University', 'affiliation-city': 'Boston', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Sanders-DeMott R.', 'McNellis R.', 'Jabouri M.', 'Templer P.']","['56971445700', '57202512177', '57212712663', '6602781232']",freeze-thaw | nutrient cycling | photosynthesis | plant–climate interactions | plant–herbivore interactions | productivity | subnivean,DEB,1114804,Division of Environmental Biology,,1149929

As a result of climate change, growing season precipitation regimes are predicted to become more variable, with larger event sizes and longer dry periods resulting in more temporally dynamic soil moisture regimes. Increased climate variability is likely to interact with other disturbances, such as grazing, in grassland ecosystems. We investigated the individual and combined effects of increased rainfall variability and grazing on plant community composition, structure and function in an annually burned, native tallgrass prairie. Our overarching question was: are grazing impacts modified under a more variable precipitation regime? Location: Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA. Methods: Plots were established within a long-term rainfall manipulation experiment in which larger, but less frequent, rain events were imposed during the growing season without altering the total rain amount. We then simulated intense grazing pressure during one growing season by repeatedly clipping all graminoids to 5 cm and monitored recovery over 3 yr. Results: Neither grazing nor rainfall treatments affected species richness; however, grazing decreased total and grass above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and increased forb ANPP relative to ungrazed plots. Grass stem density recovered from intense grazing under ambient rainfall but did not fully recover, even after 2 yr in the altered rainfall treatment. Conclusions: We found that increased rainfall variability had little effect on tallgrass prairie structure and function, while grazing had large effects. Grazing and increased rainfall variability interacted to suppress grass stem density and delayed recovery relative to controls. Although stem density was reduced, individual stem size increased, resulting in no net change in ANPP. This suggests that ANPP in grazed and ungrazed North American tallgrass prairie may be relatively resilient under more temporally variable precipitation regimes. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.",16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033021', 'afid': '60033021', 'affilname': 'The University of New Mexico', 'affiliation-city': 'Albuquerque', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Koerner S.', 'Collins S.', 'Blair J.', 'Knapp A.', 'Smith M.']","['55195834300', '7402535701', '7203040256', '7102421547', '8947893100']",Annual net primary production | Climate change | Clipping | Disturbance | Diversity | Grass-forb interaction | Konza | Precipitation | Stem density,,undefined,,,1257183

We used a 15-year precipitation manipulation experiment to determine if altering the timing and amount of growing season rainfall will impact plant community structure in annually burned, native tallgrass prairie. The altered precipitation treatment maintained the same total growing season precipitation as the ambient precipitation treatment, but received a rainfall regime of fewer, larger rain events, and longer intervals between events each growing season. Although this change in precipitation regime significantly lowered mean soil water content, overall this plant community was remarkably resistant to altered precipitation with species composition relatively stable over time. However, we found significantly higher forb cover and richness and slightly lower grass cover on average with altered precipitation, but the forb responses were manifest only after a ten-year lag period. Thus, although community structure in this grassland is relatively resistant to this type of altered precipitation regime, forb abundance in native tallgrass prairie may increase in a future characterized by increased growing season precipitation variability.",22,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033021', 'afid': '60033021', 'affilname': 'The University of New Mexico', 'affiliation-city': 'Albuquerque', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000689', 'afid': '60000689', 'affilname': 'Kansas State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Manhattan', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Jones S.', 'Collins S.', 'Blair J.', 'Smith M.', 'Knapp A.']","['57102354100', '7402535701', '7203040256', '8947893100', '7102421547']",,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1257183

New Phytologist © 2016 New Phytologist Trust (Table presented.). Summary: Precipitation (PPT) is a primary climatic determinant of plant growth and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) over much of the globe. Thus, PPT–ANPP relationships are important both ecologically and to land–atmosphere models that couple terrestrial vegetation to the global carbon cycle. Empirical PPT–ANPP relationships derived from long-term site-based data are almost always portrayed as linear, but recent evidence has accumulated that is inconsistent with an underlying linear relationship. We review, and then reconcile, these inconsistencies with a nonlinear model that incorporates observed asymmetries in PPT–ANPP relationships. Although data are currently lacking for parameterization, this new model highlights research needs that, when met, will improve our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics, as well as forecasts of ecosystem responses to climate change.",76,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029937', 'afid': '60029937', 'affilname': 'Universite de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines', 'affiliation-city': 'Versailles', 'affiliation-country': 'France'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226', 'afid': '60009226', 'affilname': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliation-city': 'Fort Collins', 'affiliation-country': 'United States'}]",Journal,Article,"['Knapp A.', 'Ciais P.', 'Smith M.']","['7102421547', '55399842300', '8947893100']",carbon cycle | climate change | climate extremes | drought | precipitation | productivity | variability,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,,1257183

All rights reserved. The majority of the Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12-17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon-climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.",301,"[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affiliation-url': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121456', 'afid': '60121456', 'affilname': 'Energy &amp; Resources
